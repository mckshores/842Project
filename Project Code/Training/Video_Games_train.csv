"Good additional memory card, and significantly larger than the original 2-4 MB cards that the old PS2's originally came with. So far we've had no issues with saving games to the this card, and it should stand us in good stead for all of the old games we still like to replay.",5.0

"You read right. 128MB. Not the normal 8MB almost all the cards were.

Perfct,5.0
"It works great, I transferred all of my info from my other memory card and it works great. the only thing I noticed one of the screws was a little loose but I read that's how it supposed to be, if they are too tight card may not work. I'm a happy camper now because I can play all my old PS 2 games again.",5.0
"All I can say is... wow. This works perfect. It is more space than I will ever need, but the more the merrier. Right? Oh, one more thing: A lot of people said that it takes a long time to save, and boy they were right! Plus, I unscrewed the screws slightly so the little PCB chip moves around a bit. It came in an OK time, but gosh it was worth it.",5.0
it`s good.,5.0
My old PS2 is now running faster and it is much more enjoyable with the new memory card.  Great value!,5.0

Worked just fine for my nephew's PS2. No complaints.,5.0
"Amazing. More memory than I could possibly ever need. When I first saw this I thought it would be an obvious choice due to memory size and pricing, but then I read the the card can often be extremely slow or even not work. I decided to risk it and buy it anyways, and have had absolutely no problems, saves only taking up to 30 seconds on average.",5.0

Lots of room on this card great product u have to get this thing plenty of space for more than u could every play,5.0
I can't tell to much about this item. But my son was very happy because now he can save is games as he plays.,5.0
It works.  Which is something I worry about when buying aftermarket online. 128MB was the biggest I could find for my playstation two.,5.0
Works great! And so much less expensive than the used 8 meg cards being sold. This is a no brainer. Will probably end up getting another one soon.,5.0
"My daughter found the old PS2 game system for her youngest son and didn't have but one or two games, no memory cards, etc. We found what we needed on Amazon!",5.0
"These cards allow me to save a large amount of downloads, and they are compatable with my PS2, they rock!",5.0
I am glad that I had purchase this 128MB memory card. This was recommended to me here in Amazon by another gamer.,5.0
"I had no idea that PlayStation stopped 3rd party memory cards from working for the PlayStation slim, I just figured a memory card is a memory card. So I ordered it but it wouldn't work. I contacted the seller and told them it was defective and simply would not work. They were very kind and said that they would replace it. by this time I figured out that it wouldn't work for this PlayStation slim all together. So I asked for a refund ( not actually thinking they would give it to me, considering I had already open the package) and they gave me a full refund. It was very nice of them and they did not have to give me the refund but they did, and that's why I am giving them five stars, they are a great Amazon seller. But just remember, 3rd part memory cards do not work for the PlayStation 2 slim consoles! If you do have a slim then you might want to look for a memory card made by Sony. I also think Magic Gate memory cards work as well. They may cost a little more and you won't get nearly as big of one but you won't be wasting your money.",5.0
daughter still loves her play station needed a bigger memory card for a couple games so searched amazon and found this to order for her.,5.0
Cam quick and works like new.  It is everything that I expected it to be and plus it was cheap.,5.0
"A lot of times I think people only leave reviews on the complex items or when there are issues. Don't expect anything long in this review: the item was received promptly, works as described and no complaints. Nothing else to say.",5.0
"This memory card has unleashed my games from start, but don't stop gameplay to awe yeah, now let's get some lunch... Save! gameplay. Holds up well, saves and loads reliably, does what a card should do: Save my Games!!",5.0
"So I came across an old PS2 game at my parents while visiting, that for one reason or another, never made it back to my place (and thus was never played. For the record it was The Godfather game). When I returned home, I played it a bit before bed, then tried to save it- only to find the memory card  had was full (and no I wasn't willing to delete anything on it to make room). Here comes Amazon to the rescue! (with Prime 2 day deliveries, even), I decided to go the smart route, and for a few extra bucks, got the 128MB instead. Smart move. I kept the game on (and tv off) and sure enough, the next day the memory card arrived and I was able to save my game. Amazon, you are my personal gaming savior!",5.0
Now I have a memory card to hold all my games at last! Love it!! Best buy for sure!! Yippee!,5.0
this has huge memory for ps2 and is great because it can save a more than a few games and save you some money,5.0
Now I don't have to worry about deleting a save game file or replays anymore.  I can keep them all!!,5.0

I was weary of buying..But it works great. Would recommend it to any one. Great price and great value. No Problems,5.0

So far so good it saves the games that need to be saved.  I would buy another one if I had to.,5.0
PS2 Memory Card 128MB for Playstation 2.  This will help me keep from having so many memory cards nothing more annoying than having to get another card cause you filled yours up if there was only a way to have save states on this system:),5.0

"I find that this memory card indeed does it job quite well, so far I have not encountered any issues.",5.0

"I don't think this will replace all other memory cards, but it does work fine with my PS2 and I tried saving a few different games to tr it out.  They all worked.  I have the slimline PS2 so I don't know if that makes a difference with it working or not.  The price is right.  I don't think I will be saving any of my serious games on this card, but this is a great value for sure!  Also I got it shipped free because of a contract with Amazon, which is always real nice.",5.0
I had no problems like others had to do with their memory card this work as promise and was a great price compared to Sonys,5.0
"Quite simply, if you have a ps2 you need a memory card. The 128MB card should do the trick for any gamer.",5.0
"Just as the title suggests. Its a PS2 memory card. I plugged the thing in and it saves my game progress. Works as advertised, no complaints.",5.0

Card is fine. Works great. No glitches. Also holds a lot of memory and I also was able to transfer old stuff over to it.,5.0
"Got this to replace a 32MB card (normal cards are only 8MB); no ""driver disc,"" ""bank switcher disc"" or other hacks required; just shows up as 128MB of save game space.",5.0
"The PS2 memory cards are essential for a PlayStation 2 system.... particularly for the `Slim' models, which do not allow for the use of a hard drive and with 128 MB... more than enough storage space for games (and saves from starting over each time when playing games).  Great deal.",5.0
love it its nice and big. it is compact but large enough not to lose. easy to install into the slot,5.0
We bought this memory card to go in the playstation 2 since we only had a memory card for playstation 1. Was worried that since it wasn't an 8mb that it would be an issue to work in the playstation. The memory card works wonderful and it was well contained and shipped with care.,5.0
128MB will last you a while with the ps2. I play my ps2 everyday and even though I have been using the same memory card for over two years it still has 78MB left!,5.0
Got it and it works perfectly. Did not have to loosen to screws on the back to make it work. A great buy.,5.0
"JUST AS I ORDER IT, WORKING GREAT NO PROBLEMS I love it, GREAT NO PROBLEMS, NO PROBLEMS . JUST AS I ORDERED IT THANK U",5.0
"For a third party memory card, it does the trick for saving your favorite games. Instead of having piles of memory cards, you can now have just 1 to save a lot more save files. I'd recommend this to anyone that has had to either delete old save files or get another memory card to save more of their games.",5.0
"Usually the ps2 would recommend standard 8mb.. but wow 128mb, what an endless amount of space! I've already stored about 20 ps2 games with multiple saves! Best deal ever.",5.0
"I was very happy with this purchase. I recently acquired a PS2 from my father, along with a large quantity of games, and no memory card. It was cheep and it works fine. That is all that really matters, right? Another thing you might be curious about: No, it is not going to break easily. It is certainly built to last.",5.0
Great to deal with.  Got exactly what we ordered and in a very timely fashion.  Trustworthy vendor for ordering product.,5.0
These new memory cards work just as expected.  Plugged them in and have not had a problem with them in the 6 months of using them.,5.0

"Hello, i must say this card does just what it says, it holds all of my PS2 game saves, i have always wanted to use one ""Memory Card"" for all saves. The card holds 128MB and after saving all my saves i have 110MB left and i have well over 60 Playstation 2 games, it`s like having a ""PC Hard Drive"" in the PS2 and now that i know the card really do work, i will be ordering quite a few more before they are no longer in stock. It does not take much to make me happy and this makes me very happy, now i must get more PS2 games, i have 2 PS2, 2 PS3, 1 PSP, 1 Tablet, 2 Laptops and 2 Desktops all for gaming, i love gaming and proud to say i am a 56 year old gamer, started in 1992, love it.

"memory card works great, they lost their other one and would get frustrated they couldn't save the game, I purchased a used one and we are all happy with it.",5.0
"The memory card works perfectly and is a very great product. The 128MB was a great improvement from my 12MB and 8MB memory cards. I had grown tired of erasing my save data to get space for other games. So I was very happy to find this. Also the delivery was a lot faster than I expected, which was great since I had also bought a few games that required the space. Thanks for the great product and I look forward to seeing what else you have in the future.",5.0
"Lo recib hace cuatro das y estoy super contento, funciona excelente, tanto la consola como la tarjeta de memoria. Excelente resolucin, cero calentamiento. Lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados.",5.0
The 128mb memory card is good. I got it out of the pacage and it worked right away. I know that some people had to tighten the screws on the back but I didn't have to. Like I said the memery card is good but finiky. If I were you I would buy it. Now im buying one for my friend.,5.0
"This card is perfect and a great value. I can fit all of my games for the PS2 and more on it. It's a little longer than the old 8MB one which is fine, but it still fits into the video game cases in the memory card slot for easy transportation. It seems just as sturdy as the one I've had since the day the PS2 came out. This was a great upgrade and I'm happy with my purchase. I will never need another memory card for the PS2 again.",5.0
"I was a little apprehensive about buying this based on the reviews that it doesn't work for some, but I wanted to make sure I had enough storage without buying multiple cards.  I must say that this card has worked perfectly for me with no problems.",5.0
"This card is great! I also had a little trouble the first time I tried it, but once I loosened the screws slightly, it worked beautifully. I have most of the ""good"" PS2 games (around 60) and can confirm that this will work with all of them. This is definitely a great card at a great price! I would recommend that anyone with a PS2 go get one. You won't be disappointed!",5.0
"After reading all of the other reviews, I was a little discouraged. DON'T BE! This works beautifully. No problems whatsoever. Save money and space. Get this 128MB memory card instead of the crappy 8MB Sony one. I'm so happy I could cry!",5.0
The Last Memory Card the PS2 will ever need. Once you follow the suggestions posted to loosen the screws to get it to work right. After that its flawless.,5.0
I keep using it almost every time I play my ps2 games.,5.0
"Okay, lots of people have said this here so I'm repeating.

This card works. Period.

This card does have a problem however. Fortunately, it can be worked around.

This card is very tight, ergo, slightly smaller than the Sony card. Loosening the screws fixes this problem. Once you do this, the card will operate properly for the full 128MB that the card can hold. (Yes, I've actually filled it up with this many saves and things.)

If you are using homebrew programs that operate at boot time, you might run into another problem with this card. Because it has so much memory, the PS2 has trouble addressing it all immediately. It gets there, but these homebrew programs (FMCB, for instance) need faster access. If you are using some homebrew programs you will have problems when using this card. The best thing to do is to install homebrew on a standard, 8MB card, and to keep this larger card for other things that don't need to have full access at boot time, like your game saves.

Other than that it works perfectly! I haven't had any data corruption or other errors once getting the above sorted out after much trial and error. Highly recommended card.",5.0
"I purchased the ""New PlayStation 2 / PS2 128MB Memory Card"", and received it in three days through standard mail. I read the reviews listed on this page and took my chances with the purchase, and boy am I glad I did. I had no problems what so ever with the card, it performed perfectly with all aspects of my PS2. I am going to order three more of these memory cards and back up all of my games. I love this product!

I read some reviews here and saw to my horror this statement ""I reinsert it with the game on"". Aaaa, NEVER, NEVER, take out or reinsert the memory card from your game system while the power is on, NEVER! (Or anything else that is digital). That is 95% the reason these people are having problems with their game systems and/or their digital equipment. Also there are some reviews stating that these cards are not Sony's. They are, and as everyone knows even if they are manufactured by a third party, they have to meet Sony's standards and quality. (Copyright and counterfeiting laws are enforced by Sony)",5.0
"Holds all the memory you need, and Great quality and Great price, Mega Fun, So go get your game on,",5.0
"This cart is great if you have a ps2 and want to store all of your games in one place, however if you have a 60Gig ps3 it won't work with it.",5.0
"If you insert the card in your PS2 and it doesn't work, untighten the screws on the back of the card a bit. (there are 2). you will need a precision philips screwdriver.

Put the card into your PS2 and boom, it works! Someone else suggested this and it worked like a charm. Seems like they are tightened too much at the factory and in some way, it interrupts the memory on the card.

This card is great, holds a ton of memory, the most you'll need really. Haven't had a problem with it since. Fairly sturdy for what it is.",5.0
"To put it simply this card works for me. It works with all my games and all my old saves. I might also mention, all the games that report available memory on screen report the card size correctly.",5.0
This was my best choice for the price for a PS2 memory card. The product shipped quickly and well protected. It arrived in perfect condition and was installed like other 8MB memory cards. I did notice that to the playstation it appears as 16 eight MB cards which actually lets me organize my game data a little easier. I have not yet transferred any older data to it but I'm expecting good results when I do.,5.0

"It is fun to play this game, I really like it. No major complaint but if you have ps or xbox, there are several dance pads option, for tv you have only one or two but it is OK dance pad.",5.0
I for one am really happy with this product.  The graphics may not be fancy but the game works great and it even has pinball as well.  It's really a fun way to excersize and the kids LOVE it.  I was worried that with it being so inexpensive that the mat wouldn't be responsive enough but surprisingly it is quite sensitive.  My 4 year old can step on it lightly and it senses every step.,5.0

"I recieved this product in the mail today, and was able figured it out without ever trying anything like this before! It's so great to be able to just use the TV to work it! I feel like I've been to the gym after doing this for the past 30 min.! What a workout!!

  For those of you who gave this product bad comments, you might need more foot eye coordination! Anyone who is good with beats and has an ear for music you will have no problem! (It is tricky at first, but not impossible. Like I said, I'm writing this comment after my first 30 min. first time ever experience with this type of product.)

  I even think this product would be great if you have a blind sibling or friend. One could call out ""Front, Back, Left, Right."" The moves are the same on each song, so by playing one song over and over I bet they could get it eventually without anyone speaking to them!!

  Note: The songs that show one foot are the easiest, and the ones showing 5 feet are really tough. You MUST wait until the moving arrows are right smack on top of the stationary yellow arrows at the top to get it perfect. Make sure you listen to the song and move with the beat. Even tunes I never heard before don't seem to difficult to master if I listened to the beat and get a feel for the rythm.

  Have fun with this product!!!",5.0

"This is the very best playstation 3 headset. All others, including bluetooth headset for the ps3 are cheap and of low quality. I guarentee you will not get any headaches over this. Very comfortable and sounds so good, works with every damn game. Buy this i highly reccomend this.",5.0
"This is so much fun.  My children and I used to go the arcade at the local mall and the DDR machine was one of my personal favorites.  Then the arcade closed for good and I was missing my exercise. Besides, the game was usually already being played so I ended up waiting lots of times.

But this game is terrific and no waiting.  I can turn on my TV and play anytime.  I don't need a game console or any other expensive equipment.  Make sure you wear a pair of socks while playing so your feet don't stick to the pad and don't worry about the smell of the vinyl - it subsides.  A few pieces of duck tape folded so the a sticky surface is exposed on both sides took care of the pad moving on the floor.  I highly recommend this item.  Can't be beat for the price!",5.0
"This game is for sure not for anyone below the age of 16 but AO is just stupid! The PC vertion of this game has a mod you can optionaly download by some nerd in a basement that lets more explicet things into the game with arnt there originaly! This game should be rated M witch it sure is but if you are buying this it isn't as bad as everyone says, take a look.

- major limb tearing violence

- major drug referance/useage *you never actualy see any illegal drugs except in a mission where you have to burn down a marijana feild for a hippy from SF*

- beautiful, and very very good representation of LA, SF, and LV!

- 100's of cars that all are diffrent and drive diffrently!

- dozens of boats/air craft/ motorcycles!

- dozens of huge songs including Micheal Jackson, Guns N' Roses, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and many many others! for every type of music fan out there!

- MAJOR MAJOR gang violence activity thats no diffrent from GTA Vice Citys gang/mob violence but in SA its alot more in the wide open and more into the story line!

If you let your child or if you can take watching scarface you can play VC with out getting offended.

If you let you child watch boys in the hoob then you can take SA in without getting offended.

If you are one of those parents who think your child/friend will pick up some of the violence and language from a video game you do not really want your kid playing SA for its non stop violence and, a new ""feature"", to the game is a ton of explicet language so watch it!

Over all don't get this game if you are offended easy or if you don't like major violence and explicet language DO NOT even think about GTA

But, if you like cars, guns, music, and comedy/serious story line! this game is right down your ally!

I like this because I have multiple game consoles and a dvd player. This let's you hook up up to three game consoles or dvd players. As long as you buy this from a us store it works.

"When I received the unit, one of the RCA plugs had a broken connection.  I was just going to pass on the bad cord and use another as a substitute.  When I got the first notice from Amazon about rating my purchase, I noticed it said if there were any problems at all, to contact the seller.  I did, thinking that I would just get a blow-off from the company, saying that it was their supplier's fault.  I received a very nice email from a representative of the company saying that is was a rarity that incident had happened, but it did happen occasionally and would I be satisfied if they sent me a new one and not worry about returning the old one.  I was thinking they meant the cord...they meant the whole unit, A/B/C switch and all.  VERY, VERY satisfied with the co-operation I got from this company.",5.0

However, after I wrote the review, I received multiple emails and a phone call apologizing for the non-working cable, and an offer to send a new one.

"I just recently was forced to upgrade to a HDTV after my good old CRT tv of 10 years picture finally gave out. Well, I went to Best Buy, got a 51"" brand new HDTV without the added extended warranty and surge protecter that they try to force on you you. Anyway, I asked how many a/v inputs the tv had, and the salesman almost laughed at me saying it only had one and that it was ancient technology and I was better off upgrading everything to high defeniton. Ok, at 36 years old I'm a dinasour who still enjoys playing my original x-box, sega saturn, and even older 16-bit systems. This AV changer did the trick. Just plug in up to three of your ""ancient"" a/v cords to this and then plug it to the a/v input of your either very old  outdated tv or new state of the art HDTV and behold, yes, you han still play all of your older favorite games. It doesn't even need to be plugged in, Another + .",5.0
"We purchased the AV selector so that we could hook up a Roku box to access Netflix for streaming movies and t.v. shows. We have an older 36 inch t.v. that still works very well, so we didn't want to have to spend money on a new tv.  Our tv only has one a.v. adapter, making it impossible to hook up the cable box/DVR, Roku box and the DVD player all at the same time. The AV selector solved that problem.

By spending only $10.00 on the AV selector we are able to hook up all three devices to our T.V. We have been using it for about one month now. It works great, and you can't beat the price on Amazon.com.  We priced an AV Selector at Best Buy and it was $42.00. We worried about the quality of this one for $10.00, but we have had no problem. We would highly recommend this product.",5.0

I have the output send audio signal to my stereo, which is limited to one external aux input, and the video goes to my TV, which has only one external imput for RCA jacks.

"All my son's games come with a red, white and yellow cable to transmit the audio and visual aspects of video gaming. Unfortunately, most televisions have only one -rarely more- area that accepts all three cable connections, often called AV when flipping through the TV remote. This amazing gadget will connect each of the three cables of three separate gaming consoles, xBox, PS3 and Wi for example, then tie them into a single cable - which then easily fits into the three jacks at the back of the TV. This handy switch can be placed in front of the TV to give you easy access, no moving the tv to get remove one set of cables to play games from a different console. Solved all my problems!",5.0

"It's a great little audio/video switch.  It requires no power, has three inputs, and comes with a short RCA triple-cable for Video/Right/Left.  There is no crosstalk between the sources, which is what you want.  If you are looking for a manual switch, this one works great and is cheaper than the Sony that I also looked at.  If you want a remote control, this is not the switch for you, since you have to go over to it to change the input.",5.0
"It is a little awkward to place when  you plug everything in it - but I can live with it.  For $10 - this was a great buy for me.  It works, easy to use and not really all that space consuming.

Recommended for anyone who wants to be able to play multiple consoles without having to unplug everything everytime and who is also on a budget :)

...To add as of 5/3/2011...I have bought two of these (for two different areas) and have come to really love the simplicity of this as well as the continued performance.  It is sturdy, a great price, and something I still recommend for those on a budget :)",5.0

This simple AV selector is ideal for people using multiple game consoles (especially for TV's with only one RCA input).  The selector is practical and is a great value at $10.

"Works exactly as advertised. Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.",5.0
"I just received the extension cables recently and they so far seem to work great for the price. I haven't noticed any lag, or at least not anything significant for any but the most hardcore Smash players. I can't comment on the longevity, since I haven't had them for long.",5.0

"My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him, we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research, I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those, the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! After playing the game for a bit while being ""tethered"" to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller, we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom. So we got these controller extension cables. He is happy!",5.0

Great product! Now my kids don't need to sit right next to the TV to play their GameCube. I would buy these again.,5.0
I was very pleased with this product! It was exactly as described! The price is also very reasonable for this product!,5.0
I viewed these and others on Amazon and found several with a wide price range. I took these because they were cheap and thought I would give them a try and  if they weren't any good I hadn't lost much. They work great and the quality are as good as those of others I have seen.,5.0
"Two people sat in front of the couch, two people sat on the couch. The cord extenders went to the people sitting a little farther away, because unfortunately, gamecube controller cords are really short. These worked great though.",5.0
"This is a great product that works exactly as the product page states - it extends the reach of the gamecube controller cable by 6 feet. Seems sturdy, and the connection is nice and tight so it doesn't fall off by itself. Not detecting any latency between hitting the controls and actions happening in-game.",5.0
"These awesome-sauce things make any GC controller as far extended as a wavebird. Given these days any games I have time to play are all via the Wii anyway, having the extra length for GC controllers is great.",5.0
"With the amount of interference I kept getting with the wireless controllers, I was stuck far too close to the TV to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics. This cable extension cord made playing some of my old Gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out. A big must have if you can't get the wireless format to work properly.",5.0
The cords make it easy for me to use my game cube controllers while on the couch and leaving my wii in place. I unplug everything and put it away each time I finish using it. The cords have not worn out and still work like new.,5.0
this really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we needed,5.0
"When the gamecube came out, we all had 19, 20 or 24 inch CRT televisions.  The standard 6 foot gamecube controller cord was acceptable.  But now that we have these 50+ inch TV screens, 6 feet just doesn't cut it.

I've used 2 of these cables for about 6 months to play games on my gamecube and wii.  Everyday I wrap the cords back up around the controller and tuck it away.  All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack.

I'd recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV.  Their ""may"" be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games, but I couldn't beat the price.  I didn't bother even looking for an alternative.",5.0
"Easy to use, fantastic to play across the room or what have you. Price is fantastic! Shipped perfectly on time.",5.0
"I rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations. Also, I would recommend this product to others.",5.0
"The gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying. Once got these that solved that problem. They work great, fit right, and do not cause any controller lag. Great buy.",5.0
This was very helpful in getting the dance pads further way from the Wii to be able to play with our projector.  Totally recommend this product and dealer!,5.0
I can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the TV. There are no problems.,5.0
With this older non IR system I need to extend the controller with a reasonable item. This fit the bill with no problems.,5.0
"These are fantastic. A much cheaper option than picking up wireless controllers to play Gamecube/Virtual console on your Wii. These cords make it so our controllers span almost the entire width of the room that they're in. Haven't tried daisy chaining them together, but you could make a comically long 18' controller that way.",5.0
"I got my Extension cables earlier this year and have absolutely ZERO problems with them.  I am impressed with the quality of the cables.  Looking through others posts some complain of bad quality and parts, mine are great.  I got mine from the seller Agile mobile LLC, which when I click on the seller profile turns into amermedia.",5.0
"This is the greatest thing for wired controllers.  Our game system is in one location, and these extension cables make is a whole lot easier to sit comfortably without being right on top of the television.  They are currently unavailable at the moment, however when more come in, will definately purchase another set.  My daughter and her friends are thrilled.",5.0
"These extenders work as expected. I bought them when I wanted to buy Double Dash for the game cube to play on my Wii. If you're used to playing the Wii, you probably sit much further away than a standard GC controller will reach, so definitely pick some of these up.",5.0
"I hate using wireless controllers.  These allow me to sit on my couch comfortably and use my wired controllers, rumble and all.  They are a little hard to get undone, but I leave them connected nearly all the time.  The price makes these a great deal.  I recommend them to all my friends with gamecubes.",5.0
"fast shipping, great price! bought 2 packs and it really makes gaming easier since we can finally sit on the couch with our gamepad controllers.",5.0
"This is a must get for anyone who has a gamecube or uses the backwards compatibility of their wii to play their favorite old games. With 6 ft being enough length for just one controller, you can give the other to a friend, or have it connected to a second controller. And only $4? Worth every penny.",5.0
"At 6 feet and at 4 dollars each its a good deal, ive seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine, i like that they're black  and they connect into the controller with ease. buy it with confidence.",5.0
The product was just as the picture and works fine.  It is long enough to play comfortably at a distance.  There is no delay in control using this product.,5.0
"The extensions connect perfectly and the connection is flawless. It seems as if the controller is wireless because it extends so far. A great price for a great buy. If you love GameCube and need an extension for your wired controllers, these are the ones to get.",5.0
"This isn't a particularly deep product. They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers. They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price. They extend approximately 6 feet in length, and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already, these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room. I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller. Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers. I'm on a budget so I'll just stick with a wired controller, no big deal.",5.0
"these things are a must. the gamecube controllers are too short.  not much to say about these cords themselves, other than they work.",5.0
"Not much to screw up here. Six foot cables extend the length of your gamecube controller by...six feet.  No mere empty cords are these, no way, they transmit controller input straight to the 'cube and everything! You heard me right sir or madam! Sit your fatty posterior in your couch and hammer those thumbs and fingers till they fall off! These cables work something swell! BUT DO NOT EAT!",5.0
I bought this for my gamecube contoller to plug into my wifes wii. It as more than enough to allow comfort and ease of the controller.,5.0
"-Both 6ft (I think they're 6ft) cords work well.

-When plugging into the female end of the extension cord, it has a very noticeable snugness. It could be a good thing or a bad thing.

-Both cords smell new. lol

-Great value if more than one extension cord is needed.",5.0
"I play Brawl and Melee all the time with my siblings and friends, and sitting squished together 3 feet from the tv was a pain. So I got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this, even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews. but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all. I expected there to be lag with the controls, but there wasn't. They have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in top-notch condition. These are great if you need room or do not like sitting 3 feet from the screen.",5.0
"These do exactly what they are supposed to do. So now I cam sit back and enjoy the games, there is no delay interference with any moves. It works seamlessly, and great price too.",5.0
"When I saw it said ""2x"" I thought it meant the length of the standard 6' remote was doubled, and only 1 6' cable would be included. It actually means 2 of the cables are included, making the Gamecube remote 18 FEET LONG. Far more than what I needed, but at least I know under no circumstances will the remote not be long enough.

Also, the cables function perfectly. Absolutely no problems. Highly recommended.",5.0
This item far exceeded our expectations.  The cord length is far longer than we expected.  This will allow us to play the game cube games from the couch without having to pull the console out of the entertainment center.  The cords seem to be very good quality and I am very happy with this product.,5.0
"bought this on amazon for 7 something $.  later found it was much cheaper elsewhere on amazon/ebay...
otherwise, good quality.",5.0
"I always hated how Gamecube controller's cords were so ridiculously short. Since I use them on my Wii now, it is much more hazardous for my Wii if someone trips over the short cables. This was a perfect solution to my problems. So far I haven't had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit 6 ft away from the Wii. Another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cable.",5.0
I chose this over a wireless controller because I don't have to worry about command delays. The standard controller cord isn't long enough to sit far back enough with larger televisions. Works perfect.,5.0
They're awesome cables though!  They work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack.  Now I can play my Gamecube games on my Wii from the couch!  No batteries to change!,5.0
I bought 2 sets of this product (so 4 cables total). I was not disappointed. They all work perfectly and they accomplished what I bought them for. I have 2 big screen TV's and the 2 rooms I use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach. Hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved. I also like the length because I still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and don't pay attention to the cords. They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games.,5.0
These are great cords to have for the Wii or Gamecube.  It's nice to be able to sit with your controllers nice and far away from the TV.,5.0
"i bought the 2 x Wii Gamecube GC Extension Cable Cord  but after a few uses, it started working wrong, duplicating signals

if i press A in the controller, the game detects A being pressed two times, this is for all buttons,  without the cord the error is no longer there.",5.0
The package came with two extension cords that are about the length of the cords for the gamecube controllers. Overall I am satisfied with the product.,5.0
"I purchased two sets because we needed these cables in a permanent installation to facilitate three side-by-side DDR dance pads in a projected image Wii setup.  They serve the purpose well, were reasonably priced, arrived quickly and seem to be good quality.  I wholeheartedly recommend them.",5.0
Cords were delivered promptly and worked exactly as they're supposed to.  I've had these for about a year now and have had no problems at all.,5.0
I ordered these items because we have a rather larger living room and the kids were getting excited so much they were pulling the Nintendo onto the floor. This was a great solution. Thanks,5.0
Came quick and works great for added length for Wii Hottest Dance party dance pads.,5.0

I bought the cord along with the Outdoor Sports Challenge for Wii.  I wasn't sure I would need it, but I knew the mat for this game was going to be about 15 feet from the TV, so I wanted to be safe.  Turns out I was right.  The cord for the mat was much too short to reach my TV.  The cord works great.  It plugs right into the side of the Wii.  Great buy for anyone using the Wii games with mats (including DDR).",5.0

"I got this game when it first came out. The gameplay and graphics were great at the time. Random taunts and insults were funny and still are.

"We were really looking forward to this sequil, after having so thoroughly enjoyed Myst.  We were not disappointed.  The kids are enjoying it now.",5.0
"this game was a giant step up from myst.  myst was great and all but riven was 5 times harder and more complex.  it took my sister and i a while to beat.  but it was worth it.  we did it all using only 2 small hints from the book and one, at the very end, made me feel really stupid that i hadnt thought of it before.  the graphics are great and the story relates back to myst a little bit.  some things like journals and such are still here and even though its a bit of a pain to read it all, its worth it.  there were actually a few people and that was cool.  the puzzles were great.  not impossible but some were close.  it kept me busy for a while.  but it was hard not to keep playing all night.  it was frustratingand intriging at the same time.  i highly recommend it.  switching disks got annoying after a while but the rides were cool the first time through.  id just turn out the lights and end up swaying with the movements.  it just sort of took me into its world, even more so than myst.  this was my favorite after playing all three.  though exile was good too, it was a lot easier than riven and a lot shorter, dealing more with the graphics and story and video than the actual puzzles and fun.  not to sayy that riven didn't do that.  the puzzles just seemed to be better.  and if you ever got stuck on one place, you could take a break from it and try to solve the puzzles on a different island.  overall, a great game.  id buy it again.  replay value isn't that great since you remember exactly what to do the 2nd time through because it took you so long the first time.  but im keeping it and ill replay it in another year or so when ive forgotten it.  it keeps the mind sharp and the senses acute.  watch out for those little subtle clues!",5.0
"this game looks great on all the trailers i found, and even though i never had a chance to bye or play it, i recon ill always search for where to get it.",5.0
"Ironman, Doctor Doom and Magneto, in one game, all 3 playable(doom you need a code for, but still), both awesome.

sure, this option is also availabe in the newest installment to the X-Men Legends series(Magneto and Ironman).  but in order to get Tony Stark you have to make it four fifths of the way through the game until you can play as him.

this game is, without a doubt, a classic among the 2D fighters.  even up there with the first two Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II.

why they bothered with Psylocke, i'll never know.  they could have put, say, Sabretooth in...or even Thor.",5.0
"I still remember when I first bought this game back in 1997.  It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed.
The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2.
The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them.
On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter.
I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.",5.0
I bought this game and I thought this game was so cool.  The characters are so detailed and the selection is not bad.  It has everyone that is mostly liked.  Captain America is the best in the Marvel Universe and in this game.,5.0
"Marvel Super Heroes, Capcom and Marvel's 1995 follow-up to 1994's X-men: Children of the Atom, is basically another clone of their groundbreaking Street Fighter II fighting engine.  Overall a bunch of elements come together with this game to make a fun and enjoyable ""beat `em up"" game.
THE FIGHTING ENGINE:
Again, this is basically another ""Street Fighter"" clone, with different characters, etc.  The reliable Street Fighter engine, while repetitive is still fun.  The game level difficulty is ""just right.""  It's easy to beat the game but still SOMEWHAT challenging but at the same time not difficult to the point where it frustrates.  Like a good Street Fighter clone, combatants can duke it out as well toss a fireballs and beams and other assorted weapons at each other.
THE STORY:
Marvel Super Heroes' game storyline is roughly based upon the Marvel Comics ""Infinity Gems/Infinity War"" storyline where 10 of Earth's greatest heroes (and villains) seek to recover (or steal) the all-powerful Infinity Gems from the Evil Thanos of Titan, who is bent on destroying the universe with their power.
THE FIGHTERS:
You can choose from these following Marvel Super Heroes (and Villains):
1. Wolverine (of X-men fame)
2. Spider-Man (of Spider-Man fame)
3. The Incredible Hulk (of Hulk fame)
4. Captain America (of Avengers fame)
5. Iron Man (ditto)
6. Psylocke (from X-men)
7. Shuma-Gorath (noted Marvel Universe villain)
8. Blackheart (ditto)
9. Juggernaut (of X-men fame)
10. Magneto (ditto)
GAME MODES:
This is a straight-forward game with two modes:  Arcade (you vs. the computer for 8 battles) and Vs. (you vs. a friend).
WHAT SETS THIS GAME APART:
The one thing that DOES set this game apart from its ""Street Fighter"" clone brethren is the integration of the Infinity Gems into actual game play.  Through each fight stage (8 altogether) your character fights to recover a single Infinity Gem from each opponent.  The gems can be used in each fight to ""power-up"" your fighter.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, though this game is dated, it is still quite fun.  If you're into Marvel comics you'll enjoy the storyline as well as the action of the game.  The Marvel/Capcom line did evolve from here with 4 other releases (with more on the way) including:  X-men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and the Marvel vs. Capcom series of games.
In all though, this game is still worth the playtime.
Highly Recommended",5.0

"Forsaken 64 is one of those games that you never heard of and play it anyways and you find it to be an awesome game. The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you. Overall, the game is great and is a definite buy for every N64 fan!",5.0

"Megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation. However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.

Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.

The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.

As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game",5.0

Legends is one of the rare Megaman releases that takes place in a 3D world as opposed to the traditional 2D side scroller most MM fans are familiar with. Both Legends and Legends 2 are among some of the best made story driven 3D adventure games the PSX has in its massive and sometimes daunting library.,5.0

"This was my first action RPG and its the best basically if your an older player like me, 23, may not hold up  graphically today but it is a very fun and expansive game for its time.",5.0
"In the age of console progression from 2D graphics to a 3D world, so many developers and game series had trouble adapting to the drastic changes that took place - scenery required more in-depth thought than simple textures and scrolling backgrounds, and on a metaphorical level the character that a player controlled was no longer as detached emotionally; with the advent of 3D movement came a closer ""bond"" between the gamer and his character, a feeling that you weren't just controlling a protagonist, but working WITH him to accomplish what was done. In that respect, few companies truly managed to capture that essence in the games that graced consoles such as the Playstation (although many, such as Final Fantasy, more than proved their worth in storyline alone).

Not so with Megaman Legends.

Normally one would be worried about the substantial track that Legends takes off the main path compared to the other series - Megaman ""Rock"" Volnutt's origins are far from related to the events of the original series, he doesn't ever obtain the ability to copy an enemy's powers (although this is made up for with a large list of Special Weapons), and even ""Wily"" is reduced to an octogenarian boat shop owner. Yet it is precisely this fact that makes the game so enjoyable to both veterans and new players; the former will find within the game's content the same ""Blue Boy"" persona they've known, albeit with even more backstory and characterization, and the latter can jump into this game without needing to worry about prior knowledge or information.

The story, although relatively quick and straightforward, is still consistent enough in its endeavors that it's hard to find a reason to be bored - when you're not chasing down henchmen of the pirates as they storm the city's center, you're likely to be facing off against some giant Reaverbot or even simply exploring the eerie, isolated Sub-Ruins that dominate the island. And, oh, does the scenery attribute to this - no matter where you happen to go the environment and its sound effects are sure to match your situation beautifully. In the city, peppy uptown music jingles as polygonal cars drive the streets; in the underground ruins, the music changes to a solemn and eerily 'lacking' tune with only the occasional clank or grind, allowing you to focus entirely on the soft sounds of Reaverbot movements coming from all directions - it is the little details like this that help make the experience so memorable (if you don't believe me, try exploring the Clozer Woods Ruins alone in a dark room at night).

Megaman's primary weapon is of course his famous Buster gun, but the game goes about improving it in a rather interesting manner: Buster Parts. Rather than simply obtaining permanent upgrades over the course of the game, Megaman can instead collect a large variety of different attachments that increase the power of his shots, how rapidly he fires them, how far they can reach, or how many he can shoot before he must ""pause"" briefly to recharge, or any combination of the four. Thus, the player is invited to create and edit their own ""build"" to suit their needs based on the situation. Is the enemy close up but taking too long to defeat? Sacrifice some range to buff up your attack. Or perhaps they're just out of reach? Take away a little bit of your firing capacity to stretch out the range that little bit farther. The fact that there's no combination that provides a max-out of every stat (save for a particular item on Easy Mode) means that the necessity for these kind of choices is always apparent, and this further encourages experimentation and practice in a game that already involves the player so much.

However, Megaman also has some support in his efforts against the Reaverbots, in the form of Special Weapons. Ranging from explosive mines to homing missiles (and even a laser!), the options our blue-clad hero has to choose from to accompany him on his adventures remain as variable as ever. However, there is an important catch - he has to find them first. Each of the Special Weapons must either be obtained through a storyline event or by combining several different pieces together, most of which are found only through exploring the extensive caverns of the Sub-Ruins. Yet even after finally acquiring these instruments of power, there's still more that can be done - each Special Weapon has its own set of areas that can be powered up (such as attack power, ammo amount, or even a special ability). While these improvements can range from cheap to wholly expensive in cost (and thus might illicit in some a feeling of boredom from repetition of money farming), these improvements are entirely optional and absolutely none of them are required in order to finish the story, meaning the amount of time spent on them is left completely up to the player.

Perhaps what is by far the most appreciated aspect of this game, and most certainly appreciated by myself, however, is the voice acting. In a time where very few console games provided a substantial amount of voiceover work and even fewer did so WELL, Megaman Legends stands as a huge testament to just how much a great performance can enhance a character or the game experience overall. I can guarantee you any person who has played Megaman Legends beyond the first hour of gameplay will recall one or more lines spoken by the infamous Bonne family, from Tiesel's ""I TOLD you....CLOSE the HATCH!!!"" to Tron's infamous ""It's a dog!"" scene, or even just the adorable piping voices of the many Servbots. This is not limited to antagonists, however; Megaman himself is graced with one of the most fitting voices I have ever heard for his personality, and the Casket family themselves are far from monotonous. Yet despite all this character, the actual vocal performance is so spot-on that it's hard to not find yourself growing attached to both good and bad guy alike; lines are so well delivered and emotion so well conveyed, and both occur so often, that the game jumps to life long before the timeline of events becomes intense, and the clearer audio quality provided by the Playstation version of the game (which was lowered down for the port to the Nintendo 64) means that you get to hear these conversations in strikingly clear fashion.

If you are simply looking to kill some time and relax, this game can provide that - videos and evidence exist of players breezing through the game's story in anywhere from 1 to 3 hours (depending on difficulty level), and Easy mode, once unlocked, is literally the definition of ""an absolute blast"" for those who aren't looking to work too hard. If you want to spend longer, however, the Legends can provide that too - between the numerous sidequests and the SUBSTANTIAL number of upgrades one can make to the Special Weapons (only after you find the parts to make them, of course!), one could quite possibly spend more time on the sub-events than they do on the actual story - and yet, it is all still so immersive.

If you are already the owner of this unique and memorable installment in the Megaman timeline, I hope that you continue to enjoy its nuances even if it's a been a long time since you played it. If you're new to the series or haven't played this game, however, I honestly implore you to pick up a controller and give this a try. Though one can fully admit there are games out there with more intense fights and gameplay than what Legends presents, few can match the sheer memorability and ingenuity that surrounds so many aspects of this work from Capcom. Whether a Christmas present for a nostalgic or a blast from the past for yourself, Megaman Legends can really do nothing but good for the individual who allows the island of Kattelox to come into their life; though the light from Volnutt's Buster wasn't around for very long, it continues to shine in the hearts of so many still today.",5.0
"This game is amazing and anyone that calls themselves a megaman fan should most definitly buy it. It takes a very different approach to gameplay in comparison to the original megaman and megaman X games. It is more of a adventure/RPG type game somewhat similar to the setup of Nintendos Zelda games. In my opinion out of all the megaman games this one has the best story line, probably due to its humorous tenacity. This game is rather childish however, and I would not suggest that anyone who can't block this out should buy it.",5.0
"I already own this game but it's in terrible condition. This is due to me lending it out, which is something I certainly don't do anymore.

"We got ahold of an old copy of this game at our marching band camp, and it almost made us wish we hadn't. Putting super combo mode on, we commenced the 10 round tournament, that means each person plays until loses each round, with seven people in it. I came in second past the Senior Veteran, with a close match of 2-3. But then we looked at our hands. The fingernails had cut so deeply into the thumbs on our hands that blood stained the controller. We all had dime-sized blisters halfway through the week. So what did we do? Tape 'em up and kept playing! It took weeks for me to recover from the damage, because the pressure was non-stop. This was the most fun I'd ever had, and if you have a group of friends, I HIGHLY recommend this game, but bring some electrical tape. You'll need it.",5.0
"If you find Street Fighter Alpha 3 overwhelming, then you should try Street Fighter Alpha 2.  18 characters containing some of the most popular characters from the series: Ryu, Ken, Dan, Chun-Li (has her Kikoken fireball, but not her Spinning Bird Kick), Akuma, Sakura, Zangief, Dhalsim, Sagat, and he-plays-just-like-Guile Charlie.  Each character has his/her own ending.
You don't need to worry about what strength to use when using super combos, because each one takes only one ""power"" bar.  Great soundtrack, if you played Puzzle Fighter, then some of the music should be familiar to you.  Graphics are great, taunts are outstanding, and game control is excellent.  If you have a chance, grab this classic.",5.0
"Not only is Mega Man Legends the best Mega Man game, it (along with it's sequel) is THE best videogame ever created. I experienced unfathomable ecstacy playing this game in my youth.

A very emotion inspiring game. It will live in my heart and mind for the rest of my life. I can't possibly say enough about how much I love this game. It is just that good.",5.0

One thing though if your used to todays graphics these graphics aren't too great compared to todays but that makes it a little more fun I think since they're almost all robots.  It is in 3-D though.

You can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want. A great title for the ps.",5.0
"Well to start, this is a PS1 game so no one should be expecting some crazy detailed 360 graphics game from this. That being the case it carries the pixelated look of this generation of game. So any who says the graphics for the game suck are simply setting teh bar too high. Like I said, this is an old game so it should be treated as such.

Game play over all is quite fun and the aircraft selection isn't the worst in the world either. The Game play is a lot of fun in my opinion. It's great for any one that likes flight sim action games. Though it might not be recommended to any hard core flight sim PC gamers. The controls are simple enough that most people should have no trouble playing, but still also advanced enough that the aircraft responds in a relatively realistic manner. Though I must say, that the aircraft stall at low speeds really easily compared to later PS2 installments of Ace Combat.

This is a fun game to play and still carries some similarities to the story of the original Ace Combat, which is also known as Air Combat. The story isn't epic, but it's not too bad either. I enjoyed playing the game a and will continue to play is along with all the other Ace Combat games that I have.",5.0
"There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies. And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2...

If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.

The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear ""Bingo!"" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.

In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.",5.0
I've played Ace Combat 1-4 and I still think that this one is the best that I  have played. Many of the missions are pretty easy but thats just me. The games graphics are better than Air combat but are about the same as Ace Combat 3. The selection of planes is  pretty good but Namco could have done a better job but its still a great game.  Anyone that likes flight simulations should buy this game ASAP.,5.0

"This game is a classic, I first played it at the arcade around 1996, but the game came out around 94-95. Of course, you won't find beautiful visuals, this is piece of history, one of the first 3D fighting games ever created. It was groundbreaking for it's time, and to this day I still find it addictive.
Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.

EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET, MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CAN'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS!

"This game pretty much kicks ....  I know a lot about tekken games, and this is no different.  This is the beginning of a 5 game series, so far.  The graphics aren't good, but they are just what to expect from a 95 ps one game.  As tekken goes this is probably the worst, but still good.  As they make more they get better, but what kept me coming back for more was the story, not just the fighting.  As the game progresses, so does the story.  I own tekken 3,4 and soon 1,2 and between all those their's a tag game with all the characters to that point, tekken 3.  In tag tournament you get to play all the characters even if they died in previous tekkens.  Unlike all the tekkens so far you have a tag partner, it's pretty cool.  To skip to the point, you should buy this.  It's not the best one but you should buy it.  My personal favorites so far are 3,4.  Tekken tag and tekken 4 are for ps2, the rest are ps one.  None of the games are too expensive, especially 3, if you're good you can get all 5 for just 100 bucks.  They're worth a shot.
  Peace out

"Breath of Fire III's old-school graphics capture the feel of old RPGs, and how good they were, playing on NES and Super NES, back in the old days. Now  I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of  Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed  the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other  members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful  music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of  all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system. Definitely  get this if you're a fan of Capcom RPGs.",5.0

"I remember first playing this game at an early age in the late '90s. I received it at a Christmas gift in 2002 and have been playing it over and over again ever since. I love the soundtrack, I love the characters, I love the storyline, I love the dragon/accension system, I enjoy the idea of having masters teach you skills, or learning skills from enemies, and I for sure enjoyed the boss fights! This is my favorite RPG game of all time, and one of my favorite childhood memories. I think the graphics are awesome, for being made in 1998! The characters and locations in the game are beautifully drawn in my opinion. There are plenty of people that aren't fans of the music, but I think the soundtrack rocks! This game is amazing, and completely worth every penny!",5.0

"This was wonderful service. I ordered the game and it arrived within one week. (I'M EVEN STATIONED IN JAPAN!!!!!) and I received it very fast. The game was used, but it was almost in perfect condition. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. The only reason i'm not doing 5 out of 5 is because it didn't come with a manual, but thats ok.",5.0
"I originally bought this game when it first came out back in 97, but as things go i got a PS2 n got rid of all of my PS stuff. I fell in love with the game from the second i started playing it. So while browsing some PS games I came across the game and had to re-acquire it. Luckily my brother still had his old PS console. I'll say this, anyone who has not played this game before should get it & play it fully. Enjoy the fishing, the fairy village, the different ""Masters"", and the storyline itself.",5.0
this game is alot of fun you can somewhat customize your characters and tinker with thier stats and magic/skills the game is pretty long for 1 disk game but it also had a couple puzzles that makes you want to throw your remote at the tv lol all in all its all worth the hassle.,5.0
"This is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite, video game.  I've played it all the way through three times.

The battles are you typical, turn based battles, which I like.  The camera view is not the least bit confusing or difficult to follow.  The storyline is incredibly interesting, and keeps you in the story where you're playing it as much to find out what happens next as you are for the fun of it.

The side games, fishing and such, are enjoyable, and you get helpful items from them.

The characters are likable, and that's a bit plus in my book when it comes to video games.",5.0
"Hands Down, my favorite video game. I first played nearly 10 years ago, when I was 9 years old, I was at a relatives friends house, and he let me play. I am so glad he did, When I was about 10 or 11 I had been looking for this game forever, when I found it in a discount bin at Walmart (THE FOOLS!) Of Course, this was before it became a sought after gem. I have still never finished it! Ha, but I pretty much know what happens. Funny story (I'm boring you all...) My first save file which was about 75% done, was lost along with the memory card it was on when my brother borrowed my ps1. After a heartbroken couple of years of being stubborn, I started a new game...which I accidently overwrote while saving my girlfriends game for her. I was at the same exact point as my first game. A little over a year ago I started a new game. I'm not sure I want to finish. lol. (btw, I don't just suck that much, I just go a bit slow at every game I play. Plus I tend to stop playing a game, and pick it back up months later. I figure I don't have to start over to get the full effect of the story, since I basically know it inside out.)Sorry, I'll talk about the actual game now.
--ACTUAL GAME REVIEW BEGING HERE--
Breath of Fire III is AMAZING. The Story is so captivating and 3 dimentional. I think it really pulls off modern japanese storytelling and places it in a mostly western inspired setting. The story is really beautiful, Breath of Fire and Legend Of Zelda are what made me see video games as works of fiction alongside books and films, rather than just mindless entertainment with a story thrown together.
I think the graphics are perfect, they did what they wanted to do with it, and produced in my opinion what people would want to see. 2D in a three dimentional world, Not 2D like the 16bit graphics of BoF2, and while in a 3-dimentional world, there were no unsightly polygons that bosses and some characters were rendered in in BoF4, as well as what made up so many whole games of the time, such as Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario 64, and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While the latter two, are in my opinion, brilliant games (not that the first two are particualarly bad), the graphics were undeniably a little attrocious. I don't think any 3D game on the n64 or Playstation looked good, and while some of the best video games of all time were made in this period, and I wouldn't change a thing, I still think I would have waited for the capabilities of the gamecube, PS2, or X-box to make a game like that. Anyway, back to BoF3, I think this game triumphed in the graphics depatment because it had the technology for 3d landscapes and movement, but used 2D sprites and backgrounds, which could be ued at a far more sophisticated level than on a 16 bit console.
Gameplay is great. I'm not very good at describing that, but yeah, I think it has a great battle engine or whatever. (I'm kind of tired from writing about the graphics lol). I'm rather fond of the upper world map (which is less of a map, and more of a simply simplified world), versus the actual areas. The three quarters view is a bit strange, but I love it, probably better than it it were just front facing for some reason....Don't really have much to say about that...sorry.
Now, the most underrated part of this game, the music. I LOVE the music. Akari Kaida and Yoshino Aoki, they have done beautifully. I listen to this on my mp3 player. Everyone says it was the worst part of the game, but seriously, I think it is the best video game music ever. I love the opening and prolougue tracks especially, and the tracks For the Dragons (which I believe is the BGM for Dragnier) and Ending. The credits song Pure Again is lovely as well.
If you like RPGs, this is a must have. Probably one of the best video games of all time. So damn underrated.",5.0
I love this game. Changing into dragons is awesome and some of the characters are to die for (Like Rei and Ryu). The story really pulls you into the character and even the graphics aren't that bad. they're better than most PS one games ^_^ I suggest getting your hands on it if you like classic playstation games.,5.0
"This game is still a great RPG game even though it was released in the late 90s ('98?).  I'm a seasoned RPG enthusiast, but I never had a chance to play any of the BOF series so I decided to order this game on amazon about a month ago.  So far, I've played over 50 hours of this game (I think I'm almost finished!) and I can say that this game is as good (if not, better) than some of the BEST RPGs that ever existed, Final Fantasy and Zelda series included.

Stuff that I really like about this game:

* Story seems mysterious enough to keep your attention to what's gonna happen next.  It's about Ryu, the dragon boy and a mission to find out how/why he became a dragon and where he's from.

* Very interesting characters you'll meet like Rei, Ryu's partner who can transform himself into a tiger. There's also Nina who was a kidnapped princess who ended up travelling with Ryu.  There's Garr, a monster-bull looking thing that was supposed to hate Ryu's race, but ended up befriending Ryu.  And there's also Peco, a mutated vegetable-looking thing that ended up with the gang.

* Fairy village that you can ""customize"" that will sell you items/weapons and/or build your village by giving jobs to fairies, and you can even allocate a fairy to find items for you.  With your good (or bad) management, fairies can be born or die...

* Lots of little ""minigames"", puzzles, or mini-strategy quests that move the game along and keep it from getting boring.  For example, you have to find items to create a dish to feed a mayor of a town (don't ask!), or you have to control a crane and move boxes around to create a bridge to proceed to the next door, or pull a box with another person rhythmically to find an ""item"" awashed on the shore, etc.

* you can learn monsters spells/skills through the ""examine"" feature while fighting them.  It's a great addition, especially if you want to learn a very good skill that some monsters use.  Not all skills can be learned, though.

* you can find different types of people that can enhance your stats/skills by going under their apprenticeship.  For example, one of them can help you gain more power or defense, while another may make you more intelligent, etc.

So far, I have no complaints except for the ""desert quest"" that seemed to go on and on and on...you get the point.  But, like anything, it requires strategy and it's not as hard as some people think it is once you find out that there is an easier way to finish it.

Overrall, this game exceeds my expectation for a very good RPG game.  It's hard enough that it will keep you thinking of ways to proceed to the next level, but not too hard that it'll make you just quit it.",5.0
"First, I'd like to start out by saying, this is one of the best games I have ever played! Second, don't listen to anyone that gave this game 1 or 2 stars, because this game isn't as low as to get a poor rating. The main character, Ryu, is one of the dragons. The dragons, can take on a human-like appearance, but a little different (Example: Ryu from BOF 1 had fangs). The plot starts when Ryu is looking for 2 of his friends, who all got separated due to an accident. But later, the plot completely turns around and blocks off the 2 friends. But anyway, this game is REALLY FUN!!! The battle system is turn-based, and you can learn certain abilitis from enimies by using the ""Examine"" command. There are a total of 6 party memebers, and there only one thing I hate about this game. I like it when you can access to all of your party members in the menu, and that they all would get experience points (Like BOF 4). But I HIGHLY recdomend this game, and trust me, you won't regret buying it.",5.0
"Wow this game was awsome. i play many many rpgs including the final fantsy's and this game takes the cake. this game combines the mission adventure types with the leveling of a true rpg. Ryu is an orphan who is also a dragon, found by 2 mischievious outcasts and raised to help them. what i like about this game is that once ryu masters his dragon powers, he can find orbs that change him into different types of dragons, and if that wasn't enough, he can mix the orbs to become a stronger dragon. then adding to this game is the skills and master system. each character can learn skills and magic from monsters and on his/her own. And if u want unique skills/magic you can be trained by a master to learn new ones. and then just for good measuer, they put in time change, where in ruy turns into a dragon for 7 years pass. and some of the things u did in the past will help your future, ie. saving a princess gets you her help in the future. There are eventually 7 playable characters with each their own unique abilities. Oh 1 more thing, fishing is very important for best weapons and armor, mainly ryu so do not sell any of your fishing equiptment. I must have spent 150 hours on the game sidequests and all and im still not done. so take my word for it and buy this game.",5.0
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this game rocks its the best rpg ive ever played so far and trust me ive played a lot of rpgs. It goes with my top 3 list BOF3, Final Fansty 7, and Final Fansty 9. You should buy this game or rent it first but youve gotta play it. (to tell you the truth i never bought it i got it from a trade) u know what iam going to stop talking and go play it now iam a Mommo's Tower at the time.

"Breath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought.  I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.  Fun doesn't begin to describe it.",5.0
"Many may disregard the Breath of Fire series as just another RPG but Capcom has done a beutiful Job with this title.  They pulled out a lot on this case.  Beutiful 2D graphics that only Capcom can do, good music, simple controls make this an excellent purchase.  Chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so I say go for it.",5.0
"""Breath of Fire 3"" is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good, and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older ""Breath of Fire"" is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character, and then later in the game, you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre.",5.0
"Ok, you read my title and you're thinking ""He can't be serious!"" Well, I am. This game is just simply fantastic. Everything about it. The story is great, the anime style graphics are a good touch, the music is beatiful, and to top it all off, they left in the original Japanese voices instead of replacing them with bad English dubs! Way to go Capcom! Anyway this game is pretty much your standard, traditional rpg, which is one reason I like it so much. Most rpgs today, just don't interest me. I now find myself playing alot of fighting games, something I never did like, and actually enjoying them just because of lack of rpgs. I also have to admit that I a fan of the whole Breath Of Fire Series. They are all enjoyable to play and never get boring. I still find myself occasionally digging out my SNES and playing BOF I or II. That is how good they are. I REALLY suggest this game to any fan of rpgs to at least give it a shot. Trust me, you'll LOVE it.",5.0

"Takken 3's the one at its best in the series, But to some people just can't let go of tekken 2 because of its amophere and moments. I agree, because to me it has better characters and sub-chacters than no. 1&3. If Heihichi is avalible in tekken 2 without earning him by beating the game with a cetain character, than how come you have to earn him in tekken 3 thats something i don't understand.",5.0
"Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for. Not only theat, but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier. this game also introduced the 10 hit combo, the automatic win. Namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors, this game is a must have for the fighting fans.",5.0
"Ever since I played the demo I have wanted this game. I finally got it and realized how fun it really is. The graphics are pretty good, and the scenery is really pretty. There are lots of different moves that are fairly easy to master. But my personal favorite part is Nina. She totally rocks!",5.0

"I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.

Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.

For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.

The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).

Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.",5.0

"I had to give this 5 stars, this is a classic. I had just gotten into videogames when I started playing this game and it's so much fun to play. If you're competitive this is your game. Other games have come out since this one but this is one of the best. I would recommend this game to any gamer who wants a classic game.",5.0
"i haven't played this game since i was 5 and playing it again for the first time in 11 years i got the biggest wave of nostalgia. i forgot how slow and unreactive the controls were back then haha, not to mention the graphics. not a single circle, only polygons. still a great game though, i highly recommend it",5.0
"This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It Brings back so many memories that it makes it even mor fun to play. The game itself was in mint condition which was extremely impressive. Going as I call it ""old school"" when I bought that game(along with SoulBlade), has just branded a permanent great memory of whn deo games were starting to get really popular. I am NEVER getting rid of this game, and if it wasn't for this game, they wouldn't hve one of the biggest franchises in the gaming world. I am so grateful to have this game once again and will always love it.",5.0
It is so great to be playing this game again. I remember playing this when I was a kid. So many good times with this game!,5.0
"Though this review may be 14 years 2 late,n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games. From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console. TK3 backgrounds,music,fmv cinemas,light source shading,animations/combos just doesn't measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later,go figure!",5.0
"The sequel to the very popular Tekken, Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters, more levels, more moves, Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.

The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations, it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music. It suits the stages, and characters, well.",5.0
"Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. This sequal is too good to miss out on. Buy it before it's gone for good.",5.0
"Tekken has become my favorite fighting game series and a lot of that has to do with the introduction of ""Lei Wulong"".  I feel that Lei is the best character that the series has produced to this day.  Many call him a ""cheese character"" but it's not easy being cheesy  ;-)",5.0
"Same goes for Tekken 2: played but never owned. Now that I'm officially the best Tekken player period, the urge to own all of them, even the first 2, just consumed me....",5.0
"Well, I just recently bought this game again, after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago. People keep on saying, ""Tekken 2 has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible!"", To those people, did you ever think that this game came out during the 90's and was probably awesome graphics back then? If you're a fan of good fighting games, I reccomend this. It has lots of characters, fair graphics, and is a good collectible for your Tekken collection.",5.0
"This is definitely the best of the Tekken series. No, not Tekken 4! Tekken 2. Everything in this game is awesome. The levels, the music score, and obvioulsy, the characters. If you want to save some doe, get this used for under $10 instead of Tekken 4, or Tekken 5 (which is coming soon and I plan on getting.) If you don't have it and you love fighting games, get it now! 10/10",5.0
"THIS GAME WAS A VERY GOOD GAME. BUT THIS AIN'T AS GOOD AS TEKKEN 1.

"From the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character, you know this is special.
Don't just button mash, learn the combos because this is the only game(out of 100)that has made me curs at the TV. If you're a beginner, start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial Law and not Jack 2. BUY THIS because it's an ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.",5.0
"What really exites me about this game is the way the music is put together, i mean the music is very well coordinated and the sound effects and movement are very smooth. I would have to say that my favorite arena on this game is yoshimitsiu's forest level then kazuya's mirror domain. all in all the backgrounds and graphics are the best you can get for a psx game. Also this game delivers a somewhat sadness to it and the environments of the game prove it. This would have to be my most favored tekken game ever.",5.0

JUST THE SAME THING AS {X-MEN VS STREETFIGHTER}AND ALSO
{MARVEL VS CAPCOM} SO WHO CARES IF ITS NOT GOOD AT LEAST
ITS JUST ALMOST THE SAME THING YOU PLAY IN THE ARCADE.

"this game is awesome,i only played it in arcade and i loved it in fact i past it with one quater(since i'm the best ryu user alive).buy the game and when you have it choose ryu and ken(since this game as a 2 on 2 fighting action,that's awesome)they have the best combo ever,ryu knees down and ken is standing up,they both use this huge ""aduken"" that covers the whole screen,its like 52 hits and you only used 1 level(for those who know about the level attacks).the game has good graphics,great backround(3D)you can jump like 20 feet into the air and do some 40something hits,so if you're a begginer at this buy and try it out(i know there no one out there with no experience whatsoever with street fighter or x-men but you never know).good game buy it. God bless you,be good and accept Jesus as your saviour(amen),Jesus rocks.",5.0
"ok, so this obviously isn't the game for the hard core Street fighter fans, or even the folks that frequent the arcade.  Does this mean it's a bad game?  Not by a long shot!  This game used to provide me and my friend hours and hours of entertainment.  We would play all Sunday afternoon... ""I'll get you next time!""  No, it's not as precise, nope, no switching characters, graphics can't compare to the arcade... and if that's what you want you probably shouldn't buy it.  But it -is- simpler than many of the games of this type (you might get lucky and suddenly evoke a combination), if you haven't played it at the arcade regularly you won't miss the second character, is pretty easy for a kid to get the hang of (I'm buying a new copy to continue the Sunday afternoon gaming with my 7 year old) and it's fun!",5.0
"I got this game awhile ago, when i was still 5. I enjoyed fighting games since i was young, and I still am ^^. i'm like twelve LOL. It has ALRIGHT graphics, but hey. Its made in 1997. If you're a true classical gamer, or just a hardcore fighters fan, or maybe even just someone looking for a good fighting game, go ahead. get your a$$ out there in a flea market, pawn, or just from amazon, spend a few bucks on this. The gameplay is VERY good, and it made Tekken into shame. Tekken was really good, until i tried StreetFighter. It has 23 characters. It includes: Ryu, Ken,(what's streetfighter without those two?), Chun-li, Akuma, MANY MANY MORE. It's a good street fighter, I'd liek this one the best. I recomend street fighter 4, graphic wise though... This one has good gameplay, and a fighting system. It's made up of simple kicks and punches. WAIT WAIT WAIT! don't go yet! though it has simple fighting moves, each character has there own style in it. theres also 3-6 special moves for each character, and 2-3 super combos. For streetfighter, hey. 15 combos are pretty good.",5.0
The game was brand new and brought back memories of being a teenager. This was one of my favorite games when it first came out and I remember playing it in the arcade and at home about a million times! I'm glad some one had the foresight to keep it around and I was very pleased with the price.,5.0
"This installment of Street Fighter i believe to be one of the best.
What makes it special is the ability to perform long combos that start with simple moves.  In the beginning this may seem difficult but the game provides a fun and addictive practice mode that walks you through these combos with each character.

Whats so nice about this practice mode is that it saves your progress and unlocks the best characters in the game.  Once Evil Ryu and Super M.Bison are unlocked you would have done enough challenges to be proficient with every character and be able to smash computer and opponent alike.

This is just a fun and great all around set up For the street fighter series.",5.0
"That's right you heard it folks.  I've been playing this game on and off for years since it's arcade appearance, and I beat this game down in the arcade.  I have to say it's the most entertaining 3d fighter out there (street fighter alpha 3 is it's equal but in different ways).  This game makes you form strategies that have to be decided upon and changed within a split second.  Although it being a slower paced game than other SF, the extra time allots you space to form countermeasures against your foe.  Like I said before, this game is more like intense chess than a fighting game.  The controls are customizable and intuitive.  You don't want a novel to tell you how to play a game and this beats the rest with replayability up the ying yang.  Due to unfortunate circumstances I'm about to buy another copy, (for the third time mind you).  You want a great fighting game that doesn't lose its touch, this is it.",5.0

another fightin game. But when I saw those 3D afectes it was mad
phat!!!.Man coudent stop playing the game. I graded this game 5

"Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!! When I first played it, I was frustrated with the controls, but once u learn them, this game is the best!!! The worlds are long and puzzling, but its never too hard to finish. The action and suspense make u feel like its a movie. I reccomend this to anybody who likes action or 007 fans like me. You WILL love it, trust me.",5.0
"TOMB RAIDER is the game that got me hooked on Playstation, and remains my absolute favorite. Like an interactive Indiana Jones movie, the game's a non-stop thrill-ride of deadly traps, dangerous animals, and wondrous sights. Unlike most action games, the protagonist is female, making TOMB RAIDER a suprisingly girl-friendly game. If you're still wondering what all the fuss is about, start here . . .",5.0
"Lara Croft, a British icon rapidly coming on a par with James Bond, is the star of this sassy and imaginative 3D-platformer that was launched more than few years ago now. Originally a replacement for Indiana Jones (Lucasfilm turned down Eidos' approach with the idea) Lara has blossomed into a cult star in her own right.
What was a secondary idea has been proven now to be a slick marketing move. Every girl wants to be like Lara, male gamers want to protect her as they guide her on her way. Lara's appeal is universal. In the game, Lara is the ""Tomb Raider"", an adventurer-cum-archaeologist who searches out ancient artifacts whilst running a gauntlet of rivals, assorted wild beasties and deadly opposition.
The locales she adventures through here are Peru, ancient Greece/Rome, Egypt and an Atlantean island in search of the tripartite Atlantean Scion. Lara is the most smoothly animated character in 3D adventure-gaming and she gets better in the sequels. She can jog, jump, climb and swallow-dive without looking in any way incontinent (unlike others) and she has a nice array of weapons to choose from, including her John Woo-inspired two handguns which come as standard.
The action is cinematic and continuous, your very own adventure indeed. Spending a few hours in Lara's company is well worth it. Highly recommended, even to those who don't normally play video games because they're supposedly for kids alone.",5.0
"And now that Angelina Jolie will play her in the movie, it's official. I'm a woman saying this - she rocks! A great game. Smart and full of action.",5.0
"This is the best game I have yet to play.  It took me six months to finally defeat,figure out and fight my way to the end of this game.  This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling. Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear. You don,t know what,s waiting for you around each corner, waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you. Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds.",5.0
"This game realeased in 1997 (I think), was the first in the Klonoa series (which includles a few more games in Japan), and was defenently a ""sleeper-masterpeice"" for PSone. This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more ""classic fantasyish"" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a ""book theme""). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few ""2.5D"" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game. However, I love this game, and recommend it to all who own a Playstation!",5.0
"Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a must have for any gamer. The first time that i rented a Playstation from a video store, i rented this game with it. I didn't get too far when i rented it, but i liked it so much that i went back to the video store 4 years later and bought it off of them. The graphics are astounding, the gameplay is easy to learn but the difficulty level gets progressively harder as the game goes on. To sum it up, no matter what the price is, buy this game... you won't regret it.

"It's been 4 years since I started this game. I have played several others, and I have yet to see one that beats the original Klonoa. First off, The music is WONDERFUL! It defiantly sets the mood of the level, weather it be fun, frightening, or wierd. The characters: Who can forget Klonoa? The jibberish speaking cat! Huepow, the ring spirit, and Klonoa's sidekick, Gadius, the evil...thing, and Lephise, the Diva who sings the song of rebirth (and several others). The graphics: Awesome! Beautiful! Spectacular!

"I remember playing this game on the computer as a kid. Tomb Raider will always remain as my favourite out of the TR series. This game has numerous levels, which I absolutely love. Some of them are challenging and interesting. I think one of my favourite levels was St. Francis' Folley. I loved going into the different rooms. Each room based off of Greek Mythology. Have the game for my ps2 which is great. The controls are a little bit weird at first, but you do pick it up. This is the game that basically got me started into gaming. If you love the Tomb Raider series, you have to play the original Tomb Raider game.",5.0
"This is an amazing oringal game that I purely enjoyed playing. The storyline is so original for its time and its graphics are amazing on wide screen tv's. In the game, you are Lara Croft, a tomb raider and have been given another opportunity to explore more for artifacts in Peru by Jacalene Natla, a millionaire investor who holds a dark secret. You soon realize she is not what she claims and you do undercover research and she betrays you. You travel thru the dark cold and abandoned caves of peru, ancient underground Greece, the catacombs of Egypt & Atlantis all to find 3 pieces of the scion for which Natla asked her to get, all while blasting out animals and creatures you wouldn't expect and collect secrets along the way. This is a great game that had a greater sequal. But this is my favorite out of the series. Original playstion graphics, great music and sound affects and great storyline!",5.0

"Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it, because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka, the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time.

"I chose this rating, because I love the tomb raider games. The originals are great and amazon sent me a disk that works well. I recommend this game to those who don't need the newest and best graphics. This game is more for fun and adventurous. On this tomb raider so far there hasn't been much of a story. If you are someone who likes a game with a story, I'm not sure this game is right for you. If you are someone who enjoys older games or just a simple adventurous game then maybe you would like it. There are little obstacles for you to do. I used to play all the tomb raider games when i was younger so playing them again brings back good fun memories. Hope this rating helps. Good luck.",5.0
"From the opening theme song on the title screen, you know that this game will be a masterpiece. The locations, enemies, music, atmosphere, gameplay, and Lara herself captivate gamers into playing this wonderful video game. I for one was born about a year before its release and can vividly remember playing this one. Tomb Raider 1 is amongst my top favorite in the series. Many years later (now 2013), I still play this classic from time to time. Just shows how much a game can impact gamers :)",5.0

"This game is a winner, and a true classic.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game.

The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc.

The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use.

The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail.

Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms.

The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too.

This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well.

If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find.

If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

Highly recommend, 5 stars.",5.0
"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure, thriller, problem solving, and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours, but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game.",5.0

"Ya know, I remember playing this game as a kid.
I couldn't find this game anywhere, and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version, so I decided to buy this game as a kid.
It has a great storyline, and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones, then you'd love this game.

Pros (or cons):
Easy to maneuver
Challenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)
Unique storyline involving Atlantis

Cons (or pros):
Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1, so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)
No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themes
Surrealism/constant element of surprise

Personally, I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.
Also, if anyone buys this game, then I have to tell you this: Please, if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>",5.0

I also highly recommend not using the help guides if you prefer to keep your experience 'pure' to discovering the tougher challenges on your own.

Give it time...and you WILL become Lara Croft.",5.0
"I had to go back and play this game after playing (and loving) Tomb Raider Anniversary. Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D? So I'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5.",5.0
"I haven't played Tomb Raider 1 in a long time but a month or so ago I found it at a used cd store and bought it. I just finished the game and am still thrilled at how exciting and tough this game still is. The plot is interesting enough for you to continue caring for the story and Lara Croft makes a fun character to use to get to your next destination. She is strong, knows how to carry her weapons, jump great heights and is truly fearless when it comes to dinosaurs, bad guys and even messed up creatures she meets up with in the end. You have to constantly be kept on your toes throughout the game and the settings themselves are yes very old compared to nowadays improvements but for back then were well done and even nowadays not bad at least to me. This game is a fun challenge and I recommend it to anyone interested in adventure games for Lara will take you on great journeys in this game. My favorite is where she is facing a Sphinx- like statue- now that was a fun level.

Tomb Raider is one of the greatest storylines ever created and that is why it is so popular even nowadays. The older stuff is better though, aka like 1- 4 of the Tomb Raider series is the best to me- everything after 4 seems to have gone downhill. Angel of Darkness honestly I couldn't even finish it was so bad. So take my advice and try out the older version of Tomb Raiders first, they are much better and more exciting.",5.0
"OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  ""Tomb Raider"" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all.

Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something.

It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden ""secrets,"" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous ""medi-paks.""

Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.",5.0
"This game entertained me for hours when it first came out oh so many years ago! I was deeply enthralled, and soon my dad became obsessed as well. We would spend hour upon hour playing it! My mom was fine with it, but other jealous mothers would ask her if she wasn't even the least bit worried that Lara was so attractive, and has such big... assets. She was great, alright, but the game was just as fun. Many different levels provide for awesome gameplay. My only complaint is the annoying save crystals. Yeah, those are horrible. But overall it's a really fun game! Better than most of the recent Tomb Raider games, but TR3 is probably my favorite! It's a classic, buy it! You won't regret it. ENJOY!!!!!",5.0
"Ok, sounds perveted. It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy, adventurous, and alluring Lara Croft, but many other people do too.
Anyway, this is it. The first ""Tomb Raider"" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all.
It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every ""Tomb Raider"" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!
Anyway, a highly reccomended game. But I liked ""Tomb Raider 2"" way better then this one.",5.0
"If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that.
Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious.
The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick ""about-face"".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well.
There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, ""The God Room"" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played.
So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review ""Dear Eidos"") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.
EIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!",5.0
"From the ancient Incan ruins of Peru, the classical Greek-Norse Roman world, the Eygptian pyramids and tombs, to the nightmarish fantisy dreamworld of Atlantis, this game is a true classic and simply the best game in the series. Here are some examples:
-Excellent 3-D levels such as:
1. Caves
2. City of Vilcambamba
3. Lost Valley
4. Tomb of Qualopec
5. St. Francis' Folly
6. Colosseum
7. Palace Midas
8. The Cistern
9. Tomb of Tihocan
10. City of Khamoon
11. Obelisk of Khamoon
12. Sanctuary of the Scion
13. Natla's Mines
14. Atlantis
15. The Great Pyramid
-Great weapons such as:
Pistols
Shotgun
Magnums
Uzis
-Deadly enimies such as:
Creatures of Atlantis,
wolves, alligators,bears,raptors
and a T-Rex
-Great items for puzzels such as:
All kinds of keys, a gold idol, lead bars,
machine cogs, and artifacts of Eygpt
Also a great plot! In her first adventure, Lara sets out to find the Scion, an artifact of Atlantis. Natla, who sends her out on her informat, haunted me troughout the game by setting out a squad of people... who kept on shooting at me when I least expected. I managed to beat the whole game without a guide (mabye with a few tips but nothing else) but it wasn't easy. The game is filled with impossibilities. The first level made me think this would be a nice easy action game, but as I kept on playing I found out I was extremly wrong. But its a wonderful game nothingless. People who play will be stunned for days. I highly call it my favorite game yet.",5.0
"So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase ""girl power"", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time.
The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end.
The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now!
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...",5.0
"It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway. The level's are so cool it's get's better each time you go to a new level. Each level have something you must do before you go on. There are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath pack's get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you O, if you fine anything useful get that too.
Sometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look that's all.
This was my only game that I own for my playstation. That the time I did't know if I sould play it or leave it alone will I play it and you know what, I like it for once a woman is doing the thing and I said it's about time, do you know what I mean??
Well go have fun I did. Take your time and do it right I did and I got good at.",5.0
"Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996, the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays, every other game is a 3d adventure ""in the vain of Tomb Raider"".
The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?
While TR 2 is the best in the series, this one will be the most remembered.

"My wife and I first learned of Tomb Raider while living in Japan.  We babysat a playstation while its owner visited the States over New Years holiday. We were stunned by the opening music as the Playstation powered up, and sat amazed as the game unfolded. The instructions were in Kanji, so we spent quite a few lives learning the controls.  My wife drawing and reholstering her pistols a dozen times or more while a pack of wolves nipped at our heels--me grabbing the controls in a manic panic--it was great (frantic) fun.  When we moved back to the States, we picked up a Playstation and a Tomb Raider game.  It was just as much fun, just as addictive and we return to it even after TRII, Last Revelation and Chronicles.  The music on the first level alone is worth the price of admission!  I'm now planning to buy the pc version just to have my windows schemes keyed to TR music. What fun!  Let the games begin!",5.0
"This game is challenging, fun, and any teen will like it! It has cool graphics, and you can use the items around as resources for items, (EX. If you beat up a dumpster you may get a weapon or health item.) It took me and my friend 6 months to finish it! You can combine moves, too! You also get a variety and sometimes you get to pick where you want to go! (EX. You go to the subway, naval or air force.) Well, if you want a GREAT Playstation game, get Fighting Force. The only 2 bad things is that you won't be able to pry your kids off it, and the 2nd Fighting Force has only 1 player when the first has up to 4!",5.0

"Yes I am playing and reviewing a game that came out back in 1997.  There aren't too many ""beat them up"" games anymore.  Most of the stuff they put out is single player and may require some stealth.  Thankfully Fighting Force isn't one of those.  This is such a fun game to play with another friend and I did just that today.  And when the going gets tough, you can cheat and become invulnerable.  Enough said.",5.0
"Alrighty, let me just start off by saying don't let people who play ""Final Fantsay 7"" sway your judgement about this.  While ""Final Fantsay 7"" is an amazing game, it varies VERY HEAVILY from ""Fighting Force"", so what some people like (fun fighting games)and others love (RPG gamers) we are at war with the worlds.  It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really ""snazzy"" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a ""Streets of Rage"" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:

  Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.

  Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5

  Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)

  Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.  I feel this game is totally undercredited, and that we need to change that.  ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!",5.0
I have this game Before it is better than Fighting Force 2 Because you can play 3 other Characters Besides Hawk Mansion.,5.0
"This is a fun game. I was playing it with my friend, and he kept kicking me. He even killed me twice. He said the second time I walked right into it.:P Anyway, this is also kinda funny too. I mean, the character's faces don't look that gorgeous. But the characters fighting abilities are great. And you can smash stuff like cars, coke machines, ash trays, etc.. And you get destruction points. If you get enough, you get a continue. And they have cool guns. I think the best weapons are the bats, poles, and pipes. And if you have a gun, when you run out of ammo, you can throw it at your enemy. And if you find something and you have no idea what it is,(if it looks like a small black thing that fits it your charcters hand), it's a grenade. And when you throw it, you better get away quickly. And they have great bosses. I think the funnest level is when you're at the subway, there's a bunch of suitcases there that you can throw at your enemies. And you can even eat sandwiches or beat up a coke machine to regain your health. It's much more fun, in my opinion, to play with 2 players. well, buh-bye. hope this review helps you. :)",5.0

"From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice, Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original. In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds.
Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for?
I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.",5.0

"An astounding commercial success in 1997 and still holds up well today, Tomb Raider 2 was a step in the right direction.  It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best.
The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end, and get every secret without any hints.  One of my top favorite five video games of all time.  And a true high water mark for Play Station 1 and maybe video games in general.",5.0
"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual ""Tomb Raiding"" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels, but it's only for the PC)",5.0
"Theses are real video games, the ones you work on for weeks before you finally reach that last awesome cutscene concluding the game. You'll never feel such joy until you play this.
It's definitely different than the first. In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them. Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs.
The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see...
You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles.

there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did.
This game is still full of an lot of things, and quite frankly it still freaks me out to play. It's sheer awesomness and I recommend.",5.0

Yeah, the graphics are good but I didn't like the Lara portrayed and the play is completely different - it really doesn't feel like Tomb Raider at all. My only complaint with the old one is the response is a little slower but its not bad enough to dramatically effect anything I'm doing in the game anyway. Old school Lara is hot and bad ass, which is how she should stay. I'll take the cheesy graphics and awesome game play over a crappy Lara and quick time button pressing BS.",5.0

"I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun. I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. ""The Wall"" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc ""old and scratched up"" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.",5.0

Tomb Raider II is one of the most fun games I've ever had.  I have the entire collection of tomb raider games.  With this one you get to visit Tibet with extensive ladders, catacombs, traps, snow, bad guys, wild animals, and lots of adventuring.  There are plenty of medipacks, but use them wisely.  There are great cheats and glitches to help you in your journey if you get stuck.  There is alot of problem solving, but easy enough to get without the help of a strategy guide.  In this Lara Croft issue, you will go to Venice and use a speedboat, go to Tibet and use a snowmobile, and explore the depths of the ocean and discover the Maria Dora!!!  You even get a underwater scooter.  Funny, but I had a glitch with mine that allowed me to fly above the water and I actually ran out of air and died!!  HEE, HEE.  A barrel of laughs with each death and new adventure.  There's even an invisible bridge in Tibet and two T-rexes in the beginning of the game before the zipline in the chasm (enjoy)!  Lots of suprises for the gamer.",5.0
"Best memories include handling the grenade launcher and dealin' with them stinkin' Yetis that scared the HELL outta me!---but in NO WAY does it go downhill from there! Face it, you've probably experienced better game graphics, but for overall story, plot, action, adventure and intrigue, there aren't too many that can touch the 'TR' series. Being a continuity stickler, the only thing I could find wrong was the change in voice actress from the first game to this one. Other than that, no worries---buy it and have yourself a BLAST!!!",5.0

"this game lacked the ability to live up to name ""Tomb Raider"" its more of a ""City Raider"" half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasn't feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part.",5.0
"A major Tomb Raider fan, I decided to play all the games over again and finished both part one and now part two and they're both still as great as I remember. I think both are strong and worthwhile games with great plots but Tomb Raider Two is more tough, but that's the point of a sequel. It's longer (or at least it felt that way, especially when it came to the Ocean part of the game) yet I enjoyed playing it.
Both Tomb Raider One and Two have interesting plots and both are different. In Tomb Raider Two it has to deal with a Dagger that throughout the story grows more important to find and soon. You go through many different levels than you did on Tomb Raider one- including the Floating Islands- which is one weird level but very fascinating. My favorite levels were in Venice, the places in Tibet and yes the Floating Islands. Home Sweet Home level was a little scary- being attacked in her own home!- but I thought it was a good twist. The ending itself was tougher than the first one that's for sure, and I did say a few curse words while trying to finish the game, but eventually when I did finish I knew that it was worthwhile. I had to get a strategy guide nonetheless to beat this game, because indeed in many levels it was a little too tough for me to figure out, but then there's no shame in getting a little help.

Overall the game is more hard and challenging and just as creative in plot as part one was (the storylines are way good). I enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone who loved part one.",5.0
"The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay, sense of exploration through massive levels, and a unique main character.  The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.",5.0
"Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!

After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...",5.0
"This game is great to get into and back again never mind. So the level's are great you get to go Tibet, China, Venice and a sunken, ship. The background is not so good but it's ok. And you get small heath and large heath packs. These heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for them.
Arm yourself with:
automatic pistols, harpoon gun, rocket launcher, M16 rifle, Uzis, shotguns, flares and more!
Kill them or be kill by:
monks, yetis, great white sharks, killer eels, dobermans and more. BE CAREFUL PLEASE!!

"I loved this game as a child and I love it now. Very happy to have purchased this. Story is interesting, bosses are interesting, gameplay is hella. Very dark and creepy, I love it. Eidos really had it going on in the 90's.

The game came quickly, but the case was splattered with barbecue sauce. Like, really? You couldn't have just cleaned the sauce off before sending it? That's pretty disgusting. I don't know where your barbecue has been. I don't know if you were sucking on the game after barbecue chicken. Yet I had to clean it anyways.

Totally worth it though.",5.0
"I thought id reviewed already, but here goes.  Not your typical ninja game, as most are stealth, this one is more the action side of things, tons of weapons, some special powers, projectiles, and level kind of puzzles. Think ol school brawlers (final fight) meets 3D as a ninja. Cool art to be seen but not cool enough to forget it takes awhile to load as you look at it (load screen).  Fast paced and fun, easy controls and cool lvl design. One other thing is graphics, moderate maybe for ps1, but just bad by todays standards when some ps1's still hold up better.  But that is overlookable as it doesn't hinder gameplay, and is so much fun to play, your just a bad azz ninja. In short bad grfx, long loads, but still so worth being this ninja.",5.0
"I can't complain about this game because it's a fun game for me at least. I had this game as a child but I never got to play the whole game because of how frustrating it was to just get through the 3rd level. It was fun nonetheless and an awesome game. Not recommended for those who don't like hard to maneuver controllers, extremely hard levels as you progress, spontaneous monsters/ people who appear out of absolutely nowhere off screen and/or Ninjas. This game is a classic and generational understanding.",5.0
"I used to love this because the graphics were great with the best cenery seen in a Ninja game on the PLAYSTATION. The problem is you collect power ups for your shurikuns(throwing stars)that make them pretier and powerfuler, when you die you have to look for more treasure chests as you progress through the game.
I've recently bought NINJA GAIDAN for XBOX and that game reminded me of this with the great cenery and graphics.",5.0
"Hi there. I love this game, for the fact that it has all these little extra surprises. Wether it is opening a treasure chest, or the chuckle I get each time I splice a skelleton in half, and it's lower body half is still kicking me. Too funny.  The game does have its irritating part, where it is just a bit too difficult, but at least there are several safepoints along each level.  The cheat codes for this game are too cool as well. I suggest that if you buy the game, you look them up. The magic move actually turns into a big ole thunder/lighting that eliminates everyone in close proximity. And for the price, this game is definately worth a shot.  I may not be a die-hard playstation nut, but I sure like playing this ninja game best, out of the 20+ games we own.",5.0
"Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series. Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, ""Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before."" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).",5.0
"The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos.
Lets go over it:
1st - classic with no supers lots of characters
2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters
3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each
Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.",5.0
"This game is awsome. When i first got it I played it all night. After that I played it all the time. I like how it has lots of different types of matches to choice from, Tornado is the BEST.

"I bought this game when it first came out, and I've kept all these years, and for good reason, this is one of if not the best SRPG ever made, although you probably wouldn't think that just looking at it.

First off the game really doesn't look that good, especially when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics, while FFT has crisp well animated characters, Tactics Ogres characters look blocky discolored and have only a few animations which don't look that natural to begin with.  The music is okay, but nothing special, of note is the absolutly absurd ""death screams"" that each gender makes when they die.  The females sound like someone has pinched them and the males sound like they're doing a bad monkey impression.  I only mention it because I thought Final Fantasy Tactics had really good screams.  While the graphics are rather bland the gameplay fares much better.

Tactics Ogre battle system really doesn't add anything new to the SRPG genre, you enter a map filled with knights and wizards, and sometimes monsters, you choose your soldiers and then attempt to kill them before they kill you.  Tactics Ogre utilizes a lot more ""Defeat the Leader"" then other Tactics games, in fact it uses ""Defeat the Leader"" more than it uses ""Defeat al Enemies"" so its important to weigh the pros and cons of defeating everyone else, since if a character is killed in battle thay are gone from the game, their are some resurrection spells in the game, but you won't be able to get them until about the last quarter of the game so for the majority of it you have to be sure that you don't get you team members killed.

The game does one thing that I don't really like, that is that it has scaleable enemy levels, the enemy's level scales up or down depending on your level, which means even if you train a lot often the enemy will still be at the same level as you, its kind of aggrivating to train for 2 hours just to have the enemy auto level itself up to your level.  As for training its a tedious little venture, basically you enter training mode which can be done anytime on the world map, you split your forces into two teams then they fight each other, you can control wither team, both, or neither, and just have the computer play both sides, but the fastest way is to control both sides and had weaker characters hit the stronger ones, while the stronger ones just stand around.  The whole thing is very boring, however since Tactics Ogre is a pretty difficult game you'll find yourself having to train quite a bit.

Now on to the reason that I gave this game 5 stars, the storyline.  This game has an incredible storyline.  It starts out simple enough, your main character is a rebel soldier trying to liberate his people from oppression.  The story will eventually evolve into you trying to stop an evil being from destroying the island, but for the majority of the game it's a war story, and this is where it really excels.  It excels not only because it's a great story, but also because you get to shape the story as you go.  At the end of the first chapter you'll have to make an extremely difficulty choice, whether to sacrifice your ideals in order to have a chance to win and liberate your people, or to stick to you ideals even though your people might stay slaves forever.  The best part about this choice and indeed all the choices is there is no wrong answer, but more importantly there is no right answer.  Depending on your choice people close to your character will die, and some will die no matter what you choose.  Characters that might join your party if you make one choice will become bitter enemies that you will be forced to kill in battle if you make another. For example in order for the main character to gain his ultimate class you have to have a certain character die, either by not saving them or killing them off in battle, either way they are gone for goos, and yet your main character is stronger for it.

It's slightly dissapointing that although you have a lot of choices to change the story throughout it will still end about the same.  The last chapter is near identical no matter what choices you made, the only difference is what characters are still alive and which are in your party.  The final boss is the same no matter what, and he seems tacked on.

The game has plenty of side quests to keep you busy, most notably hell's gate, a 100 floor dungeon.  Besides for that their are a lot of secret characters and a few secret classes to unlock, that coupled with the games already long storyline means this one is gonna keep you busy for awhile.  No to mention the fact you'll want to play it at least 2 or 3 times to get the full experience, their is nothing quite as heart warming as having an enemy from a former game join your party, or as sad as watching someone who fought side by side with you die in the mud because they didn't agree with your choices.

Overall I can't recommend this game enough, although it has a few faults, you'll quickly forget about them once you get sucked in to the storyline, its gritty, brutal, full of death and betrayal, has a few massacres mixed in for flavor, and it comes out as one of the most intense and well written storylines to date.",5.0
"I must confess, I bought this game only because I had played Final Fantasy Tactics and loved it. Desperate for a strategy/RPG fix, I got TO because many of FFT's creators had worked on it. But just because it preceded FFT does not mean it's not as good...on the contrary, it actually is more fun and absorbing than its slickly polished descendant.
Let's start with the bad news. Tactics Ogre was originally released for the Super NES, and it shows. With small, blocky sprites and the inability to rotate a camera (because the background is also 2D), TO won't be winning any graphics awards anytime soon. The in-game speech portraits are nice, though.
Tactics Ogre can also occasionally get monotonous - the most common culprit being the constant need for training. There's also a special 100-floor (!) dungeon that is not for the faint of heart.
Now the good news: The story is absorbing. TO takes place in the island nations of Valeria; you play Denim Powell, a young member of the Walstanian ethnic group. He, his sister Kachua, and his friend Vice are determined to lead Walsta out from under the oppressive hand of the ruling Gargastan. They're helped in this aim by a group of exiled warriors from Zenobia: the heroes of the first game in the Ogre Battle Saga. Eventually the scope of the conflict widens to include the rest of Valeria, and culminates in a bitter struggle for the High King's throne and for the power of an incredibly powerful magical artifact. TO's story would be its strongest point...except for one thing.
The gameplay.
Dear God, the gameplay. It's like a sundae smothered in hot fudge, chocolate sprinkles, whipped cream, and with a cherry on top: wonderful, but occasionally overkill. TO's gameplay is definitely deep; while it doesn't have the huge list of jobs and abilities that its descendant, Final Fantasy Tactics, does, I can't help but feel it's without a doubt more complex in terms of strategy. With over a dozen sidequests, not to mention three distinct paths through the game (each of which has its own special characters to get), there's no question that TO has even more replay value than FFT. And that's really saying something!
Tactics Ogre is definitely a game not to be missed. While Atlus is no longer making the game, if you can buy a used copy, do!",5.0
"Tactics Ogre is all about the hardcore experience.  Not only are the graphics nothing special, they border on offensive.  Looking at this game, you'd wonder how anybody could give it a high rating.  That's where our little friend, Gameplay, comes in.  He suggests that graphics don't matter, that he can offer a much more fulfilling experience.  He introduces you to his brother, Storyline, and tells about how deep and involving Storyline's personality is.  Storyline is quite the plotter; he can tread on the feet of kings and peasants without losing a beat.  He propagates destructive forces (ghouls, necromancers, chaos knights, etc.) while staying true to human emotion (people die, people are sad, people revenge).  He does all this through the medium of plastic, namely the disc entitled Tactics Ogre.
The storyline and gameplay (containing a job system that was FFT's predecessor, though not matching its depth enjoyable nonetheless) are quite well done.  If you can look past the surface (don't stare at that ugly brother!) then there is much to love about Tactics Ogre.
P.S. This game has a 100 (that's not a typo) level dungeon that focuses entirely on fighting and item finding.  You must traverse it twice to obtain an extremely valuable item.  Talk about hardcore!",5.0
"SO ... good. Tons of replay value and the game is like 70+ hours each go through!!! Its alot like FF tactics(this game preceeding and the creator dude of this one made FF Tactics the good game it was) only you can attack an enemy out of range and still have a chance of hitting, you gets tons of monsters that can increase in class and skill just like people, cool special characters from Ogre Battle, and the training option out-does FF Tactics allowing you to advance in lvls faster before battles. Heres a tip, get a high lvl beserker over 30 kills to get the option of ""Terror Knight"" that automatically causes all enemies within a certain range to suffer attack and defence penalties.",5.0

"While lacking in the graphics department(This game was originally designed for the super famicom) this game really is one of the best RPGs on PSX(destorying FF Tactics easily).  The story is very long and draws you in right from the start.  The battles for the most part are very challenging and very well done.  Outside of battle you are given a lot of control over your large army(Of which you take 10 into battle) and you can always persuay other humans and monsters to join in your fight. There are a huge variety of different classes ranging from the usual(Knight, Cleric) to Gunner and Swordmaster.  There are also a lot of various creatures, including golems, ghosts, hawkmen, and some really weird things that you can find in the expansive hidden dungeon(100 levels) called Hell's Gate.  The best part about this game is the non-linearity to it, at several places in the game you are asked to make decisions that not only affect your army, but affect all the rest of the characters in the game.  Each option leads you down a very different path to victory(there are 8 ending in all) of this very large game.  If you can find this game, I suggest you buy it!",5.0

"This game is responsible for me losing more sleep than almost any other. This game really isn't for everyone though. It's more of a passive RPG, you don't personally go out and do the fighting (you can, it's just not a good idea), you send out constructed units of troops to do the fighting with the enemy units. Terrain, weight, time of day and equipment all play a part in moving and battles. While you can not directly influence the course of the individual battles, you can decide which troops go to either the front or back rows (different attacks depending on the row), and decide what the unit will aim for (attack the strongest, weakest, leader or best). You can support them with Tarot cards (single use magic spells) that you pick up by liberating cities. All in all, one of the most innovative and all around fun games I've ever played, and it got improved for the Playstation. Worth practically whatever you have to pay for it.",5.0

"There was once an era of video games where experimentation was the norm, where risks were taken and genres were born (or died). Games were made up of more heart and soul, each having a unique (if not always good) vision. While many games during this era were not commercially successful megahits that every kid on the block owned, there existed a special kind of game that gave a truly joyful experience to every kid who dared risk their precious $50 of summer savings on it.

Brigadine is one such game.

While essentially a fairly solid hexagonal turned based Strategy-RPG with leveling and class promotion systems, Brigadine manages to surpass its trappings and elevate itself above other competing SRPGs by providing what few could at the time - an Epic tale of a continent at war told through an open world format closer to sandbox style gameplay than anything else I've yet to see. Sandbox style gameplay in a SRPG? Yes, indeed it is true.

While I do not have the room to truly delve into every aspect of the game, I will highlight the main points below:

Pros
+ Can select from quite a few different Kingdoms to play at the beginning of the game - each with own unique plotline, style, and beginning characters.
+ Sandbox style game means you have a different game every time!
+ Each unique, named character in the game comes with their own anime portrait and backstory. This helps a lot towards making you care about them and their growth in battle.
+ Questing system for named characters allows you to assign characters on a journey. The results of which can lead to plot points, powerful new items, new allies (named characters), or stat upgrades. There are lots of other results, I was just naming a few common ones.
+ Questing system makes for strategic decision making. Do I send a powerful hero or specific plot trigger hero out on a quest, or use them to fight another battle?
+ Great item system, lots of different equipment
+ Multiple tier class promotion system. I hate SRPGs that only allow a class to upgrade into ONE other class, regardless. Makes it feel like a cop out.
+ 3d animation is available for fight cutscenes. I turn them off usually for faster battles, but they are offered.
+ Magic is not all powerful, and is balanced right to be strategic but not necessary.
+ Great load times!

Cons
- Limited AI. This is the PSX era. While good, it does fall pray to more straight forward tactics.
- Multiplayer offerings are limited... this is PSX, so no internet play. This game would have further trasncended if they did offer it.
- Wish there was a cooler intro movie.
- Certain units are fairly useless or have narrow usefulness. While some may argue, this is my opinion.
- Love the music, wish there was more though.
- Sound effects are sometimes a bit... rudimentary. When I 1-shot kill something, a limp sounding hit will ruin my enjoyment. Sometimes it ends up being just funny though.

Misc
= Japanese version exists that allows you additional scenario and ""final boss"" of sorts. While normally I wouldn't mention this, there exists some plot resolution issues for those that do not know of or have access to this version.
= Hard to find game. Very expensive.

All in all, this is one I was very glad I picked up when I was younger. Every time I feel like going and playing out my own epic fantasy war (like after reading certain George RR Martin books, for example), this is the title I choose.

"This game is hands down the best strategy RPG ever made.

The classes for humans and monsters are the most balanced you will ever find.

After a while you will get too good at winning this, and you can play a harder mode in which you let the computer control every battle.  It's very enjoyable to see the decisions you make in building an army reflected in almost every way possible when you let the computer take over the battles.

Truly a masterpiece in strategy, with a few setbacks that don't hurt the game too much.

"Not hard to beat at all if you are into it, even on hard mode.  There are limited classes and units.  The gameplay gets redundant after awhile.  The music is good though.

For example, you should keep the hydra on water so it can heal itself to infinity.  The graphic is terrible in 3D but awesome in 2D because it is hand-drawn.",5.0

"If you like Mario Kart 64, then you will absolutely love this game! Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me.

I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can ""read past its cover"" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.

Overall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.",5.0

The technology responsible for the realistic effect experienced in the X-Files Game is the first of its kind to be used in  video gaming. You will be astounded by the full motion video and how it  draws you into the story. It feels as though every action you take is  crucial to the development of the story...as if every thing you do might  have repercussions. The entire game has that creepy X-Files feel, inducing  that familiar shiver as you explore the dark, ominous corners that permeate  every scene in the X-Files Game.  My one and only problem with the game is  the sparcity of Mulder and Scully appearances throughout.  They don't show  up until disk five, and after that they have little involvement. Despite  this, they are rarely missed; a testament to how entertaining this game is.  I applaud Jordan Lee(Agent Willmore) and Paige White (Agent Astadourian)  for their superb acting.  They hold the story together, while not being  overwhelmed by the amazing graphics of this game. Those of you who purchase  this, prepare for a wild ride.  The white-knuckle finale will leave you  begging for more.",5.0
This was lots of fun for me because I like the show so much. This game is kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure story (but much more advanced)and depending on how you treat the people you meet in the game the outcomes of  situations vary a lot.  It just made me feel so much like I was actually on  a case that I would be on the edge of my seat in fear when something risky  was going on...and not many games can do that for me.  I think seeing  familiar characters talking directly to me added to the feeling of actually  being there.  If you like the show you'll love the game!,5.0
"This game is a lot of fun, with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully. I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more, but I think you  still see enough of them to keep most fans happy, plus I found the  character of Agent Willmore (whom you play) to be very likeable. The  storyline is very strong, the puzzles make sense, and the full motion video  (FMV) sequences are very good. There are not very many FMV games around  anymore, so if you like your adventure games with video sequences, this is  really a ""must have"".",5.0
"Ive been an on and off fan of the x files for years until recently, now im a huge fan!! but going threw the times when i was on again off again one of the things that never differed was my love for this game. it may be getting along in years now but its still on of the best games ive ever played. the story is an excellent addition to the x files world. you play as agent craig willmore who is an FBI agent from Seattle, has been called on by AD skinner to find mulder and scully who have dissapeared under strange circumstances.

i know there are some whiny people saying ""but i wanted to play as mulder and scully"", well thats not really very original for a game now is it. everyone would have expected that, and in this game you really do feel like your part of it because theres no association between familiar characters. meaning your not playing a character that will constantly remind you that this game isn't real. and getting to mulder and scully makes it all the more realistic. besides if you wanna play as mulder and scully i recommend the PS2 X Files game Resist & Serve.

anyway back to the review,the point and click aspect of the game is not as dumb as you would imagine, i believe it keeps thing simple control wise so you can focus on the paranormal mystery. i don't want to give to much away but there are plenty of twists and turns in this game to keep you enthralled and guessing for hours of play.

the acting is excellent, the feel of the game is eery and mysterious (as it should be) believe me when i say tht this game is not just for x files fans, it can be enjoy by anyone! it truely is a great game and i definitely recommend it.",5.0
I love this game.  It is almost impossable to find games that DON'T have CGI in them.  I don't want to play pixelated characters from a computer screen.  I want to see live action actors that you can manipulate and have talk to people.  This game really is a great deal of fun.,5.0
"After a few seasons and a movie, Fox and 1013 Productions have decided to create a game, which keep everyone who played it, inside the paranormal-freaky-and-lovable trama of The X-Files. Filled with high-one-of-a-kind FMV, oustanding soundtrack and a more than credible history, the search for the truth wasent so fun until now.",5.0
"Normally i don't like Strategy-Type games. But this one was great. Ofcourse, there is a lot of conversation and stuff. But it still was a great game. The only thing i didn't like is that u can't have full control of the game. I mean like, u can say whatever u want, u can choose the dialogue only from the options available. And Scully really irritates u a lot in this game. All i could do was shoot her in the game. I ended up in jail. If there was more choices, i would have pissed her off in the game. I mean seriously, u go to help her, she behaves like she's the queen of the world. I especially liked the last part. U turn off the lights in ur house and play the last part of the game, man it's scary. All the scary music and all of a sudden soldiers show up. It was great. However, I'll tell u this, Willmore dosen't look like a 33 year old guy nor does he look like a father of a kid. He looks much younger.",5.0
I thought this was a great game.  There were a few times that I got stuck but I eventually worked my way out of it.  The music really set the tone.  I give it two thumbs up.,5.0
"As a fan of Myst and Riven, I would not put this game in the same  category.  However, it does equally well for it's type.  Myst and Riven  don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you  have a name and a face.
The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore.  He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully.  As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining.
I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot.
The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up.
All in all a good buy.  When's the next one?",5.0

"Let me just start off by saying that Rogue Squadron is one of my favorite trilogies! All three games are great! This one in particular shines the brightest! Graphics still hold up extremely well especially after 18 years! Great storyline set in between A New Hope and Empire.. Featuring the voice talent of Bob Bergen as Luke Skywalker, this is, in my opinion the greatest title on the N64! (Sorry Goldeneye, you're good but your not THIS good!)",5.0

"So, after Twisted Metal 2, 989 Studios took over and proceeded to make both Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4.  Well...in my personal opinion, I think they really did a fantastic job.

People are always going to complain about ""omgz it'z not likez the originalz!!""  Ok, we get it, it's not like the originals, got it.  Just because it's not like TM and TM2, does not make it a bad game.  I feel like TM3 and TM4 get the Batman Forever/Batman and Robin treatment, when it's not at all like that.  I'm here to shed some light on the subject and say it like it is.

Single Trac and 989 Studios had very different approaches when they made their TM games.  Some good and some bad.  I'm not going to lie, Single Trac had much better level design, vehicles, and story.  However, the one place where I think Single Trac failed, was in the game play itself.  Simply put, TM3 and 4 are just more fun to actually play than the first two.  They have more replay value, and are just more laid back in general, with hours of campy, fun entertainment.  I'm not saying TM 3 and 4 are better made games, that's debatable, but I can spend countless hours on TM3 and 4, but I'll get bored with 1 and 2 in 30 minutes. Anyway, I'm here to talk about the game itself.

Pros

Fun, very addicting game play
Many entertaining ways to play (God Mode, Hangar 18, Club Kid, 7 enemies.  Have fun.)
This version of Thumper is my personal favorite
Much more fluid game play than it's predecessors.  Things just...flow better
You don't die by getting rammed twice
It gave us one of the coolest final bosses in the TM series

Cons

Story lines are seriously stupid
Levels are HORRIBLE, except for London, which is amazing
Controls can be a bit sluggish
If you started with 1 and 2, this game will be your living hell
New vechicles are laughable, save for Firestarter, her's cool

Overall, I honestly don't know what it is.  It's just the way the game flows.  I can drive around while eating popcorn or whatever, fight to the death and not worry about losing all my health in 2 seconds because I accidentally hit Axel while driving.  Even on Pure Lunacy (Hard Mode), it's insanely hard but it's...fair.  I feel like the first two games were just unfair and it was just annoying at times.  I would die for no reason in those games.  In this game, you know what's going on , you know what weapon hit you, you're just more aware of things happening.  I have beaten all TM games on every difficulty with every character so no, I don't just ""suck"" at the first two.  This game, while it does have some control problems and whatnot, it gave us a different approach to the TM series, some good, some bad.  TM3 and 4, while not the best made in the series, I come back to them more than any other game in the series.  Purely for the addiction and overall entertainment factor and hours I've spent playing this, it gets 5 stars easily.",5.0

"This is a great game, with surprisingly good graphics for an old system like the Nintendo 64. I like ""shoot-em-up"" games, and this is definitely one of the good ones. I'm an old man, and newer systems my family has, like the XBox and PS-3, are much too fast for me. Also, I really like the game cartridge system of the Nintendo 64. Unlike the XBox and PS-3, there isn't a disc that can get scratched or a reader that gets dirty and stops reading discs, which I've seen happen on the XBox. If the Nintendo's game cartridge stops working, which isn't often, just spray electronics cleaner on the contacts and it works again. The Nintendo 64 is a system I've had for a lot of years, and it still works great.",5.0

"I believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because, the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games. Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all. And this one I really do like very much.",5.0

"With the best game engine currently in release underlying killer sound effects, great graphics, and the most evil enemy AI, Unreal is sure to stick around as one of the top games for a long time. Add to this the  number of online servers and multiplayer support available for this game  and you'll have a grand ol' time killing all your friends! The unsupported  level editor which ships with the game can be fixed with a patch from the  Unreal website and then you're making your own levels with the easiest  design interface I've ever used. The game could easily benefit from some  extra speech and humor (you don't hear a peep out of your own character  until you die), but it's dark atmosphere and excellent surprises should  have your heart pumping everytime you have to look around a corner. Whether  your a die-hard gameplayer or a detail-happy level designer, this one's for  you.",5.0

"I played this a lot when I was little. I had borrowed it from a friend and they took it back. So when I wanted to play it again I couldn't. They didn't sell them in stores anymore. So I forgot about it for nearly ten years. Until finally when I got all nostalgic and was remembering stuff I used to do. Even though I only played this a couple weeks many years ago it stuck. So I looked on here and was worried knowing old games such as Nintendo  and PS1 could've been hundreds of dollars. Then I saw this for only a couple bucks. I have tons of used games and they work great. So I got this used game. Now to the actual review!

The game did not come with the original case (I already knew that so it's cool,so no big deal).It was a little dirty,but hey it's used so as long as it works just clean it and it's as good as new. My system is very old and definitely needs cleaning or replacement all together bcuz the screen is fuzzy. It could be the game,I don't know. Whichever the case,I can deal with a little fuzz bcuz I can still see pretty clear. Even if it is the game that is fuzzy that's ok cuz it's used and was $3. I'm not complaining cuz I still get a great game for a great price. Something that is pretty cool is I think the previous owners data was still on it...cuz every level was completed and I could play all my favorite levels without waiting for ones I might not want to play at the moment. So thanks cuz I get impatient! Speaking of which,my shipping. I was expecting it to come in a month...but it came in a week! Now that's fast shipping! Great game,great seller.

Bottom line:Very Satisfied,yes I would recommend this to a friend. 10/10",5.0
"You have to understand that for me, the same as for probably scores of other kids and kids at heart, there was just about nothing closer to my heart or more thrilling to my imagination than the prospect of being a starfighter pilot in the Star Wars universe. Which is to say that there could not have been a game that excited me more, simply by the prospect of its subject matter. The amazing thing about Rogue Squadron was how good it was. Gameplay, graphics. It was not just a subpar product with a Star Wars sticker on it (there have been plenty of those, in the videogame sphere and beyond); it was a well-designed, terrific, replayable game in its own right. So for me, it was a brilliantly enjoyable gaming experience. I have been using past-tense verbs, because I sold all of my N64 gear years back, but for anyone looking for a good N64 game or a first-class Star Wars experince in particular, Rogue Squadron *is* a very fine choice.",5.0
"I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played.

Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire!

Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.

Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots.

Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.

Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is?

It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.",5.0

It's one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the 1st Star Wars films. The controls are great and it's easy to get used to. It shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like Hoth. If your a Star Wars nut like me, get it!!!",5.0
"I was feeling nostalgic last week so I started playing Unreal again.  Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed.

I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to ""ignore"".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that ""ignore"" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a ""load"" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system.

That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it.

As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around!

Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life.

The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much.

Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5",5.0
"This is such an impressive game. I grew up with this game as a little girl, watching my dad play it, because I was so scared I refused to. Then I got a few years older and began playing it myself, at age seven, I think. I just beat it again a few days ago. But the point is this video game is everything a video game should be. The graphics are AWESOME for the year it was released (so much better than Quake II) especially when you raise the resolution under preferences. The weapons are diverse and all have secondary fire. The levels are all unique, and some are really long, others not so much. It's a really long game, and you may get stuck here and there, playing it for the first time. The SOUNDTRACK is amazing, it really helps make the game breathlessly dramatic, and I wish I owned it. The enemies are ruthless, that's for sure, and also the stuff of nightmares. There are A LOT of secrets to find, and some scenes in the game are just disturbing (don't want to give too much away). Epic games really earned my respect after making this game....I swear it changed my life. It's sad it didn't receive all that much attention, it being born in the shadow of Q2 and all. This game is really a requirement for anyone who loves shooters, because this one is a classic. I spend so much of my time trying to save every single Nali I come across. SAVE THE NALI!",5.0
"The game may be old, but it's still fun as hell. The scenery and graphics are really not that bad at all. Quite a change from ""traditional"" fps games... which is definitely a good thing.",5.0
"When the day I got unreal and tried it, I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible that
game was, the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experienced
in a game, you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel heading
to a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):Vortex
Rikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali, then all goes wrong! your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj, you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel, you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real, no it's not, it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating, breath taking missions, where you fight for life to survive, collecting items
like defenses and weapons, travel through temples, facilitys, castles, bases, mountians, journey through what napali has to offer, and end up and the skaarj mothers ship, confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone! I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!",5.0
This game is a fantastic classic first person shooter. Good adventure.. By looking at the unreal price on unreal you shouldn't have to consider buying it or not.. Buy it.. thats an amazing price for a great game.,5.0
"I have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation. I have never played a game so much before in my life. I only own the N64 still for this game, I have thrown out all others. This game brings such a Movie like experience along with great missions, craft, and imperial action that I have never seen anything to its likeness. You have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a Star Wars fan.",5.0
"Well, I'm going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part. But as for the force part, I'm nonchalant. Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI. Let me just say, you'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe, and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies, which is good with me. The graphics in the game are some of the best you'll ever see on the N64. The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done. This is, I would say, the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made! Oh, and by the way, yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader. I fully recommend this game! And thats my review! Remember, ""Be a customer. Not a consumer! Period""- Jake Smithers",5.0
this is one of the best star wars / N64 games they have made i say if you have a N64 get this GAME!!! need i say more?,5.0
"I loved this game when I first played it (I still play it even today) the graphics where awsome, the sound was cool, the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it. The cheats to fly the falcon, tie fighters, naboo fighter ect all made the game even better. There is even a secret little mini game where you can control a Chicken Walker (AT-ST) and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space.

The only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets, so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a Jedi. And there is no nice video's to watch when you finally clock the game. It just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll... it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game.

Apart from that, this game rocked.. my the Shwartz be with you.",5.0
This is a superb game all around. If you love star wars you will get into this game. There are about 15 levels and some have excellent themes and graphics.  Much better than the Empire Strikes back game.,5.0
"Twisted Metal games are almost the same. Twisted Metal 3 is great,I mean it has a few flaws,but all of them do. Twisted metal 3 has wicked levels,songs,and guys.

"Well, let me get started on saying that none of the TM games match the 2nd one. NO MATTER WHAT TM2 IS THE BEST!!! But this one is up there with it. It was really hard to choose which one I like better. They both have the exciting, and adreniline, like when you are about to get killed and need to get a health power up and someone shoots you right when you are gonna grap it, lol. (you can tell that has happened to me huh?) I personally think that the first one stunk, it just didn't have what TM2 and TM3 did. You can still play as minion or sweet tooth in this one , here are the codes if you want em'
From the Main Menu, go into the password screen and type in with your control pad:
 Play as Minion-Right, Right, Right, Left, Left
 Play As Sweet Tooth-Left, Left, Left, Right, Right
Also there are some new characters too. THIS GAME IS SOOOOO HARD!!! It took me awhile to beat it. I have beat it on its hardest difficulty but that took me forever. The graphics are superb, and tie TM2. The explosion of remote bombs are awesome, They have new weapons added to the orignals from TM2. The soundtrack is awesome and never gets annoying. I wasn't even a fan of Rob Zombie til I got this game. The sound effects are awesome, with the exception of the machine guns, they are average.
All in all, I say this game rocks and keeps the legend going from the legendary TM2. Bravo 989 studios. Get this game especially if you are a Twisted Medal fan!!!",5.0
"Unreal has had me enthralled for the last year-and-a-half since I purchased a copy and started playing this enchanting game.  Unreal has superb music, great sound effects, and legendary graphics.  The weapons you  use are varied and fun to use.  You encounter very lifelike enemies with  impressive AI.  The levels are very beautiful and they run the gamut from  high-tech space ships to mystical landscapes to eerie castles and  temples.
Perhaps my only criticism is that Unreal lacks a scoring system.  I would like to be able to objectively judge my performance as compared to  other Unreal games I've played.  Wolfenstein 3-D, for example,had such a  scoring system.
I can't guarantee that everyone will like Unreal, but as  for me I will play this game over, and over, and over again!",5.0
"I have been playing PC games for one year (exactly the same amount of time I have had a computer lol)
In that time I have played these games: Abe's Oddysee, Unreal, UT, Quakes 2 & 3, Halflife, Darkstone, Wheel Of Time,  Aliens Vs Predator, and Nocturne.
Out of these ""Unreal"" is  hands down the best game that has ever graced my computer. Even competing  with games that are more recent, I have never before or since seen visuals  that one literally gasps at.
The water-world is beautiful. The pools and  fountains so gorgeous I could have died to enter this world and actually  dive into it. The sountrack is equally compelling.
The scale of the world  is enourmous, totally stunning. You feel a fleeting sense of loss as you  enter each new world, only to be replaced by more wonder.
This game comes  closer than any other game I have played to resembling a film or a book.  There is a defined mission, you want to exit this world, for despite it's  wonders it has been cursed with a cruel alien presense.
The scenery is  uparallelled, it is almost photo-realistic in places. Movement is fluent  and unrestrained, you are able to walk, run, swim, jump and crawl through  the various levels. Unreal is totally immersive.
A brief synopsis of just  a few of the levels (or worlds, each having been designed by a different  person, each has it's own distinct mood)
Some are within spaceships, both  hostile and friendly. Some in dark castles surrounded by craggy rock. Some  of the world are Nali villiages (Unreal portrays scenery like no other  game) and some in the water demon's kingdom. I must make special mention of  ""Sunspire"" which is the most indredible adventure you will ever  take, complete with amazing mirrors and reflective surfaces, and huge  lift-wells which reach literally to the skys. When you complete this level  you are on top of the world, as you await the most charming of entries into  the next world.
Throughout the game you will be helped by the indigenous  population. The Nali will steal your heart. Several times I replayed a  scene because I couldn't bear to go on knowing even a single Nali was  killed in battle.
The scope of this game is dizzying, the graphics  mindblowing. If you are imaginative and can totally supspend your sense of  reality I think you will find this a rare treat. Some people here felt let  down by the ending, which I can understand. But at least a cliffhanger  leaves a promise of more to come!
Now to wait until Unreal II hits the  shelves! (Not to be confused with UT, a seperate game)",5.0
"I recently purchased Unreal for 15 bucks. When I first got it, the game play was dissapointing due to my lack of a good video card, but after installing a Voodoo 3 3000, it plays wonderfully. The graphics are superb,  the enemies are wickedly smart, and the online playing is great! It took me  2 months to beat this game on medium, and I've just started on the Unreal  setting, which seems to be impossible.  Luckily there are commands and  cheats aplenty to help you along.  Overall, this is an excellent game, and  a real steal. If you're looking for a good FPS, don't pass up Unreal. One  shortcoming though....the ending is kind of lame.",5.0
"When the N64 system first kicked off, one of its first titles was ""Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire"".  ""Shadows..."" was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on.  It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, ""Shadows..."" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of ""Star Wars: Rogue Squadron"" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.

""Rogue Squadron"" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.

""Rogue Squadron"" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.

There is only one minor quibble about ""Rogue Squadron"".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance.

""Rogue Squadron"" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful ""Rogue Leader"" for GameCube.  ""Rogue Squadron"" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.",5.0

"The graphics are awsome. The Explsions of ties, laser blasts, and guys on the ground screaming bloody murder. From beating the bombers blowing up the capital to saving Wedge from a prision train it's the best! The controls are easy to get use to so you already now you're a pro. When you beat the game you can still play every action-packed level untill you get sick of it. Trust me, you won't get sick. Just use the force and buy it.",5.0
"Your flying at about 1000 feet above the ground when suddenly out of no where comes a tie intecpter above you with cannons blasting. You turn left, a lasor goes by which could have meant certain death. You flip, catch the imperial by suprise and shortly after he is bantha fodder( dead.) No, this isn't a movie, it's Star Wars: Rogue Squadren. This is one of the best game ever produced and my statement is what many people think. Awesome. Blast the Empire through about 20 levels of non-stop fun and great replay ability. Such classic levels include the Death Star Trench Run and even the Battle of Hoth. The controls are godly and the graphics are almost too good for a system like n-64. One of the coolest things the producers made was the medals, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum ( yes there are platinum medals, but you have to be a nut to get them.) If you can get all platinums ill give you a cookie( not very tasty.) The more medals you get the higher your rank becomes. I give this game a 200 out of 100 ( not a typo, it is that good.) [...] THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE! ( I suggest the sequel which i heard is even better for gamecube, and the game is 1 player and hi-res capability. Game runs better and looks better with hi-res.)",5.0
"If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing.  ""Rogue Squadron"" pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother).  The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.  Can't get you're hands on the new Rogue Squadron ""Rogue Leader"" for Gamecube? Pick this up to satisfy you're urge, if you do own Rogue Leader or even don't plan on getting it, pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience.",5.0
"LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.
The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.
As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.
The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them.
It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.",5.0
"This game is great for Star Wars fans! There are eleven single missions, but there are three bonus missions too. The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T-16 Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates! The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers, in my opinion over did, because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns. The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth. The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals. It doesn't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this, but ot does offer a pretty good challenge. Now go join the Rebellion and vaporize those TIE Fighters.",5.0
"Rogue Squadron.  Every Star Wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots.  Now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an X-Wing,Y-Wing,A-Wing, V-Wing, Millenium Falcon, T.I.E. Interceptor, and the Naboo Starfighter.  As you fly through over 15 missions, ranging from Tatooine to Mon Calamari, you'll earn ranks in the squardron<the highest I've gotten is Gold Leader>.  With each mission you complete, you'll earn a medal<bronze, silver or gold>and be promoted.  Do you have what it takes to buy this game, and prove you've got what it takes to be a top fighter pilot?",5.0
"Maybe it is because I was obsessed with the Star Wars Trilogy when I was younger.  I owned Return of the Jedi curtains and dressed as a Stormtrooper  for Halloween...several years in a row.  I feel a natural pull (the FORCE?)  toward Star Wars products.
Thus, I was drawn to N64's Rogue  Squadron.
Immediately, I felt immersed in the Star Wars universe with  Rogue Squadron.  It was a fantastic feeling to be able to put your X-wing  in open or closed foils mode.  I loved the feeling of blasting those AT-ATs  and TIE Bombers while trying to control my speeding A-wing fighter.  All of  this happened while I was being infused with a adrenaline-pumping John  Williams soundtrack.  Even after I beat the numerous challenges within the  game, I still go back and ""fly around.""  And that's the fun of  it.  You actually feel like you are part of the Star Wars story, and that  alone is a great experience.
As a Star Wars fan, I was not  disappointed.  As a video game player, I was amazed by the quality of  graphics (I used the expansion pack), control, and storyline.

"I'm 23 now, got the game when it first came out when I was around 12. Still the bet snowboarding game of all time. So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode, trick mode, racing series, and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended.",5.0
"What can I say except for the fact that this is one of the first 3 dimensional snowboarding games to ever come out for the home console. Now, as one of the first genres of its kind to hit the market, you can't expect this game to be perfect, but it is an incredibly fun game. Now, the only lack I have seem to find in this game is the lack of characters. There is only about five of them. The graphics are awesome, considering how old and outdated the n64 graphics are. There are a lot of levels, all of which are pretty long ones too, as well as pretty challenging. There is a huge amount of moves in this game, but sometimes, this can become a little bit tedious. It is actually kind of hard to land big combo tricks, and the controls are frustrating for the moves. In fact, I have had this game for 6 years, and still have yet to pull off the next to impossible 1080. But if you are one of the lucky ones who are fortunate enough to still have a working n64, and don't have this game, than definately add it to your collection of antique n64 games. Not much to say about multiplayer, because it does not really shine in that area. It's just an addition to the things you can do in this game besides beat it. But after you are done beating it, it becomes boring because the only thing you can do after that is try to break your records and race against your friends in vs mode. Overall, I think this is the best snowboarding game to ever come on the market, considering it is also the first. Get this game if you don't have it. It's old, but fun.

"Without any doubt, 1080 Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available.
The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal.
The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more.
The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.
1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.
1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.
Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.",5.0

"I'll preface this by saying yes I have played through FFVII on the playstation when it first came out. I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.

Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.

Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like ""Did you preorder this!!"". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to ""I wonder what happens after this..."". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.

I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before.

The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.

Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it.

Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.

In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary. To quote the back of the Playstation case.. ""What erupts goes beyond imagintion"".",5.0
"I have only RECENTLY played this game through. I did not replay it, I PLAYED IT for the first time and recently finished it. There is no nostalgia or other childhood sentiments behind my review. This is a review from someone who recently managed to find a CD of the game and played it, so this is directed towards people who have not played the game yet.

This game is beyond incredible. The storyline, the characters, the playability all get a 100/100 mark.

Positive points:
+ The plot is extremely well-written and it unfolds very nicely.
+ Character depth is a huge positive. Characters are very likable as well.
+ Most importantly, the game is SO MUCH FUN! It is a game after all, not a movie.

Negative point:
- Graphics. As I said, I am reviewing this as someone who recently played it. I know this was a revelation when it was released, but they do not compare to graphics nowadays.

Overall, I'd give this game a 97%, 2012 standards. Yes, you read that right. 2012 score is 97% for me. I don't care about graphics that much, and everything else about this game makes up for it. If it is rereleased with better graphics, there is no doubt it will get %100 in my opinion.

Final verdict: If you have not played this game, you HAVE to get it. If graphics are the most important thing for you, this game might not be for you. However, if that is the case, I suggest setting your priorities straight. This game is IMO the best thing I have ever played.",5.0
"This Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time. The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water. Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games. Multiple Movies. Toys, cards, etc based on this game.  Why was that all necessary for this one game?

It's just that DAMN AWESOME! This game has everything! Story, characters, battle system, music, humor and more! If it didn't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after? Because it was just damn awesome!

You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it, but you will keep it in your hearts forever. The amazing game play, the amazing characters, and amazing graphics. (Back in those days.)

They just can't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then. I wish they did, but they can't! It was just too well done! lol",5.0
"First off let me say that this is one of the greatest video games of all time!  I think that everyone should get a chance to play this.  For a game that released around 2000 the graphics were okay, but it was the game play and story that stood out for me.  Both were absolutely amazing, taking the classic turned based combat and building from there.  Magic was handled brilliantly with ""materia"" that you could add to your equipment.  The materia leveled as it was equipped and increased the strength of the magic associated with it as it did.

Here is the problem,  You can't get the PC game to run on newer computers without a ton of work.  In fact after purchasing it, I worked tirelessly on it for a few days without any positive result.  The fault aparently lies within the video codec required to watch movies within the game.  It is a very old codec that does not work well with newer systems.  There are several patches out there that are supposed to help with other issues as well but since I was not able to get the codec to work I am not sure that the patches would have worked either.

So, if you are running a system that is newer than Windows 95 you might have a long night in store just getting it to run properly, but if you do you will love this game.

The other alternative is a bit more pricey but I think worth the lack of hassle.  Buy a PSone and the Playstation version of the game.",5.0
"When my cousin first got this on his birthday, I was thinking "" this is just gonna be like all the other snowboarding games I've played"".  Man was I wrong!  With 8 levels of exciting, heart stopping jump, twists and turns, this is one game you don't wanna miss.  It has all the best modes, Match Race<this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer>, 2 Player, Trick Attack, Time Attack,and Contest, this is one game that won't get tiring fast.

Unlike Cool Boarders and Snowboarding kids, this  game has excellent game control, boards by lamar, and my favorite boarder,  Ricky Winterborne.

"I had been looking for final fantasy VII for about 3 years.
Awesome game. A++",5.0
"This game is fantastic, and you won't be able to put it down for a long long time.  I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do.

Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)

Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun)

Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING)

Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version)

Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do)

Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)

Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game)

The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.  I would know, because I said the same thing.",5.0
"well 1st let me say that this game has a very good replay value. ive played the psx ver of this game. and let me say getting the pc ver. is well worth getting.. say if your psx brakes (like mines did) you got the pc ver witch will last much longer.. (and you need no memory cards on top of that) but for a price.. its price is kinda high but its for a reason. replay value ;-)  & depending on what ver. of the game you get.. as far as i know there 3 diffrent ver. of this game for the pc. 1st there's the original triangle box set thats made by eidos the usa ver. 2nd theres the eidos platinum ver. witch is usa & asia vers. and last theres the EA asia pacific ver. of ff7 (witch is the one i own and yes its in english) all game patchs & mods works for all vers. of this game so there no need for worries on that part. theres only 2 probs that this game does has. the music & the gfx (graphics) well let me start with the music. if you have the psx ver of this game the music is slightly beter then the pc ver. you can get a midi synthesizer like a Yamaha XG SoftSynthesizer S-YXG50 4.0 for download on google. or a diffrent midi synthesizer of your choice.. i wouldnt use the one that comes with the game sence its kinda old.. that will make it close to the psx ver. now for the graphics is tricky if you have a newer gfx card the res for the game will look pixeled. en older gfx gard will look better then the psx ver of the game.. all i have to say is that if you love the FF games this one in my opinion is the best one ever made. parts 8, 9 and 10 comes no way near to ff7 (same go's for parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 compared to part 2 for the snes ver.) buy this game at any cost. trust me youll love this game.......",5.0
"I have played many FF games 2,3,6,7,8 and, X. From all of these 7 still ranks at the top of my list. I guess it was the story and the gameplay. its the only one that attracts me enough to play agian.

It was so good I played for almost 16 hours straight the first day I got it, oh yeah. This is one that must be experienced by all gamers, even if you're not an RPG fan, trust me you will love it.",5.0
"I am actually not a fan of video-games, but this one sucked me right in. For once what everyone says about it is true. Nowadays, the graphics aren't that great (block style) but it adds a certain charm to the game and everything is overshadowed by the amazingly complex storyline and well thought out, fully-fleshed characters.

The battle sequence is of course turn-based, which can be annoying and the constant battles when travelling IS annoying, but you have to level up somehow >^^< and its dealable. I definitely prefer the battle system over some of the newer FF games, though.

If you haven't played many videogames and aren't sure you like them or even if your a hard-time gamer with a love of fantasy and RPG - then you'll love this game! Amazing plot-twists and tons of secrets (you can play this game three times through and theres always something new that you never discovered/noticed).

I personally know many people for whom this was their first video game and they still adore it even today. A game that can keep fans hoping for more for 10 years speaks for itself!

"Final Fantasy VII is one of the greatest games of its time. Even today, it remains one of the most fun games to play. One obviously cant compare it to the latest graphics and advances, but even now it keeps a great deal of its charm. It will be remembered as a classic by gamers for years to come. It is the game that brought the Final Fantasy label to stardom among gamers in the U.S. and that led to the greater successes that followed.",5.0
"An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment. The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development.

FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle

(Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on)

FFII- wound-developable characters

(Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.)

FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills)

FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin)

FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it)

FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills)

FF7- basic weapon system

FF8- GF system

FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game

Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).",5.0
"I was a tiny 8 year old when i first watched by older brother play this game, i am now 16, having now played it myself and i still find this game as brilliant as i did back then. unfortunatly, because i'm from Europe we always have to wait longer then everybody else to get games but this was definatly worth the wait. i've now played FF2,6,8,9 and 10 and none of then are even half as good as 7 was. worth every bit of its 5 stars and a must for RPG fans.",5.0
"Much like one of the previous reviews, I have not played this game in the longest time.  However, with the sequel movie to this game coming out soon, I must once again weild the buster sword and play it again.

I have been searching my desk area trying to find the install disks for this game and have been SOL so far.  But looking at the price that the pc version is going for . . . NO WAY!  Don't spend hundreds of dollars on this game.  Do yourself a favor and do one of the three options:

1) Buy the playstation version

2) But the limited edition version of the movie for a very expensive price, but you get a bunch of extra stuff including the playstation game

3) Download the pc game.  Someone is bound to have it.

This is one of the best games ever made . . . storyline wise.  When it first came out the graphics were top notch.  If it was made like FFX, then it would be the greatest game ever, but you can't really complain when the storyline is so awesome.

Can't wait for the movie, Advent Children, to come out!",5.0
"I remember the first time I ever playied this game...all those years ago...my friend got a playstation underground demo disc of a few games...like Bushido Blade, but the one that I couldn't help but love immediately was FF7. I even remember the exciting commercial, in which they dramatized it so much that I had to buy it. But I don't regret it, on the contrary I am so happy that I bought this game and I will always cherish it. I don't let things affect me so much, but this game really got to me. To me (and should be to anyone who has played it) it is the all around ultimate RPG ever made, at least storywise. The graphics were beyond their time, at the time, but of course now they are pretty crappy. But that is actually one of the things that makes it so great. It didn't need supercomputer graphics to get you involved in the plot and make you wish you were there. The battle system is also of course outdated too, but that also adds to the retro-appeal to it I believe. It is a must have for any RPG gamer and for anyone who likes great games. Even though Gamespot only rates it at 9.3 (great by their standards) I would have rated it a 9.9, and not a 10 because it left us hanging in the end slightly. After all these years, we finally get to find out what happened in the new FF7 Compilations debuting soon (at time of writing this). I have no doubt in my mind that they will also be of absolute timeless value. But please, don't take my word for it, you must experience it for yourself to truly understand what everyone really means when the say ""The greatest game of all time"".",5.0
"This is the Final Fantasy game that took the series from it's fantastic roots on the Super Nintendo into the heights of RPG legend. This game set the standard for RPGs in 1997, a standard which it has maintained since then. The combination of adult themes, superb deep characters, a riveting storyline, and <at that time> simply unparalleled graphics made it the highest grossing RPG for the 1990s.

The story revolves around a host of memorable characters: the mercenary Cloud, his old girlfriend Tifa, a mysterious lady by the name of Aeris, and the malevolent Sephiroth (arguably the most celebrated villain in video games), the corporation Shira, and over all of this: the apocolyptic Meteor rushing towards the planet bent on destruction.

Simply put: buy this game...whether for the PC or the Playstation. Play it and realize the greatness that it is.

One of the best console games ever created.",5.0

"This is likely the best game I have ever played. Granted, it's not got the best graphics on the market today, but the gameplay is intense! I've beaten the game several times - and I still have trouble remembering things. Every time I play through, I notice several things. Also, the side quests make this a game for those looking to kill time just playing through - and those enthusiasts who 'have' to have everything. I love absolutely everything about this game, and the series as well.",5.0
"I think most fans of Rpgs and the series agree that this is either the greatest or one of the greatest RPGs ever. In my opinion this is the best game of all time too. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and get it.",5.0
"In a word:  Magnificent!  FF7 is one of the greatest games I have ever played.  It's not that FF7 does anything different than other RPG's, its that it brings everything you had ever wished for in an RPG together in the same game.  It has an engrossing plot that keeps you thinking.  The characters are presented in a way that really makes you fall in love with them and find yourself caring about their well-being as the game progresses.  The materia element of FF7 is probably the only feature that is a little ambitious and it works perfectly.  Each weapon has slots in which you equip orbs (materia) which endow the character with magical abilities or summon abilities.  There are many different kinds of materia as well, the trick is to find them all.  The battle system is one that has been seen before.  There's an ATB system in place as well as an 'overdrive' for each character similar to FFX.  Again, it works perfectly and hardly becomes repetitive.  There is at least 50 hours packed into these four disks.  There is so much to be done and so many sidequests to attempt.
The graphics are archaic by todays standards, however it is easy to overlook them.  The characters are blocky and definitely no where close to what is being presented today.  But for its time, they were above average.  Graphics does not make a game, gamplay does and this is where FF7 truly excels.
For most, this is their first Final Fantasy experience and is probably the most memorable.  Again, not that it does much different than other games, FF7 just incorporates so many different elements like story, character development, plot development, numerous and engrossing sidequests with EXCELLENT incentives for those with much time to burn, and just an overall enjoyable experience that any game has yet to duplicate.  Im sure most would agree that if a sequel were to be made out of one FF, it would be this one by far, not FFX.  The story is THAT good.  This game is highly recommended and its only like $9.  So do yourself a favor and get this.",5.0
"FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world, in fact, it is my whole world.  I play it everyday, but I was always sad, because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF 7.  But not anymore!  Now, FF 7 is out on the PC, and you have to buy it at any cost, so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time, the experience that is Final Fantasy 7, on your computer!  Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little.  I promise, you will not be disappointed.  The stunning, gut-wrenching visuals, the passionate, heart-wrenching storyline, the exciting, ball-wrenching combat system, the absolutely awe-inspiring characters...nothing could be more perfect.  You have not lived if you have not played this game.",5.0
"I must say that this is the best game i have ever played in my life.  It seriously blew me over.  I'll give an overview of the game for people just checking out reviews for the game...
~~WARNING~~ Small spoilers ahead, mostly on the first one
Storyline: 10/10 This is by far better than any movie or book i have read or seen.  Cloud Strife's life turns out to be a big joke, although he said in a long (and relatively boring) flashback that he was a Class A fighter in Soldier. He really is putting himself inhis friend's shoes. Very epic,sometimes almost made me cry.
Characters: 8/10 Wide variety of playable characters here, who you will be using all of eventually.  The only disappointment was Cait Sith, who is a big loser and a lousy combatent.
Gameplay: 9/10 WHOAH. There are so many things to do here, and i sometimes spent 4 hours or more playing this game without even realizing it.  There were many puzzles and tricks with your fingers, for example when you need to free Tifa from being suffocated by gas in an execution chamber (why, you will soon find out in the game).  And when you are finished with around 14 hours worth of gameplay, theres a whole crapload of side quests and stuff.
Graphics/Backgrounds: 7/10 for graphics, 6/10 for backgrounds.
In spite of this being one of the first games for playstation, they did an excellent job on 3-D graphics here.  Backgrounds look like paper mache, though :-P
Music: 10/10 Once again, they dish out wonderful music to stay in your head all day.  Within the first week i played this, i was humming the reactor music all day long.
Sound: 8/10 Dazzling spell sounds, pushes, pulls, drops, smacks, and so on. I ate this up.
Fighting: 9/10 Turn based combat to keep you on your toes.  If you don't move those fingers fast enough, you get hit. I like it. Only annoying part is thereare a few too many random battles, but there are a very wide variety of monsters to fight.
Script: 7/10 Although there are only text boxes, you can tell the emotion going through the voices whenever someone speaks.  Another high point.
Controls: 6/10 Takes a little getting used to when played on the PC.  Num pad only.
World map: 11/10 Very original world map, instead of a cursor and a bunch of little dots to choose from like in other games, you are an actual character walking around and entering cities.  Quite good.
Overall, i love this game.  Plenty of things to do, many side things, but don't play it on XP like i did, it messes up near the end and you need to do a whole lot of stuff to get it working again.
~~~~~83/100~~~~~ Drum roll please.........B++!!!!! yes, ++ because it probably deserves an A. I love it, buy it NOW!!!!!!",5.0
"What makes a game great?  What is it that makes a game fun? Well there are certain things that just bring all these things togather.  Final Fantasy 7 is one of those games that just brings it all in and just lets you notice the greatness.  Final Fantasy 7 has all the basic charecteristics of a good RPG.  The story line is in depth and has twist after twist that you were never expecting. Final Fantasy 7 also creates an atmosphere that captivates you and just expresses the feeling of that certain town or that area of the world.  Also Final Fantasy 7's charecters are unique and different in almost all their ways.  Each one of them has their own past and personal experiences.  This also includes their own personal sacrifices and charecter flaws (I mean come on lets face it not even heros are perfect in every aspect.)  And now for the grand finale, Sephiroth! The sweetest bad guy in the entire gaming world.  Don't want to ruin anything but you hate him when Aries dies but when he's walking through the fire at Nibelheim you have to respect him. All these aspects just make you want to replay the game over and over again and when you're playing it for the first time you just never want to put it down.  Buy it you'll love it!!!!!",5.0

Rainbow Six is a great game because you get to run around killing terrorists which is a cool thing for the problemes we are going though now i think that using M-16's and other guns in about a 10 level game is pretty cool don't ya think. Also it is not easy. you can play with a second player and you can go through a training camp where the computer theaches you how to play. this is one of the greatest games for the computer ever. i reccomened this to all action and shooting game lovers,5.0
"This has to be the second best PC game out there. First being Rainbow Six two Rogue Spear. But thats a whole other review. If you are like me you are completly sick of stupid fist person shooters like Doom with stupid fake  guns and so unrealistic where you can run into a room with guns blazin and  kill 67 people and get hit like 30 times and not die. I think that is lame  and takes no skill what so ever. Well you are in for a treat with the  Rainbow Six series. In R6 you have to carfully pick your team of specailsts  and give them their state of the art new real wepons. You have to pick the  right wepon for the right job. Like if you need stealth then you would pick  a silenced mp5 9mm. Then you plan your way through the blueprints of the  compound and get ready to take down some terrorists. You are goin to have  to forget all the things you have learned in Doom. In R6 you have to take  down the terrorists one by one and try not to attract attention so they  kill hostages or send 5 people after you. And trust me, when 5 fanatical  terrorists are rushing toward you with their  AK-47s shooting in all  directions your team will go down. And if you get hit in the arm, your aim  is horrible. If you get hit in the leg, you are as slow as a old snail. And  if you get hit in the chest or the head, mmm lets just say you won't have to  worrie about aiming or moving. Those are some of the reasons why you have  to run out today and get Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear  TODAY!",5.0
"No matter how hard I try it's just not easy to put down one of the most original games out there.  One of the things that makes Rainbow Six so unique is that it does away with the mindless blasting of guts and brains  you normally see in a first person shooter.  The game also has a lot of replay value do to the constant new mods, maps,  and weapons that come out over the internet.  It still has a few querks that make it a little weird like for example  oversensitive AI (but thats my opinion) and things that affect your aiming  like waiting for your sight to riticle (lock on).  But over all Rainbow Six is still my favorite game. (Out  of the 30 games I own)!",5.0

"This game is it! If you have ever wanted to be on a S.W.A.T. team without the boot camp work this game is for you.

Now this  game is so reaistic because if you get hit in the head your dead and if you  get hit somewhere else you probably won't survive more than 2 shots unlike  other games where you can just walk around getting shot and not die for a  while. And that's why planning your strategy is so improtant. Also once  your freind dies hes dead the whole game. So get the game cause if you  don't you are missing out on far to much fun.",5.0
Second best game EVER!! Possibly best game if you don't think Final Fantasy 3 (FF VI in Japan) is the best game ever.,5.0
"Ok, I just finished reading most of the reviews and i would like to kick some sense into the people who badmouth this game.
It swears...Ooooo...that is isignificant to the massivly godly game this is. Also i read one where it said it is not an RPG. What-The-Heck. This is under the RPG section. Do you need to be reminded what makes a game a Role Playing Game?!?!?
Also they say the main character is stupid.... COMON!!!
Cloud, an awsome name, was givin to the coolest of all RPG characters! Hes got cool hair, i wish i had could have that style....And his weapon! its SWEET i mean just look at it!
Ok....now to the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The story line is great..classic..memorable..and exciting. The dialog is funny and intersting. The amount of minigames is overwhelming and they are fun.
The battle system is outrageuosly gorgeuos and is very complex (in my opinion)
The extra characters are very cool and give a new twist to the game. And for each character there is a history that you get to expierence.
Buy this if you havent. And if you haven't you should have. And if you didn't than you should go to a doctor to find out what problems you have becuase you must have if u havent...

"This game is really the BEST. Of course, FF8 and FF10 are better, but for me this game came out-rank those games. Why? Well, FF8 has a good story, but FF7's is better. FF10, yeah it's good, most probably as FF7's. What makes this game appears bad is the graphics.
Characters 9/10
The characters are a piece of lovely work! All of them are good; Cloud the confused ex-soldier, Tifa Cloud's childhood mate and companion in 'Avalache', the Tough Barret and leader of Avalanche, quiet and cute Aerith, Foul-tounged but kind hearted Cid, the enigmatic Red XIII, the sneaky Yuffie and the mysterious man Vincent. Quite a mix for a good story.
Storyline 10/10
Man, the story makes total sense. Many twists in the story and complications make the story more exiting. The idea of personal problems to be solved is also good.
Sound 9/10
The sound is also good. I like the music, and it is as good as the sounds of FF10.
Graphics 6/10
Ok, graphics are quite good, but it is no match to FF10's graphics. On the world map and in places, they are just like dolls (which is the most i hate in this game), but in the cut-scenes and during battles they are good, really good!
This is what I hate most from people. They say that it isn't good cos of graphics (maybe they're a bit right), and because of the sound sometimes. In a game, what counts is the STORY for me, because if the graphics are good and story is very bad, that game is ruined. I can't see any defects in the sound either! So, who played knows what i mean, and who says that it sucks open your eyes well.

"The Final Fantasy series takes another rise from the new game such as FF IX and X, bu in my opinion, those are to easy.  The best Final Fantasy's are the older ones, the one's with a good plot.  Final Fantasy Tactics, III and VII are the only ones falling into this catigory.  I owned the ROM for III, but i couldn't get a PS Emulator that worked.  Finally, VII is realised on PC.  VII is perhaps the greatest game I have ever played next to FF III.  I love this game.  If I could give out more then 5 stars, I'd give it 10.  This game is the game of the centery.  Without this or III, the FF series is now worthless.  FF7 will always be a classic, now that it's for PC.",5.0
"As an avid fan of the Final Fantasy series, I have played most every game in the series. (Games after VIII yet included because I've yet to get  myself a Playstation/PS2.) Overall, the quality of the Final Fantasy series is excellent, but Final Fantasy VII is still my favorite, beating out even the later Final Fantasy VIII. Final Fantasy VII has so many great qualities, among them:
Replayability: Anybody that says that they did everything there is to do in Final Fantasy VII the first time they played through is lying. There are so many different subquests. I don't wish to spoil them, but they involve dating, chocobos, minigames and so much more. Oh, and the Gold Saucer, which I won't spoil, but there hasn't been anything like it in any of the games I've played.
Plotline: My favorite of the Final Fantasy games I've played. Adventure, love, betrayal, deceit, intrigue, it's all there and more.
Battle System: One of the most well developed of the Final Fantasy games I've played.
To respond to a couple of the listed ""cons,"" I personally did not find the interface to be all that frusturating. In fact, I find it a lot less frusturating than the interfaces of some of the earlier Final Fantasy games. It's not too difficult to figure out either and anything that may be unclear is cleared up in the provided and detailed instructions. As for the sound, anything that may be lacking in the sound department is more than made up for in the amazing music, which I find to be the most memorable and beautiful of the Final Fantasy games I've played.
Don't let its age and somewhat outdated graphics keep you from playing this game. Try it, you'll definitely find it worth your time.",5.0
"In this world, nothing is as it seems.  No one is who they say they are, and surprises lurk around every corner.  This is a wonderful game, with a rich story, great side quests, and great animation.  The evil Shin-Ra corporation has been mining Mako, an energy source that is the lifeforce of the Earth itself.  Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret, a man who's arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery.  Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER, Shin-Ra's private army.  Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER, who has been lost for many years.  Now, Cloud is working with Avalanche, and Sephiroth has resurfaced, but he is now an insane, powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world.  Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user.  This game has a great story and a great battle engine, where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia.  This is a long game, but it is legendary.",5.0
"I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews, it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc., who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!",5.0
"I really like FF series, so I bought it without hesitation. Though I noticed that same music is played in many scenes, it still can regarded as awesome game, especially in terms of it's incredible graphics. Compared to FF6, Graphics is beyond description. Also the plot is really interesting and unpredictable. If U're spending boring time recently, get this one and enjoy it.",5.0
"Wow, this is probably the best game I've ever come across!  FF7 has a great storyline, nice background music, fantastic battle sequences and short videos, and the characters are very easy to get attached to.  A warning:  This game can be very addictive! :)
  I, being the teen I am, spend a lot of time on the computer and half the time I'm playing this game.  I've beaten it 3 times and each game I play I find out new things that makes the game last longer and makes it even more fun.  There are a few subquests you can go on, secret characters to get, chocobos (those cute giant chickens you ride) to raise and race, and near the end there are a some powerful bosses called Weapons that you can challenge to defeat (if you want to).  I think FF7 is a great game overall and is really fun to play.  I would recommend this more to the teen age group due to the mild violence, language, and suggested material (sex).  I hope this review has been helpful. Feel free to tell me if it was. Good luck on the game and please don't get too addicted! :)",5.0
"Final Fantasy VII is a highly addictive, highly entertaining, and very rarely boring video game. I first played it on Playstation, and got hooked. When I lost Playstation capabilities, I immediately bought it for computer. A lot of people will say that FF8 is better. 8 is much more complicated, and it's storyline can't compete with 7's. If you like RPG type games, buy this one. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot, the comedy, the political intrigues, an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was, whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again, you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!

The lands  you travel to are amazing, the soundtrack is great...there's not one thing  I didn't like.  It's also hysterical.  It makes for an exceptional  experience..I was sad when it ended.  Kudos to Lucasarts!",5.0

"I just finished this game, and I really enjoyed it. If you like adventure games, you'll love this. The graphics are spectacular, and there are many new areas for you to explore as you journey though the game. There are many  more areas in this game than you typically find in any type of computer  game. Plus, the characters are great, and it actually has a storyline that  would stand up quite well all by itself. My only complaint would be that  some of the puzzles didn't make sense to me. At one point, you take a piece  of tape off the wall, and all of a sudden a character will talk to you who  never wanted to talk to you before. That's just one example. Many of the  puzzles do make sense, though. I still think this is a game that any  adventure gamer would enjoy.",5.0

"This game is so cool. Everything about it is just so wonderful. The game has great graphics, excellent characters, a fantastic storyline, interesting villians, cool places, and a lot, lot more. The game has a lvoe triangle between Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockheart, and Aeris Gainsborough. Cloud Strife is a merchany who thinks he is an ec-SOLDIER. But he will soon discover his true identity. Tifa Lockheart is a young woman who works at a bar. She has strong feelings for Cloud, but needs to work up the nerve to express them. She has many romantic scenes with him. She also is Cloud's childhood friend. Barret is the captain of the AVALANCHE group, and talks in slang and ebonics. He may look tough, but underneath theirs a kind hearted man. Cait Sith is a fortune teller, or so he says. You'll be shocked when you find out his real identity. Aeris Gainsborough is a flower girl from the slums. But she turns out to also be an ancient, and makes a life-altering descion, where she risks her life and dies. But you'll be shocked as what happens to her. Cid Highwind is a pilot. But he has a dream he must full-fill. How will he do it? Red XIII is a specimen, but is actully the grandson of Bugenhagen, a kind old man who studies the life of the planet. Red XIII soon finds out that his father was a lot different then he thought. Yuffie Kasragi is a their or in her words a ""Materia Hunter"". She wants some materia from Cloud and the gang. But after a certain event, could she be there for more. Vincent Valentine is a man of mystery, with a lost love. You'll soon find out about his past, his lost love, and his relations with Professor Hojo. Those are the characters. The villians are equally as interesting. The shinra is like a whole FBI gang, but we get to learn each and every one of them's personalities. DOn Corneo you'll find entertaining. But Sephiroth is the main villian, who will change everyone's life forever. Cloud and Sephiroth have a fight that await them. But first you msut adventure on a long, long journey before you take on Sephiroth. With many romantic scenes, lots of game-altering decisions, chances to go on a date with many different characters due to the choices you make, a great storyline, excellent characters, and fun action, this game is an excellent game. It also works with the struggle of finding yourself. This game will have you playing forever. The storyline is great! The game is great. this is the best game ever!",5.0
"This game is what made me love Final Fantasy - no, video games in general. It is a masterful belnd of tragedy, humor, and drama that will leave you with an extrodinarily wistful memory of the game.
The music is superb. Nobuo Uematsu absolutely has outdone himself on this one, and it really lends itself to the game. Aeris's Theme will always be remembered as one of the most beautiful pieces in any game, but there are also several lesser-known pieces that are just as intense. ""One-Winged Angel,"" for example, or ""Great Warrior."" If you have never heard the music for this game, I cannot stress enough how much you should.
The gameplay can be a bit annoying. At several points in the game, it locks up, which can be extremely annoying when you've just spent a half hour going through the sequence at the Northern Crater and it locks up during an FMV. This can be avoided, as they provide tips on the particular problems at eidos.com.
The plot is absolutely beautiful. I have heard it criticised many times, but I, personally, love it. I was a bit dubious before I played it, but afterward, I was just awed. The characters are unique and, if not developed much, at least they are interesting.
I would adivse this game above all others. However, I would advise the Playstation version more, as it seems to have fewer bugs in it. It's well worth your money if you don't have a Playstation, but you may have to put a little bit of extra effort into it.",5.0
"Final Fantasy 7 is the best FF I have yet to play.  I have played 8 and 9 also, but 7 has the best music, battle system, and junctioning system of all of them (not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything!).  Besides a couple of translation errors, this game is perfect.  I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7, 3 years ago, and I still do not know many things about it. So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you, but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it, you should buy this game, and before they stop selling it.",5.0
"This game deserves more than just 5 stars!!!This game is by far THE BEST game I have EVER played! Final Fantasy 7's storyline is wonderful! This is the first game I had for Playstation and I'm still waiting for another game to AT LEAST equal it's magnificence. The system of battling is the best i've seen. This game introduced the Limit Break very well to me. Final Fantasy 7,is the first game to really bring reality into it. From power-hungry Companies to the struggle of life living in the slums. The last thing I have to say is that:If your a fan of the Final Fantasy series and you haven't played this game,then you have no IDEA what you are missing! Play just 10 min. of it and you'll find that you've been sucked into a world of fantasy...and magic...beyond your wildest dreams....",5.0
"This is the first Final Fantasy game I have ever played, and I was blown away.  After the first 10 min. I just couldn't stop playing.  The storyline was so involved that I found myself thinking about it even when I wasn't playing it.  I also LOVED the characters.  Sephiroth was my favorite character, he is so awesome it took me forever to beat him.  I can't wait to try final fantasy 8.  I hope its as good.  This game is definately worth playing!",5.0
"I still remember the first time I played Grim Fandango. I was 17 years old at the time (was 16 when I played the Demo). What I remember more however is when I ended the game. I remember the strangest feeling I ever had upon ending a game... actual sadness. It might sound pathetic, but this is something that most of those who played Grim Fandango felt as well (if you don't believe me check the Gamespot hall of fame entry on Grim Fandango). This is a beautiful game really. The only beautiful game I have ever played. Every aspect of it shines with wit. From the art deco graphics to the Aztec inspired bebop sound track to the amazingly written script, this game stands unique and in a class of its own. The fact that it is still selling here after 10 years at almost double the price at which I bought it in 1998 is a testament to how adored it is by gamers everywhere. This is the climax of the Lucasarts school of adventure gaming and unfortunately, the last statement of a genre that is dearly missed. I recommend playing this game very highly. I almost envy you if you have never played it. There is nothing really quite like playing it for the first time around. Enjoy!",5.0

"This is the EPITOME of graphic adventures. No other game has even come close to GRIM FANTANGO when it comes to humor (of all shades and shapes), inventiveness, delicious irony, creative graphics and plain good-ol' FUN!!

This is a 10-year old game mind you - yet, it retains its freshness as any true work of art. THIS IS HOW COMPUTER GAMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN - and not the pathetic cookie-cutter products of mega-corporations working in-tandem with GX-card companies...

Your character (hilarious and lovable Manny Calavera) is already...dead when you start. In fact he has been dead for some time, stuck in limbo, trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise. Guess what: corruption is not limited just to this world. And where there is corruption, there is oppression; and where there is oppression, there is always a revolution brewing...

Realizing he is being duped, Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED. Immersing noirish atmosphere, detailed art-deco settings, fast Bogartian dialogs - with a subtle ironic frosting.

WARNING: There are known problems with today's faster processors. So, unless you have a really old system running Win98 you will need the WinXP PATCH (otherwise you will not get past the crane scene).

WITH THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!!!",5.0
"This is without a doubt one of the best games ever made - adventure or otherwise. It is fun, amusing, original, colorful, and challenging without being annoying. The only games that came close to it may be the Monkey Island series or The Last Express. The game is beautifully designed, with unforgettable characters, amazing landscapes, and reminds me of being inside a really well-written movie. Sadly, LucasArts stopped making games like this, a loss for the world.",5.0
"I think this game is simply the best game I've ever played. I think about it, after the fact, all the time. The visuals are gorgeous. The voice acting is superb. The soundtrack is good enough that I actually listen to it by itself! No other game has influenced me so much as this. Do whatever it takes to play this game.",5.0
"Although still a gamer (or at least an interested former gamer), I have been sceptic about games as of late. Almost no game has managed to captivate me at all for the last 5+ years, and that is tragic. But I don't give up on the medium, largely because of this game. Grim Fandango is proof that video game design can be an art, and as video game art, this is a masterpiece.

Of course, Grim Fandango is really only 1 part game, and 5 parts story. If you have played any Graphic Adventure game before, especially one by the fantastic Tim Schafer or his contemporaries Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman, than you should know the gameplay already. If you haven't, then it is going to seem weird, ungame-like, and maybe even boring. What makes this game so great is that it is really a vehicle to drive the story more than anything else. With the fantastic music, graphics (for it's time), voice acting and dialogue (by far the best dialogue in any game before or since), you could be more than entertained watching this as a movie. However, it is more than obvious that an interactive game is the very best way to tell this story, and all the characters, conversations and plot twists are designed to take advantage of your interaction with them.

Replacing the point and click style that dominated the adventure game genre since it replaced the text adventure style, this game uses a new keyboard based interface. It is the same interface (almost) later used in the (dissapointing) fourth Monkey Island game. While it is better used in this game, it still isn't as good as the old mouse system. If there is any complaint to make about this game, it is that.

I recomend this game to anyone. If you haven't played an adventure game before, this may turn you on to the genre... which might actually be misleading, because no other game gets as good as this one. Adventure game lovers would have already played it, chances are, unless they are old fogeys who haven't played it because other new adventure games have been sub-par. If this is you, I understand your frustration. But this game is a beacon of light in the dying genre. It was the game engineered to save it from extinction, and it should have worked. But it didn't, and now it is more like a swan song.",5.0
"Not only is Grim Fandango a really fun computer game, but it's a work of art. I really can't say enough about this game; the art direction is phenomenal, the voice acting is incredible, the soundtrack is superb, it's hilarious and it's genuinely intriguing. Unlike many PC adventure games, Grim Fandango will keep you coming back repeatedly to see all the things you might have missed in previous playings thanks to the huge attention to detail. The puzzle and problem solving aspect isn't terribly challenging or unique, but that's not what makes Grim great, it's the way it plays like a movie, even more so than most games in the genre. Every 'stage' and environment in the game is exciting and relevant to the gameplay so you're almost never walking back and forth pointlessly through the same environment for hours on end. But even if you did it wouldn't be that much of a problem because most of the time you'll find yourself enthralled by the architecture and character design.
Anyway, the game is amazing and (in my opinion) the standard (maybe even the high point) for the adventure genre. Hopefully the appreciation and cult following will continue to grow until one day we might get to see more of Manny Calavera.",5.0

"You awake in a fairy tale world in a forest of faires, in front of you is the pinnacle of a hero of time, a ordinary child named link, thrown into a story of magical tragedy, love and war, fighting with swords, boomerangs and countless items in this open world rpg, adventure game. a classical magical artistic story of dark hope. From the moment i entered the tree, my deepest childish heart was immersed by The spooky chilling song of wonderus oblivion,  played with a dida jiu, envoks the dark gothical environment of smokey earth, a hidden sign of our own earthly desires and self destruction. the rest of the music is amazing and fits each place perfectly. I really like the hyrule field song of mystery and adventure. You gather items such as slingshots, bombs, magic spells, and the sword of time. This allows you to go to times and alter the other time to your advantage. The sun and moon take turns with night and day as you run through a beautiful hyrule field, a fire mountain and other magical places.  A legend of revolutionary gaming experience, exploration, story telling, magical youthfulness, a pioneer of open world environments with realistic time cycles.

Final Fantasy VII is hands down a classic and the plot and characters by themselves lifted the game to a level above all other RPGs I've played.

Really recommended, I wish there was a part II.",5.0
"I don't go for adventure games, personally.  Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it?

Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have.

Especially if you're already dead.

That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?).

Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years.

Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client.

And that's when he gets in over his head.

The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake.

Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.  He's waiting for you...",5.0
"Grim Fandango has a very retro feel, sort of like Casablanca with an Art Deco Aztec twist. The game centers around Manny Calavera who is attempting to stay honest and make sense out of a Hispanic day of the dead afterlife which has been corrupted by those who control that afterlife for their own gain. All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked. I've tried a lot of the adventure games and they all have their flaws. But Grim Fandango comes as close to perfect as any game ever will. The controls are a little irritating but not as much as some newer games. This is the best adventure game out there and I strongly recommend that you try it.",5.0
"This is one of those games where you wish you could actually *be* in the game as one of the characters.  I still load it up  and play it again every few months; and I first played it several years ago.  The storyline is one of the best, the voice-acting is perfect, the concept is fresh and original, and the graphics are still quite good even for being several years old. I keep hoping there'll be a sequel or movie made of this game; but I don't know how it could be done and retain the charm this game has.  It takes a long time to play, but you never get tired or bored--the story is so engaging and the characters so interesting that you keep wanting to see what's going to happen next.  The first time I completed this game, I just sat back silently for a couple of minutes, then said ""D**n...this game is going to be a Classic!"".  Oh, and the music is GREAT.  If you want to play a game that will honestly entertain, surprise and delight you, look no further.

And if anyone that worked on this game reads this, KUDOS TO YOU--I hope life entertains and satifies you as much as the joy of experiencing this game brings to me.  Thank you.",5.0
"Such a shame, they just don't make games like this anymore... In what is probably their last classic adventure game, LucasArts returned to the things that made Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max and Monkey Island - the games I loved so much as a kid - unforgettable classics. Grim Fandango is a fun game with a good story, hilerious dialogue and extremely lovable characters. The graphics and gameplay are of course modern (though the four year old graphics look outdated in today's standards, it's still great and a perfect look for the game) but the rest of it is completely in the style of these great oldies. The gameplay and interface - strictly keyboard-oriented - may take a few minutes getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's just as comfortable as the mouse control of Sam & Max. The game is meant mainly for young adults - the humor is sophisticated, and the puzzles are much more difficult than those in the classic LucasArts adventures (but not so difficult as to become frustrating). If you loved those games when you were younger, then Grim Fandango is a must-have.",5.0
"If they made more games like this, I'd be a pauper. Intelligent, funny, easy to use, easy to solve, and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking, gorgeous, well-written, and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed, so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble, though.",5.0
"Words really can describe how wonderful this game is. The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics, it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about. This is a must have!",5.0

"This game is very addictive with an AWESOME storyline, a load of GORGEOUS  FMVs(Full-Motion Videos), and PLENTY of hours of play! The best part  besides the awesome graphics and FMVs is the storyline. It is so good that  about 10 minutes into the game you are deeply and personally involved and  you will be happy, mad, sad or whatever when something happens in the game.  The game's characters and storyline are SO detailed and awesome that I  still can't believe I had played a game this good! It really grabs you.  Man, you will be wanting sequels!!!

"I've never played the Playstation version of this game and this was my  first time playing any sort of Final Fantasy game.  I originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world,  the characters, and the dozens of things to do.
You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world.
I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns.
This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons?
The story was amazingly detailed, the characters  were all unique, and the game pulled no punches.  I highly reccomend it.",5.0
"Final Fantasy 7 is definitly a good game.  i should know, being the game freak that i am.  I play comp. games so much, that i beat this game 11,  count em, 11 times.  i've gone through every nook and cranny in this game.  ive beat ALL the weapon monsters (Ruby(hardest boss in the game)emerald,  diamond and ultimate) and collected  3mastermagics/3mastersummons/3mastercommands.  Trust me.  I know a lot  about this game.  After that long, i am still hooked to it, even though i'm  workin on ff8 right now.  You want to know what i think? i saw this game,  and i was hooked from the start.  GET IT and you become as much of a game  freak as me! :)",5.0
"Stunning. Simply stunning. FF7 is a gaming icon.
What's there to like? A lot. For a start, the setting, a world where magic and technology exist on an equal footing and which features some of the best settings yet and a  truly epic world. The storyline is excellent, putting many other games,  movies and even novels in the shade. The game has a knack for setting you  up so you think you've got the situation sussed, then shaking things up  radically. The characters are sympathetic, even most of the villains, and  there's more to all of them that meets the eye.
The game system is  heavily biased towards combat, which is all right, since it does it so  well. With sweeping camera angles and beautiful SPFX, you want to get that  new spell or summonned monster as much for the wonderful effects as the  effect it has. The summoned monsters in particular warrant a mention,  mainly because they're so wonderfully over the top in the best tradition of  anime, including a huge steampunk thing that surges out of the ground and  blasts the enemy and a dragon which appears in orbit and fires an energy  beam powerful enough to flatten a mountain at your enemies.
Bad  points...a few but nothing which really spoils it. Genuinelly challenging  fights are few, most notably in the mid part of the game, the menu system  is cumbersome (not changed much from the console, it seems) and the  character graphics can be a bit crude out of combat (close up, they look  like they're made of Lego) But nothing serious. Buy this, if you haven't  already. You won't regret it.",5.0
"When I first installed the game I was ready to see some playstation all over the place. Boy oh boy was I wrong! As I got farther in the game I felt as though I was there talking with the charecters, and with battles! God,  I've never seen an rpg fighting situation/layout so well put together  before in my life! Whether I was casting Cure 3 or letting loose the fury  of Knights of the Round I was dazzled and amazed by it's effects! I must  say that Final Fantasy 7 is by far the best game/rpg ever!",5.0

I really like playing this game and I also like trying to solve  the puzzles in this game. If you don't have Grim Fandango, get it because  it's that good.",5.0
"First, you have to understand that I do not generally enjoy, at all, this  sort of wander around, solve the puzzle sort of game. But in watching my  son play, I was hooked. The designers have created a great blend of the  familiar and the unexpected. Heck, you just don't see film noir aztec/art  deco adventures in the land of the dead all that often. Superior story, fun  soundtrack, and visuals that are every bit as engaging (in their own loopy  way) as Riven all contribute to a game that is...well, here's the kicker  for me. My son has long-since worked through the whole game, but he still  gets it out regularly, pops it in, and ""watches"" it just like any  of his favorite movies.",5.0
"I never realised how much Grim Fandango had taken over my life in the short space of time that I had been playing it until I came to uninstall it a bit ago...  The short Mexican guitar trill brought back all of those  memories...
At first I wasn't sure whether or not to buy Grim.  It had  good reviews, nice packaging, but sounded a little silly...thank god I did  in the end.  Even my sister enjoyed playing it, and she doesn't like  Adventure games! With beautifully rendered back drops, cut scenes which  will leave you drooling, real-time characters who really seem alive (!) and  a wonderful change of atmosphere for every year, Grim Fandango is a peak of  pure pleasure. If you half want to buy this but aren't sure, I will promise  you now that you WON'T be disappointed! Oh, and the game seems to last for  ever, as well, and the story line run up to the end will have you on the  edge of your seat until the shocking climax shoot out!",5.0

"This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. It should have experienced more success than it did. LucasArts does a great job putting out hilarious adventure games and this one (in my opinion) is right up  there with Monkey Island.
The puzzles are very well integrated with the  story line. The characters are great. Glottis is truly hilarious. At a  couple points during the game I found myself laughing so hard I had tears  in my eyes. This game is very classy and very well designed. If I had to  make a complaint, it's that the game ended to soon.",5.0
"Grim Fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology. I'd give it a 4 and a half if i could. The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements. Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing. You follow the character Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the dead, guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible. For some reason, Manny is denied any premium clients. Whos behind all this? Find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow, to the edge of the world and back again. Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir-ish music immerse you in the atmosphere. Clever interface and variable controls are great. A very involving game. Not too long not too short. Humor and wit are weaved through every scene. In conclusion, film noir style, surreal visuals, toe tapping and ensuing music, gripping story, charming characters, and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fans.",5.0
"This is the best adventure game today, hands down.  In the classic, film noir story you play Manny Calavera, a suave travel agent in Purgatory, just trying to make an honest living selling souls a travel package to Heaven.  This is made more and more difficult by his loudmouth boss Don Copal and  his scheming rival Domino Hurley (who is portrayed as the quissentessial  Chicago mobster type).  After their last bogus client, Manny tries to get a  new client and steals one, Mercedes Colomar, from Domino, with the help of  his driver buddy Glottis.  Cheerful, big, bumbling and orange, this lovable  demon is the comic relief of the game.  Beautiful, smart, sweet and rich,  Mercedes should be offered top notch travel to Heaven, but for some reason  is not.  Then, she dissapears and Manny is fired.  Domino starts to  converse with a mysterious, evil stranger, and Manny finds a heroic rebel  who suspects that the Travel Agency's motives are less then honest.
  Beautiful, 3D yet cartoonish graphics, a lush Jazz score  wonderfully compliment a hilarious cast of characters.  Slimebag lawyers,  treacherous women, a Russian cyclops, hyped up Coat-Check ladies and  deadly, poison shooting guns make for a dramatic, hilarious, cool and fun  play.  If you get stuck, contact the walkthrough on [...]  because some puzzles simply don't make sense.  You will fall in love with  the characters, with perfect voices and faces.

"The only game that is better for PC or any system is its newer version which has better graphics. I would recomend either game but I especially like FF7. The stortline is much more clear. The only rag is that the ending  movie in FF7 doesnt contain the optional charecters(Yuffie and Vincent)The  plot is the main charecter Cloud Strife is haunted by his past by another  SOLDIER member Sephiroth. and the 9 charecters(Cloud, Barrett,Tifa,  Aeris,Red XIII aka Naniki, Cait Sith, Yuffie, Vincent, and Cid) try and  defeat. Thereare many fun mini games and Exclusive American monsters, also  the game has GOLD chocoboo's. I would recomend this game to any one age 11  and older.",5.0

"I sorta just started playing so I'm not very far but so far i reccomend it to anyone that likes a good RPG. It gets you so involved... you'll say: I'm only gonna play for an hour or so... and next thing u know 3 hours have  passed. It's so engrossing. The only problem is the save system where u  gotta be at a checkpoint... i like to save whenever i want. Other than  that, I'm thrilled with my decision to spend the measly $20. Cheaper than  on PlayStation, and you get the same game. Just buy a controller for your  comp. It's worth it in the long run. I think mine was only like $10... and  it's identical to the PSX one. So, if you don't wanna buy a PSX but you're  dying to play FF7, spend the $30 total instead of the $130 you spend on the  system and the game. I'll be sure to check in with you guys and rate it as  i progress.",5.0

I say it's worth the money, unless you feel it's to pricey then just get the 3DS version that's also $20 at Walmart. My only complaint is that it looks a little blurry on my TV.

"I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango.  An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did.
Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday.
Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango.
The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another.
The things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone, this would be it.",5.0
"My wife and I got this game because we had heard so many good things about it.  It has turned out to be a hilariously fun game that has given us hours of fun together.  THE GOOD: 1) The graphics are great!  It is like  playing in a dreamland made of modern Aztec architecture.  2) The way your  can manipulate the 3-D character is a fresh approach that is easy to learn.  Just use the keypad to walk, run, rotate, talk, pick up things etc...  (This  makes the game much more enjoyable than games like Riven where you just get  screen shots.)  3) The story line is funny, creative and a blast to follow  along and play!  I found myself eagerly anticipating the opportunity to  explore more of this world.  4) The non-player characters add another  dimension of fun.  I couldn't believe how many times I found myself  laughing out loud at what they said and did!  THE BAD: 1) Like all games  of this nature it eventually gets to the point where it is hard to play  anymore because you either can't solve the next puzzle, or you are tired of  trying.  We did find some free tips online though, and that made it so that  we could progress through the game.  2) We are running it on a 366 MHz  computer without a video card.  This is fine except for the times where  there are a lot of moving graphics and animation.  Then our computer slowed  down some, but this only happened about 10% of the time.  If you have a  better computer I doubt if you will have any problem.  OVERALL: Sure, the  characters smoke, but so does most of the world, and this second hand smoke  won't even bother you!  This game is so much fun that if you overlook  playing it you will be missing what we consider the most enjoyable puzzle  game yet made!",5.0
"Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution.  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games.
True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout.
If I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  ""choose-an-ending"" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized.
Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available.
Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.",5.0
"Wow. This has to be the most amazing adventure game ever created, even better than **shock** Monkey Island?  Once you get involved in the game, you can't escape it's grasp.

"As was expected this game kicked butt. You, Cloud Strife, are on a mission to save the world from Shinra, the Mako sucking corporation. However, this is not the true plot of the story. That will be left up for you to find...  The battle system is very unique. Every player has a charge counter. When  that fills after a few seconds, its your turn to do your stuff, whether  it's your attack, limits, magic, summon, deathblow, or sense. I'll explain  those later. The plot is so thick and rich its wonderfully interesting.  Limit Breaks are special moves each character uses. Magic are spells like  Fire,Ice, and lightning. Summon are moves that use demons to attack like  Ifrit, Shiva, Levithan, and Bahamut Zero. Deathblows are powerful attacks.  Sense is a move that tells you what the enemy is and what it's like. I  could go on and tell you about the Materia and chocobos but heck that would  take ad infinitum. I'll just lay out some characters you'll get. Tifa  Lockheart, Aeris Gainsborugh,Barret Wallace, Red XIII, Cid Highwind, Yuffie  Kisaragi, Cait Sith, and Vincent Valentine. P.S. Any question e-mail me at  So2smd@aol.com",5.0
"Final Fantasy 7 is the BEST game ever created in my opinion. The storyline is nice and comlicated and the materia system is amazing. I love all the veicles, but my favorite is the Highwind. Everything about the game is  amazing, from the graphics to the awesome battle music. The characters are  well devoloped and each have a very different role in the storyline. The  only thing bad about the game is that the music in the computer version  isn't very good. This problem isn't there in the Playstation version (the  version I have) however. This game is THE game to  get!",5.0
"Alright, Final Fantasy 7.  What a game, but why?  Well first of all, it is in one of the oldest RPG families around.  FF's have been with us for what seems like forever, and has given people a lot of time to get hooked on the  wonderful stories and original gameplay.  But this review is on the 7th not  those others so here's the facts:
 It's a ropleplaying game (RPG) And  so being is very story driven.  Picture this, you are in a world both very  different and very similar to our own.  The world is basically ruled by a  huge company (Shinra) which gets it's kicks from draining the earth of it's  life-force, and using that energy to power, well everything (here  money=kicks).  Around you are bizzare contraptions that are mechanical in  nature, but run on mystical energy, giving the game a kind of mix of sci-fi  and fantasy.
 You start as Cloud, and elite fighter belonging to  SOLDIER (a special forces unit of the Shinra company) turned butt-kicking,  huge sword weilding, mercenary, who really only cares about getting a buck  or two to keep food on the table.
 Enter AVALANCHE a sort of mis-guided  Greenpeace (in this context that is a VERY loose analogy) that is using  terrorist methods to stop Shinra from killing the earth.  You need money,  they need to blow things up, so hey, your hired.  And so it starts, but let  me tell you the plot almost immediately starts taking some pretty wild  turns, making it one of the most immersive games I've ever played.
  Yeah, it's classified as an RPG, but there honestly is so much more.  I'm  sure you've heard that ""rushing"" through it you get 30 hours of  gameplay.  That is totally plot, with a little leveling in between, but  there is just SO much stuff to do the only reason you would want to rush  through like that is if you are making a walkthrough or something for the  game.  You get to participate in tons of little side games that really are  games in themselves.  I remember spending literally HOURS just trying to  get the best Chocobo so I could win the racing game.  The graphics are just  amazing.  Really stunning.  The cutscenes fit perfectly into the plot, with  almost no loading times, and when it ends, you are right where it left you.  And, perhaps best of all, ever get to the end of a game for an  anticlimatic sequence?  Feel cheated by the company for not giving the end  some of the magic the rest of the game had?  Well, I take back what I said  about only rushing through the game for one thing, you'll want to see the  end of this one over and over.  In the end a beatiful game, in story,  graphics, character development, and pure fun this will have you hooked the  moment you go bomb your first Shinra building.  Perhaps the one thing I  could complain about is the music, they could have done better than midi,  but hey, I guess its sort of nostalgic to all the other older FFs.  Good  luck, and may the Mako energy be with you.",5.0
"I am an avid Final Fantasy player, having been a fan since Final Fantasy 1 for the NES, and having played each game since, including Japanese versions not released in the U.S. Final Fantasy VII certainly was no  disappointment.
Some other Final Fantasy games, such as 2 and 3 (Jap: 6),  have better plots than VII; however, VII was certainly very close, and far  exceeds the standards of most other RPGs. The plot in VII is more  complicated than in its predecessors. Hordes of details are tightly  interwoven in a magnificent latice. However, there are some scenes and  characters that I will describe, for lack of a better word, as stupid.  People who have played the game may recall Cate and the funhouse or Don's  House of Love.
The graphics are superb, and the game engine is great.  Battle scenes are realistic, the scenery is beautiful, and well-rendered  full-screen MPEG videos are seamlessly integrated into the game. My only  regret is that the controls in a 3D environment are a bit more challenging,  especially if you're using the keyboard.
I can't say I like Materia or  the new magic system, whereby a person knows only the magic spells  corresponding to the limited number of Materia he or she equips.  Furthermore, the game isn't nearly as challenging; I played it all the way  through with only two deaths, and there are places to save the game all  over the place, which means that even if you do die, you have as many  chances as you'd like. The game doesn't necessitate purchasing any new  equipment; the gear you find along the road will get you all the way  through if you're good at battle tactics.
For the benefit of people who  haven't played a Final Fantasy game before, I'll describe the basic  workings. The game is an epic adventure centered around one character, but  including about 7 others. It requires no coordination to play, since your  success in turn-based battle depends on your strategy, not your timing.  There is a good balance between the storyline and battle scenes, so you  should enjoy the game regardless of which you like best. The game is really  something, and it's fairly cheap. If you play one Final Fantasy game, make  it this one. If you play two, get a Super NES and play 3 (6 in Japan) as  well. Then play 8 or 2, or see if you can get your hands on 5.",5.0
"This truly is a great game. Granted, FF8 is better in graphics, but it can get really confusing when you need something right then and there. Also, when I loaded the game, the videos were upside down! I went to eidos snd fixed the problem with a patch. NOW, the videos are  great, the midis run smoothly, and the gameplay is excellent.",5.0
"I really like this game, though once I got to, the cave, at Red XII home, My battle bar, got garbled, and When they spoke they were all garbled aswell, though I made it threw alright, and have found no problems with it.  Except, that if you push anybutton, while a movie is playing your computer  can't handle it well, and may crash, but you could exspect that from a P.C  game. Also, The graphics are good, the story line, and The battles are the  coolest, It is just a great game. Also I have a question for anyone out  there that can answer it for me. THe question is : The girl Aeris, is named  Aeris, in the battles and in the book, but, on posters, I have seen they  call her AERITH, okay confused or what?  Weird, is it short ofr Aeris or  what, help!  If anyone seen this, could you tell me, or if you know why or  have a idea, please tell me, it is just baffled me?",5.0

"This was definitely the best game I have ever played! The music was great for the locations, the voices were great, and the game was sad, funny, and entertaining. I would give this ten stars if I could!",5.0
"This game is so amazing.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  Every character in the game has their own distinctive attitude and way that you can attach to.  Wait... did that make sense?  Anyway, go get this game  cause it's just amazing.",5.0
"This game was truely the best adventure game I have played and I've played a few. The story is brilliant, the characters are so great that you actually miss them when you stop playing and the graphics and sounds are  top-noch as well. The only downside of the game is that it ends. I can  recommend this game to anyone.",5.0
"This is not just another game ! it is much more than that: the story, the music, the characters and the design are just PERFECT. The only regret i have is that there is not much chance for another game like it. The  graetest game ever !",5.0
"This is great game, the story is engaging, the puzzles fit in nicely with the story so that they don't seem like puzzles, and the music is absolutely fantastic. I stopped playing the game and just listened to the music at  some points. I loved the characters too, Manny, Lupe, Glottis, and all the  rest",5.0
"This is the best adventure/puzzle game I have played.  It is more compelling than Riven because it has heart to it.  It leaves you with feeling and interest in the memorable characters.  The puzzles are  pointless at times, but less so than other games.  Best music ever in a  game.  There are great characters and sweet, funny, and entertaining  moments throughout.",5.0
"Once I started playing 'Grim Fandango', I could not stop! This is the most creative adventure game I have seen in a long time. Not only is the storyline captivating, the attention to detail in this game is very  impressive. As a fan of both art deco and film noir, I found 'Grim' to be a  total delight!  Some of the clips which move the storyline along are so  well done, I could have sworn I was watching a movie. I have even played  'Grim' multiple times after completing it just to watch those clips  again!
My only (minor) complaint about this game would be that there were  one or two puzzles which were just about impossible; I have not come across  anyone who was able to pass these difficult challenges without consulting a  walk-through. However, if you're looking for an engrossing, dazzling game,  this is the one!",5.0
"I've played every adventure game from Zork to Riven, and I must say that Grim Fandango emerges as the leader of the pack. Most games aren't fun after you've beaten them, but I find myself returning to GF again and again. The graphics are stunning; the puzzles are challenging without being  too frustrating or distracting you from the story, which is as interesting  as a good detective movie. The voice acting- as always in LucasArts games-  is superb. The music is so good I'd buy a CD of the soundtrack. The  gameplay is immersive and fairly easy to master, except for the frustration  involved in using just about any of the elevators in the game.  After a  session of GF, I find myself speaking with a Latin accent and wanting to  call people ""Manny"" and ""Meche."" The entertainment  value of GF is worth much more than $.",5.0
"The plot of the game may seem odd, but it grows on you.  The puzzles can be annoying at times, but most Role-playing games are that way.  It has an excellent storyline, great graphics, and great dialogue.  Its a ten in my  book.",5.0
"I love this game! Excellent storyline, great graphics, sweet sounds, and other cool stuff. gotta love da chocobos!  Sure, you need an ok computer, but who doesn't have a great computer these days?  A must have for all  final fantasy and RPG fans. And even if your not one, play it!",5.0
"I first played The Legend of Zelda not long after it was released. Best Christmas gift ever! I do not think there is a single negative thing I could say about this product. It has the classic adventure story: traveling across far out lands to save the princess, all the while discovering yourself along the way. When you are not in dungeons or fighting evil characters, you can do a lot of fun things like explore towns, go horseback riding, archery, hurt chickens and then try  to avoid their gang attack, play your ocarina, go fishing and see how large of a fish you can catch, etc. There is so much variety in this game that it is impossible to get bored. Also, the music in this game is PHENOMENAL. Did you know that there is a Zelda soundtrack you can purchase? There are also some guide books and online walk throughs if you find yourself a little stuck and are in need of some helpful hints.

Price wise, I have found Zelda games for less via Ebay, but you usually have to bid on them. Unless you want to pay several hundred dollars for a ""new in box"" game, expect the cartridge to look used from being well loved over the years.",5.0

"If the game defines multiplayer, this is the one.

Other than outdated graphics and poor single-player experience, it revolutionized first-person shooter with slick controls, intense difficulty, and fun multiplayer with up to 4 players and more than 10 maps and characters to choose from.

GoldenEye 007 was a blast from the past. The best movie-license game of the 007 franchise!",5.0
"Goldeneye... Oh Goldeneye... IS THE BEST CONSOLE FPS I HAVE EVER PLAYED!
Perhaps you think that I played it in 1998, and nostalgia has tainted my objectivity forever.
NOPE! I was given this game as a gift in 2007. And I was blown away.
Here are what stood out to me as the best features:

1) I love the controls. Playing fps on consoles can be rough, but not this one. I love the feel of how you can sprint by moving diagonally. The way that Rare collapsed aiming, crouching, and leaning out of cover onto one button, while maintaining precision and intuitiveness is simply genius. There are a plethora of configuration options, which is rare in console fps games to this day. Setting 1.2 ""solitaire"", in particular, feels amazing. Rare leveraged the odd shape of the N64 controller into a strength. You feel like you are really holding a handgun. When I play modern dual analog shooters, I actually MISS Goldeneye's tasty game feel.

2) The animation in this game is outstanding.  For one, there are a TON of character damage animations. Shoot an enemy in the hand, and they fumble with their weapon, clutching their hand trying to stop the bleeding. Shoot them with a shotgun in the chest and they will be blown of their feet, tumbling back into what appears to be a dead heap, until you see them struggle to get back up onto their feet, gravely wounded but still alive. Shoot them in the head and OOPS! You realize you just barely missed when you see the enemy's hat fly off (this is my favorite animation). Characters dodge and roll, raise their hands up in surrender, and do many, many more things. This is just the tip of the iceberg; the variety, detail, and personality of these animations is to this day rarely matched.

3) The levels are phenomenal. Locations are diverse and fully realized, and many landmarks are easily recognizable from the Bond films. There are no corridors or rails here. Levels feel like real spaces, and you are given the freedom to explore to your hearts content. Typically there are several routes available to the player, with plenty of secrets and hidden areas along the way. Scenarios are also varied and interesting, ranging from stealthily infiltrating Soviet labs, to running frantically alongside moving vehicles using them as cover, to rolling through dilapidated Russian cities in an OP tank. There is no filler. Every level is distinct from the last. The difficulty settings deserve specific praise. Harder difficulty levels don't turn enemies into bullet sponges. Instead, more challenging goals are given to the player. It is shocking that more games do not handle difficulty in this way.

Are their flaws? Sure there are. The frame rate is not very high, hovering around 30 fps. I wish there were more types of enemy soldiers to fight. In screenshots the blurry, shoddy textures are an eyesore. Character models look blocky and awkward. But to me, these flaws are forgivable and do not overshadow the game's many strengths. In motion the game is beautiful. Skilled players glide through the environments like figure skaters, sprinting diagonally like a pro. Enemies move and react to the player with charm and personality. This game makes you feel like James Bond, the action accompanied with exciting, swinging spy movie music - Truly spectacular.

In summary. Goldeneye 007 does hold up to this day. Even if you weren't around in '98 to play it in its prime, you should get this game.",5.0
Great product. Works flawlessly. Love this game.,5.0
I grew up on this game and it was the best game ever. The graphics are crap but the gameplay is amazing and i never got bored. The reason why these prices are so high is because these games are no longer made brand new so they are rare to get new so they are valuable if you do not want to pay the huge ammount of money for a brand new copy and get a used copy it works the same.,5.0
Got here a day early from the opposite side of the states in good condition.. Couldn't be more happy. Thanks for the melted candy too by the way.,5.0
"I'm so sorry for writing this late. I bought this on March 10, as a gift for a friend. I needed to get it, ship it out by the 15th, so she could get it by the 21st. The estimation said the 15th so I wasn't sure she was going to get her gift on time. But the game showed up after 2 days and I tested it and it worked great! I even changed the save files so it said ""Happy Birthday"" and she loved it. Thank you so much!",5.0
Thanks for the sweet game! works perfectly,5.0
"This is one of the greatest games of all time. Much has been said and will continue to be said
about this passage in the Zelda story. What I really want to focus on is how awesome the battle mechanics are in this game, it works so well and rarely any games of modern era can even touch it's sword play mastery. It's so satisfying to fight bosses and sword wielding enemies.
Everything about this game is legendary, the music, the characters , the story, it just leaves you wanting more. This is what fantasy adventure is about, standing the test of time and continuing to teach us all something great.
I can't wait to revisit this on the Nintendo 3ds version. It's a complete remaster from what Ive seen.",5.0

There is almost nothing to say that is bad in this game, other than a few puzzles which could have done with a bit of mapping out more or showing us more.

"This game following the success of the movie is one of the greatest games of all time. It set the bar for games like call of duty and battlefield today. In fact alot of games still copy off of goldeneye 007, including the remake which was horrible. This game had 12 missions I believe and 4 player co-op split screen. Every level was made perfectly, and it also featured tons of objectives and weapons.

I remember the one hit kill golden gun and the awesome body armor spread throughout the levels. The music was top notch and the emeny Al would shoot you on sight. Every mission followed the movie with 3 different difficulties and different objectives parameters to complete. When you paused the game bonds watch would come up with and uptempo beat to it. It was one of the coolest features in the game. There was also other characters in split screen like odd job, mayday, and jaws you could play with too.

Pierce Brosnan was one of my favorite James Bond actors featuring in 4 films in the 90s. They are all action packed and I'd advise you to see them if you haven't already. They also made a game from the world is not enough but didn't get the great reviews this game did. I could only imagine how this game would be if it was released today with HD graphics 1080p! It's crazy how much this game is now, so if your one of the lucky ones to still own it please don't sell. If you are one of the ones who have never played it, I'd advise you to find someone that will let you play it. This is and epic classic people they will never make another game like this ever again.",5.0

"I've looked all over for GoldenEye for my old school N64 but never could find it. Then I found it on Amazon, this is a nice change from the all digital world of FPS games. The graphics are not bad, but if you plan on playing this on your HDTV I would recommend getting a converter that takes the VGA ( Yellow, White & Red ) cables an converts the VGA signal to HDMI so you can play on your High Definition TV. Played this on christmas with the relatives an they were having a blast. Didn't think they would considering it's N64 an not Xbox ONE.

Just playing the game gives you a view of how far technology has come, it might be old an not as detailed as some FPS games but still gives you a perspective of what technology used to look like back in 1996 when the N64 was released. Today this game remains a favorite among gamers. If you have kids & a N64 id take the xbox away for a day an have them play N64 so they can see where & how technology has taken Gaming. Just don't let them play 007 GoldenEye, have them play Diddy Kong Racing.",5.0

"An oldy, but a goody. Countless hours of battles between my brothers and I. Only problem was screen peeking, which we solved with a screen divider made from cardboard(Oh yeah). Definitely recommend it to anyone with a N64.",5.0
I played this when it first came out on the Nintendo 64.  Once I started I couldn't put it down until I beat every level on every difficulty.  Back than my friends and I worked 2nd shift and after work would come over and play multiplayer into the morning.  Occasionally I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in to revisit my favorite levels.  The graphics are dated now but the game play is still fun.  Researching the games development history to find things that never made it into the finished version but whose code is still included in the cartridge and can be accessed is interesting as well. If you have an old Gameshark for instance you can use it to walk to the mysterious island off in the distance of the Dam Level.  A great game all around.,5.0

"I enjoy this so much various reasons
1. The cartrage it self is new I mean no Knicks, no writing, no wear and tear it's in great condition.
2. It was shipped fast only 3 days.
3. It works just fine. I mean I have no trouble with it. Just that the save files weren't wiped off. But that is fixable
4. It's legend of Zelda: orcina of time!!!!!!!!!!! What is there not to love about this game? Seriously the best n64 game ( besides some others).
5. My 10 month old daughter loves it as well. She tries to play and gets super excited when the title screen comes on so cute.

"I believe the year was 1999 and I would play this game with 3 other friends all day, every day. It was like we were hooked. Proximity mines, rockets, power weapons we played it all. The single player is amazing as well. Just an all time classic that never gets old.",5.0
awesome game a must for old school gamers,5.0
"This classic game based on the popular 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye 007, starring Pierce Brosnan as dashing agent 007 and Sean Bean as 006, a rouge MI6 agent preparing to destroy the English Economy. This game is the grandfather of the FPS genre. The game offers alot, smooth controls, 20 action filled levels, Multi Player with tons of characters, and not to forget the awesome cheats. GoldenEye will provide a nice gaming expirence for any gamer with different levels of difficulty and challenge. Most games based on films are often poor and deviate from the original source material. This game does not.  It's Bond, James Bond on Nintendo 64.",5.0

"It was perfect. Game was in great condition, sticker on it was great. Thanks for being honest. Everything was as describe. Thanks again!",5.0
"This is one of those special games. I don't think many words can summarize how much I truly love this game. I remember when I was a child of nine, getting this game for the first time, and playing it with my brother. He gave up after we got almost half-way through. Then I played till the end. It took about a year to beat, but good lord was it a worthwhile, building experience that paid off in the end.

Everything's perfect. I view it, of course, through rose-coloured glasses, but I stand by my opinion. The fact that you start as a young boy, and then grow over seven years into a young man means that you grow with the game. The main character ends up being someone cool you look up to. The temples are great. The Water Temple may be an exception, but everything else is awesome -- in particular the Forest and Spirit Temples. Those will always be my favourite ones in each play-through (I would add in the Fire Temple and Ganon's Castle as close ties for third). The bosses, oh the bosses! I think that the best one is Phantom Ganon, or maybe perhaps Twinrova. Ganondorf, the final boss, is not far behind. The cinematic quality of that last battle is astounding -- it makes you really feel the tension in saving a world from complete destruction.

This will always be Nintendo's masterpiece for me. My childhood spent playing N64 is filled with memories of Mario, Donkey Kong 64, Goldeneye 64, and a host of other great games. But this one stands out. This one's the best. Nothing more or less could be said.",5.0

I had this game as a kid and it was great. It still is. The game was great for it's time and replaying this game now adds nostalgia into my adult life.,5.0
Game plays great and my son and I are having a great time playing it. I was so happy to be able to buy this game for the price I did versus the $50 + that most people were selling it for.,5.0
Fun gift for gamers because it's nostalgic. This is for N64 consoles and it is first person shooter. Has multi-player option but you beat levels playing solo.,5.0
"Man oh man, now this game takes me back to playing split screen multiplayer with 3 other people on the same tv. This game is just as good as i remember it, though present day fps games have much better controls. I do not hold that against this game though, as it is 2 generations old.",5.0

"Brings back memories of days long gone by.

"I've yet to be more captivated by a videogame than the original ""Goldeneye"" for Nintendo 64. Yes, the graphics are laughable now, and other aspects of the game are certainly dated, but the game is as addicting as ever, putting you squarely in control of the characters and all of the levels are very well formatted and easy to follow. Playing this game still takes me back to when I was a kid, struggling for months to beat the first level when I realized all I had to was shoot the lock on the gate. Nostalgia may influence my rating, but even without rose tinted glasses, ""Goldeneye"" holds up incredibly well as the prototype for which all first person shooters modeled themselves after, and is still the best 007 game to date.",5.0
Video game is amazing! No problems with the game unit. Thank you for the shipment. I am now reliving my childhood!,5.0
"Son had requested this as a gift, thinking we'd not be able to find it. He was really tickled when I let him know that it was available. It arrived in time to be trialed prior to his Christmas visit, and he couldn't have been happier.",5.0

"I will recommend this game because it is my favourite platformer of all  time. It has everything necessary to be a wonderful game. Some lovable  characters, tough puzzles, and a fantastic bad guy.
Banjo is not so  difficult as to be unenjoyable but it's a pretty hard slog to the finish.  The Credits appear long before the game is over and the Witch at the  conclusion seems to last forever.
I can't complain about anything in  this game. There is a training programme at the start which continues into  the game and makes sure you know how everything works. The rhyming is very  funny and every inch of the game is explorable. Nothing then to complain  about the game, unfortunately though it was marketed as a furry teddy bear  game and it's much more than this. It's tougher than Goldeneye for crying  out loud.",5.0
"well at first it seemed like a kiddie game, but i rented it anyways. well  i was amazed by how much fun the game is. lots of puzzles lots of monsters  and lots of laughs! this game besides bein a real good puzzle game its one  of the most funniest. i mean a bear and a bird? watsup with dat? don't  matter the game is good for all ages, if u like puzzle games with lots of  laughs get it.",5.0
Excellent item!,5.0
I absolutely love this game and I was so happy to receive it like 2 days after I had bought it. It was so funny seeing how bad the graphics were since it was made in 1998 but this game is my childhood and this one is actually really hard to play then the other ones and it took me a lot longer to get through the levels but it was so totally worth it in the end.,5.0

My game came in the mail very quickly (I even ordered it around Christmas).  At first the game didn't work but I sent an email to the seller and I got a response within the time it took me to eat dinner.  They gave me some great helpful tips on how to clean the game and its working great.  I wish that they would have cleaned the game themselves and made sure it was in working order before shipping it but the quick response and friendliness kept this provider with 5 stars in my book.,5.0

"Tomb Raider III, to me, Is the best one in the Series. You can choose where you want to go first, have an amazing selection of weapons.. It's just fun. The India levels are a little hard for new-comers, mainly the 2nd level. But just search for a guide online, and you'll get past it fine, It took me.. around 2 hours for that one level on my first play-through, lol! But i enjoyed every second of it. Buy this game, you WILL NOT regret it. and for all of these people saying it sucks. They are just lazies who like to beat games in 1 hour, and hate difficulty. Tomb Raider III incorporates difficulty into it's game, and makes it fun! Buy it! :)",5.0
"This is my fav Tomb Raider game (the 1st is a close 2nd), but.... It's way too hard for people just starting with the series. You really have to check out all of your options, because secrets are often irretrievable once you passed a certain point (The level River Ganges even has 2 alternative routes, one of which makes you miss out on a secret!) and in other points you really start to think the makers of this game are a sadistic bunch hellbent on annoying the hell out of you.

Some, in retrospect fairly easy, moves kept me occupied for hours. But, all in all, a game isn't a game if it isn't challenging. And this game is challenging to the max!",5.0

"For anyone who is a new age gamer and i mean this in no offense! You have got to put the new age graphics out of your head and not just play the game but you have got to be link through the controller. Not only was this game the best at the time but still to this time i have found nothing that has come close to such an epic story line, simplistic yet advanced gear set up. And lets not all forget the amazing music by the ocarina, numerous puzzles you couldn't just Google to figure out. and last but not lease the lock on battle style. My video game child hood all time fight was fighting link shadow and pulling off every skill you mastered in the water temple. All i can say is if you are currently playing a game say thanks to this game because it was the platform that turned into a road for all future games. sincerely blitz!!",5.0

Great game.  This was the first Zelda game I ever played and what an adventure it was.  If you like your game worlds big with plenty to explore you'll love this game.

"A great first person shooter! This game was released for Nintendo in 1996. It is played on a 64-bit operating system and has still worked to this day. The game is based on the 1995 movie of Goldeneye directed by Martin Campbell. The Goldeneye is a top-secret space weapon designed for sending an electromagnetic pulse that will shut down all electronic equipment. In the game, you play as agent 007 James Bond and work with a Russian Computer Programmer named Natalya to stop Alec Trevelyan from destroying London. Alec Trevelyan who is 006 has betrayed his organization and has become the ultimate bad guy of James Bond. I give this game five stars for it's great game play, plot, and multiplayer settings. Highly recommended for anyone who likes espionage.",5.0

"I share a great relationship with this game. Before it came out, I received a promotional VHS Tape in the mail that told me about the game, its stages, and gameplay. It was a better instruction manual than the booklet! I also love how the footage was taken from the beta version of the game. With its promotional montage, you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conker's game another cartoony adventure rather than the adult-oriented one they ended up making.
 - Anyway the game is fantastic, a perfect supplement to Super Mario 64. In some ways it's actually better. When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats, to just have fun and explore. I played it enough times to 100% the game in two hours. And then when GameFAQs started to be a thing, I used the lesser-known cheats to get the ice key and the secret eggs. For those who like those old days of collecting stuff, this is the game to get.",5.0

"Oca rina of time brings back fond memories. my brother & I both beat the game. The graphics still hold up well
today and puts present games to shame. It may be the greatest videogame ever created, who knows? You can
freely explore the landscape, the difficulty level is just right. There's no need for a strategy guide, if you're clever &
smart. Zelda even puts the Super Mario games to shame in my opinion. I don't have my N64 any more so I'd download
it on my WII VC, better than paying those ridiculous prices on Amazon, only fools & sheep would pay that much for
an old video game. It only costs you $11.00 for the WII VC version, so do the math, fools! I've been a Zelda fan since
the 1st Zelda on the NES, Shigeru Miyamoto is the greatest video game designer of all time, he should be in the
Video Game Hall of Fame. Zelda influenced the action/rpg genre, even to this day. Even Sony made a Zelda clone
game called ""Dark Cloud"", remember that game? But anyway, if you haven't played OOT, do yourself a favor and
buy an actual copy or download from WII VC.",5.0

"This game is the epitomy of greatness as far as Adventure/Action games are concerned. Today is 2004, and I installed this game on my PC after finding it buried in the back of my drawer. I expected crap. Man was I off....
Basically, you are Lara Croft, and run around from the Jungles of India to Area 51 in Nevada, to the abandoned railway tunnels of London's Alwych, to the stone age wilderness of the South Pacific(infested with Raptors, of course ;D), and finally to Antarctica to this really cool lost city.
On the whole, this game breaks down like this:
  - Graphics: 7/10 - For it's time, not bad.....
  - Sound: 9/10 - Excellent. Music is good, voiceovers believable, etc.....
  - Gameplay - 9/10 - Not much different from other TR games yet strangely, it's a lot of fun",5.0

"Goldeneye 64. Yet another amazing game from Rare for the N64. Whether you're a Bond fanatic or not, you'll definitely like this game.

The game's plot pretty much follows the movie exactly, but with some changes here and there. I won't go into detail about it, though. You'd like to know about different things of the game, right? Right. Well, let's start off with the music. Oh my God, the music. It's amazing. Very well done and very memorable. Especially the first level's music. No matter how much I listen to it, I never get bored. In fact, I seem to love it more and more, no matter how many times it loops (which is every several minutes or so). In short, the music is great.

Secondly, let's go to the graphics. Now, the graphics for its time, which is 1997 (two years after the movie, in case you didn't know), are really good. Nothing mindblowingly special, but they're really good. When you shoot an enemy, you can see blood where you shot him/her, which is pretty cool, too. 007's character model is well done, it doesn't necessarily feel ''thrown together'' and cheap. His model looks like it was worked on, but like I said before, it's 1997, so don't expect anything mindblowing. Overall, good character models and good graphics for the various areas you're put in.

Next up, the weapons. The weapons are really awesome. You first start off with Bond's traditional PPK (silenced)pistol. Of course, you get many other guns that are also very cool, too. With a cheat, you can get every weapon in the game and judging from what I had seen using this cheat..the variety is amazing. I won't spoil anything for you, but there's a LOT of cool weapons. No disappointment here either.

The difficulty. Like most games, there are difficulty settings. What's cool about Goldeneye's difficulty setting is that it also alters how many mission objectives you are given. Very, very nice feature. If you get a little bored with one difficulty setting and what a harder setting with more things to do, you get two more steps up. Very, very cool. Now, straying away from the actual setting choice just a bit, there is one level that is extremely dark and hard to see, and in this level you have to find a certain area and then make it back to the start and do something else. This is on the easiest setting. Sound easy? Well, you better guess again. This level is darker than night and no matter how many enemies you kill, they're harder to get rid of than cockroaches..except you can actually get rid of cockroaches, or have a chance to. These things really ruin the whole level for me. It's like you're set in Hell. I had to use a couple of cheats just to pass the level and even when you first start the level, you get ambushed by several enemies within seconds, so you better have some quick cheat-activating fingers if you want to make it through. Unless you're a god at this level, you'll probably need a bit of help. But from what I have experienced in the game, this is probably the only huge con to it. There's also another level where you have to find Natalya (a main character in the game), which can be very confusing, but it is definitely better than the previous level described.

The gameplay and controls are also great. It may take you a few minutes to get the hang of it, but you'll learn them quickly. The controls are very responsive and great. Gameplay is great. Absolutely NO letdown here.

Goldeneye is also highly praised for many of its traits. Zoomable sniper rifles, stealth traits and mission objectives that change depending on the difficulty setting like I have already mentioned before. It deserves its praise, too, because of how much of an influential, important game it is. Before this, there wasn't much like it. There was Doom 64, but it didn't have the same traits as Goldeneye. Goldeneye 64 definitely deserves its praise for being one of the greatest games on the N64 (and basically in general). It deserves a special place in your N64 collection, unless you're not a big FPS fan, then that's okay, too. It's your preference. The game also has a multiplayer mode, which I have not played it, but you should play it if you've got a friend who has nothing else to do and is open to the offer.

Overall, the game is amazing, and that's an understatement. Rare outdid themselves once again, and this game proves it. It's just a game that you must play if you have a Nintendo 64 around, or one that's on its way to your house right now. Just amazing. That's all I have to say and all I really can say. It's just an amazing game.

Pros:
-Good graphics, character models and the settings of levels.
-Choice of difficulty setting and the varying mission objectives depending on the setting is a really amazing feature.
-Variety of amazing weapons to obtain.
-Extremely fun gameplay and levels.
-Controls are great and very responsive.
-Game autosaves, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to save anything.

Cons:
-The dark level I had described is hell to play through. There may be one or two levels overall that will annoy you, but not many.

"Goldeneye needs no introduction. It is, in opinion, what led the movement of high-quality shooter games. Over 15 years after this game was released, I grew tired of my modern video games (Halo, Call of Duty) and had to buy it. A great game to bring out after a few 6-packs with your buddies.

No game ever surpassed the attention to detail and sheer feel of adventure as Ocarina of Time. I hope the new Zelda for Wii U changes that! Zelda is the one pure reason i became a gamer.,5.0
The game was delivered earlier than expect and works great! Very very pleased!,5.0
I was worried about getting this but I did anyways because I have been after it for a long time. I was worried because it was Used-Acceptable but it has played great so far (though I haven't gotten very far yet) So so far I am so glad I went ahead and ordered it.,5.0

"One of the games that made n64 so great, had graphics for the time, multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of it's time",5.0
with this game you play through each level in the movie.  this is when James Bond was James Bond.  you can choose from a whole list of players to choose from to play as.  you can get any kind of weapon just about through the whole game.  and you can even play with some friends on missions.  if you have never played a n64 what are you waiting for.  5 out of 5.  super fun.,5.0
the best game I have ever owned I have had it for at least 16 years now and I still play religiously this game and perfect dark,5.0
"I got this for Christmas when it first came out, I couldn't tell you how many hours I spent playing it. I played it until my N64 messed up. This was my first game and the N64 was my first personal console, and this game is my favorite of all time. I don't always play video games but when I do, I prefer Goldeneye.",5.0
I had no problems what so ever with this game. It worked every time I wanted to play it and there were no glitches what so ever!,5.0

"One of the best video games ever.

Redefined everything after it.

My copy came in very good condition without scratches or writing",5.0
"Love this game. Although the graphics aren't the best since it's N64 and earlier on.... I enjoy everything about it (still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the 'invisible walls' and oddly prism shaped bottles etc). The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games, all of the items are used. There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub. It all comes down to this game.... definitely worth your time to play.",5.0
"It came in good condition and worked, when I played it. There was no problems. I absolutely recommend it to everybody.",5.0
"This game is great. It's the best racing game I've ever played. It features 16 race tracks: LUIGI RACEWAY, MOO MOO FARM, KOOPA BEACH, KALIMARI  DESERT, TOAD'S TURNPIKE, FRAPPE SNOWLAND, CHOCO MOUNTAIN, MARIO RACEWAY,  WARIO'S STADIUM, SHERBET LAND, ROYAL RACEWAY, BOWSER'S CASTLE, DK'S JUNGLE  PARKWAY, YOSHI 'S VALLEY, BANSHEE BOARDWALK, and RAINBOW ROAD. And all the  tracks are divided into cups: MUSHROOM, FLOWER, STAR, and SPECIAL CUP. Each  course features twists, turns, shortcuts, and beautifully crafted graphics,  and each level has power crystals that give you an array of weapons from  banans to shells. And there are 8 characters to choose from: PEACH, TOAD,  YOSHI, MARIO, LUIGI, WARIO, BOWSER, and DONKEY KONG.
  The game  consists of racing through dazzling locations with great music and sound  effects, and fighting your way through twists and turns and weapons to get  first place. It never gets boring. This game has high replay standards.  It's the best game. It even features a battle mode than can be played with  up to four players! The battle mode contains four special levels where you  must destroy your enemy three times to win. THIS GAME IS THE BEST! OUT OF  FIVE STARS, THIS GETS 20. GREAT GAME!",5.0
"Tested and runs well. Crashed at first and sent me back to the title screen, however, a good ol' Blow in the cartridge made things better.

Thank you for the prompt delivery. However, i would recommend not using FedEx as i had to wait an extra day to receive my package due to not being home when delivered the first time around.",5.0

This game wasted have of my childhood.  it is by far the funnest fps for the 64 out there.  if you are a 64 fan this game has to be in your collection.,5.0
"I LOVE THIS GAME. It is so funny and a bit hard to beat. The hardest level is in the temple where a shuttle is launching and you have to collect data, kill Jaws, get launch tape and launch the shuttle. My favorite level is the Facility Level. That level is so funny and you can shoot the scientists, but it will fail the mission if they were killed. My cousin and I love to blow up the enemies and scientists. My favorite is shooting the scientists and enemies in their butts and they would jump up and down rubbing their butts and then they will fight back and the scientists will threw grenades at you. The controls are easy and this game is better and funnier than the movie. BUY THIS GAME.",5.0
This game is so legit!! Brings back many memories from when I was a kid. Thank you so much!! Back to many long nights of multi-player matches.,5.0
"Goldeneye 007 was simply one of the best shooting games ever, regardless of Battlefield and Call of Duty. Of course, I have to put Zelda: Ocarina of Time at #1 still. That game was just amazing. Perfect 10. I can't put it into any other words.",5.0
"The multiplayer is amazing but most reviews already cover that. I still have yet to beat the last level ""Cradle"" and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years, and yet I am addicted to trying over and over. I finished the Campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties. Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo. There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is. No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day. The remakes have been complete crap, despite the amazing COD engine. If you own a N64 and love perfect dark or other great FPS adventures you will love this.",5.0
I love this game it was on time and in great condition. Me and my boys play all the time and there is some fierce competition thank you.,5.0

"I've had this game since its orginial release I played the hell out of this game after it was released my friend and I from high school would spend countless hours playing multi-player and the single campaign missions and even had the N64 gameshark which we could use the cool codes with.  I love the muti-player with be able to select all the bad villians, the ray of weapons, the leavels and the detail.  The best James Bond video game created still is loved to this day and this game will live me to the day I die no matter what lol.  Best system released N64 game system alwesome array of games to play from.  Unfortunetly my original N64 went up on me about two years ago after using it soo much over the years and it just died.  I will never get rid of my N64 game system, though the Game cube was a major disappointment to me and the selection of games.",5.0
One of the best games ever made for N64. Definitely brings back a lot of found memories from my childhood.,5.0
I remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his. I liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset. But no worries I was 7 at the time when that happened now that I'm older i was able to buy my own copy.,5.0
"I'm overly happy with this! I use Amazon fairly often and I never write a review.  I received exactly what was shown and ahead of it's delivery date. If you're considering this, get it! This will save you so much money. Great game,  great buy, great service. Thanks Bryce!

"I used to play Goldeneye 007 for the N64 back when I was much younger. It was relentlessly fun and realistic for it's time, and it definitely never got old. One of the many things I loved about this game was the incredible music on each level. Each one had a different theme to it that just added an entirely new aspect to it's greatness. The characters and the levels were superb, and I love the fact that they decided to incorporate Jaws into the game.

I can't describe this game in words, as it is entirely to valuable.",5.0
The game arrived yesterday in awesome condition (even with the instruction booklet). Besides being the best FPS of all time in my opinion. The game works perfectly. I don't have memory packs but the cartridge had a nice game data on it with cheats. Very fast shipping too got here like 4 days early then was advertised.,5.0

This was a used game and worked just fine. I can't believe these graphics and controls used to be top of the line. Really takes you back.,5.0
"After digging through some old boxes i came across my N64, 2 controllers, a rumble pack and just about every game known to man EXCEPT this one! I was a little more than hasty in trying to find the cheapest way possible to find this game. Well i don't really like buying USED products over the internet but i will admit i was a little desperate. All in all the game works like a charm and i even bought it used through a place fulfilled by amazon and it still came in great condition and got it for 15 bucks, but man the memories this game brings back are worth Ten-Fold what i spent hahah but yes i recommend this game to anyone really fun and some what difficult on the higher modes (00 Agent) which allows for hours of gameplay but then again maybve i just suck at the game.
Thanks again amazon for not letting me down i will defintely be buying more in the future.

"I've been trying to get Goldeneye 007 for almost 10 years and I'm finally going to play it.

Pros:
Gameplay is probably the best part, it's too hard to explain, you'd have to play it to experience the awesomeness.
Music is so nostalgic
The graphics are amazing, even compared to the games of today.
The storyline is fun
Maps are creative and original
Enemies are sometimes humorous.

Cons:
NONE.

This game is just simply amazing and I just can't wait to get my hands on it again.
Buy it, you won't regret it. I promise.

"Do not play the mediocre remake of this for wii. That game is not as fun or as violent as this. Goldeneye along with Perfect Dark both have the deepest and most addicting non linear campaigns compared to any fps to date. The replay value for the single player in goldeneye is immense. There is so much to do in these huge levels and the gunplay even in 2011 is VERY satisfying. Enemies grunt so ghoulishly as you paint them red with bullet spray. You can steal a tank in two levels and exit it whenever you want to return killing on foot, unlike the linear wii remake. The multiplayer is also excellent. The best first person shooter ever crafted. If only more games where made like this. Games today focus too much on story and hollywoodized production values and not enough on FUN GAMEPLAY.",5.0
"In the age of Call of Duty and Halo one must not forget Goldeneye 007. One of the most revloutionary FPS titles of all time Goldeneye pretty much paved the way for future FPS titles to come as well as making many FPS games popular on Home Consoles. Goldeneye 007 is also one of the first Movie Games to get it right. Not only is it the most Revolutionary FPS games ever but this is also one of the best Movie Games ever. Goldeneye shooting mechanics are simple but fun. The Goals are also complicated but they work when needed to. The graphics look a bit muddy but this game was relased in 1997 so it's understandable. But the thing that made Goldeneye 007 so popular was it's multiplayer. The options were endless as 3 of your closets friends or family memebers got around the N64 for some awesome shooting action. Next to Mario Party,Mario Kart 64,Diddy Kong Racing,Perfect Dark and Super Smash Bros. Goldeneye 007 is one of the best multiplayer experinces you can find on the console. With many weapons,options and schemes the multiplayer will keep you coming back for more and more. A true Marvel. Overall if you haven't play Goldeneye 007 go play it now. Great game well worth the Money.",5.0
"I had lost this game a long time ago in a move and was very happy to pop it into my N64 and relive the excitement of Golden

What can I say about this game? I bought it to replace one that was stolen when I was a kid. It's great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music. EPIC.,5.0
"this game is REALLY good, i couldn't stop playing it. It is definitely my favorite video game of all time!!!
For starters, the controls are really good even for the N64's notoriously awful controller (although that can be fixed with a redesigned third party controller)
Secondly, the collect-o-thon or finding all of the heart pieces and hunting down all of the golden skulltulas is very fun, albeit a VERY difficult task at times. You WILL be saying at times, ""why did they put it there????""
And lastly this game puts you in a very adventurous mood and that is one reason i absolutely love zelda games.

Even though this game is one of the best of all time, it does very few downsides.
Firstly, i absolutely hate the horse-riding mechanic in this game, but it is a quick method of travel.
Secondly,when your controller un-calibrates itself this game is freaking near impossible (especially when you are aiming your bow/slingshot/hookshot) although this is more the controllers fault i have played games that aren't bad with the broken controller.

I only recommend this game to people who have immense patience. Yet for the people who do, then i highly recommend this gamely to people of all ages.",5.0
"Truth be told, I hated this game at first. I got this for my birthday this past year, because it looked great. After all, it is regarded as the best game ever made. When I started playing, though, I thought the game was really flawed. I thought it was too difficult, cryptic, and the music was lackluster. Compared to A Link to the Past the game was horrible. I would pick up the game after a few months, then put it down, then pick it up again. I wondered how people could beat this game, and if I could. After this, I stopped playing. Not for long, though.

  It was the day before Thanksgiving. I was really bored, and my thoughts kept pestering me about Ocarina of Time, how I only just got the Master Sword, how I'm not a gamer because I didn't beat it, and so on. I finally decided to try it one more time. I left off where you get the hookshot. Then, I went to the Forest Temple, and was instantly hooked. I loved the design, the difficulty, the puzzles-everything about the Forest Temple. Once I beat the Forest Temple, I just HAD to play some more. I went to get Epona, Link's horse, then to get some heart pieces, then the Fire Temple, etc. This game was so good, I just had to beat it. You could say I was addicted to it.

  After I beat the Water Temple, though, Thanksgiving weekend was over, so I had to go to school. *Sigh*. That was one of the longest weeks of my life, having to wait until the weekend to beat the next temple. Over the next two weeks, I beat the Shadow and Spirit Temple. Then, I knew it was time-time to go beat Ganondorf. Immediately after the Spirit Temple, I went to the Temple of Time, got the Light Arrows, and went to Ganon's tower. Then I saved, did some other things, and that night, I was going to beat the game. I had to. I got up to the top of the tower to fight Ganondorf. I finished that battle, but when I thought it was all over, Ganon  was at the bottom. The Master Sword flew out of Link's hand, and I knew I was in for an epic battle. In the end, I beat him, and was greeted by a great ending.

  The gameplay in Ocarina of Time is wonderful. Link can do quite a few moves with his sword, and they're all really useful in certain situations. It is also fun to use these moves even when you aren't fighting a big boss, or even fighting at all. The dungeons are cleverly designed. Sometimes they will make you scratch your head and think. At other times there are puzzles that are easy and fun. Link's arsenal of tools is pretty awesome, too. He has the hookshot, which gets him to high places and stuns enemies. Link also has a spell called Din's Fire, which makes a lot of fire. Last, but not least, is the storyline. I'm not going to go into description, but it is pretty good, and sets the mood for the game. About the bad parts of the game, well, I didn't like child Link. His shield would burn, and his sword was tiny and weak. Besides that, though, the gameplay in Ocarina of Time is great.

  Now let's talk about graphics and sound. I realize that in 2013, this game doesn't look graphically impressive at all. Actually, for modern standards, this game looks chunky and bad. However, in 1998, this game had amazing graphics. People were amazed by the vastness of Hyrule field, by how pretty Lake Hylia was, and by how intimidating and scary the final battle with Ganon was. I think this game really pushed the N64 to its limits. About the music, that was wonderful. After playing the whole game, I really love most of the songs. My favorites are the Song of Storms, Shiek's theme, the Forest Temple theme, Gerudo Valley, the Song of Time, and Ganon's theme. There were just so many great songs in this game.

  Although Ocarina of Time isn't my favorite game ever, it is up there. It is definitely not overrated either, it is that good. If you hate this game, play it again. I guarantee you will love it. Or maybe, these toys are too much for you.",5.0

Most games would focus more on single player experiences (Which I am fine with but, sometimes i like to gloat in the person who is sitting right next to me's face)If anyone says otherwise, lock them in your basement (or a very dark roon with a tv and a n64) and make them play ""Golden Gun"" mode with you for 48 hours straight.

"In the year 1997, Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo 64 by Rare, an unknown company and new 2nd party developer. Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.

REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.

REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.

If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends. Peace. :)",5.0
"GoldenEye 007 was simply the greatest game ever made. No if, ands or buts. This game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game world. My Uncle Steve was the first person to tell me about the game in 1997 and told me I had to get Goldeneye and told me Its the best game he ever played and he only had a Playstaion at the time. I played this game when it first game out I was 11 years old and I'm now 24 and still love it to the death. GoldenEye set the standards for every FPS that has followed.",5.0

"i played this game when i was about 15, and i'm now 24 and still love it to the death (literally). I have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real. I also have always loved how you can choose many different people in 2 player mode, such as 007 to scientist. The golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill, but if you like a really smashing good time, you can always punch or cut your way out. A must have game for the 64 :-)",5.0

"Goldeneye set the standards for every FPS that has followed. It is the best of the best. The levels are action packed and extremely memorable. I can do the levels in my head I've played them so many times. The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best.

Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5

Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5

Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/

Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5

Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5

Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more. This game will never be forgotten or equaled. 5/5

"What can be said about Ocarina of Time? I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a ""dark time is approaching."" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought ""ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!"" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!

A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the ""Best Game of All Time"" by some, and the ""Most Overrated Game of All Time"" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.

Story:

You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a ""Princess of Destiny,"" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.

Gameplay:

To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it.

Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that ""You can go wherever you want."" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.

Controls:

They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.

Ocarina of Time introduced a ""Z-targeting system"" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.

Music:

*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.

Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P

Oh, and I'm sad to report that the ""OoT Commercial Music"" is not in this game... :(

Replay Value:

It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations.

Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the ""Three Heart Challenge,"" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard).

But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.

"Seriously. As awesome as the games before and after this game are, there is truly NO touching OOT. The story is amazing and well thought out, the game play is simple, the music is suburb, and all console Zelda games stem from this right here. SUCH as excellent game.

"GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.

This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.

The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).

This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.

(Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)",5.0
I bought this game for my boyfriend and he loves it. The game works great- no problems at all.,5.0
"You people who say this game is to easy and fun are probably those sissy people who do nothing in their lives except play video games and smoke pot all day.  Then you get on here and whine about every little thing and wonder why the world isn't the way you want it.  And you, the guy with the 13 your old kid, get a life kids used to play cowboys and Indians all the time 30+ years ago.  So quit pushing your PC crap on other people.
By the way this was a great game and still is.",5.0
"Great Game, Have a lot of fun playing this game - has a lot of action. This is a must have game!",5.0
"Here it is, the ultamite Bond Game.  Based on the movie of the same name, few thaught that it would turn out to be a revolutionary Masterpeice.  I admit that I think that FPS games are not my favorite genre and that I feel like many FPS games realesed this generation are pretty Generic and repetitive, there is something about this game that I think is just a perfect marage that realy feels like an incredibly well crafted N64 game from RARE.  Everything from the weapons, the objectives, the difficulty, the Multiplayer( so much to tell about this), the Graphics, The Music, everything about it just feels so well done that it is nearly flawless.

Presentation:  The Story is mostly the same as the movie Goldeneye( which I thaught was easily the best Peirce Brosnan one by the way), so it involves stoping a sattelite used to target London under the orders of the Mysterious Janus.  Bond must infiltrate facilitys, bunkers, go through cold severnaya, Through the streets of saint Petersberg, and many other places as he tracks down Janus to his base in Cuba.

graphics:  Even though it was an early N64 game, it still features some of the best 3D graphics of its time,  Although many charecters look square close up, they still look very detaild for their time.  many of the charecters look almost identical to the acters, alec tryvillian looks like sean bean, Bond looks like Peirce Brosnan, and well you get the idea.  Their are also many effects to the graphics such as fog, smpoke,, reflections in the glass, and much more.  the death animations are also different and detaild, as are the different weapons.  i perssonnaly realy like the Snow levil because of the detail and the hoods that the bad gyes wear which makes it hard to see that they are square.  I also realy like the silo, and the antenna cradle look salmost identical to the movie.

Sound:  another aspect that this game does extremely well is it sound.  The gunfire, the screams, the explosions, are all Spectacular.  It is very satisfying to hear the sound of your weapons shooting the enemy.  the music is simply outstanding.  The Classic Bond theme plays throughout the game, it has many clever remixes as well.  The music fits the atmesphere of each levil.  The only thing it is missing is the Goldeneye theme but that is hardly important with every other aspect that was transferred to the game perfectly.

Gameplay:  This game has 18 missions that you play through to complete it.  The missions certainly get harder as the game goes on.  Once you Complete the game once, you will unlock harder difficulty settings.  There is alot of variety in the activitys that you do.  You must infiltrate a Russion base to meet up with 006, Sneek into the severnya bunker to Steal the Goldeneye Key, save Hosteges on a frigate and put a tracking bug on a helicopter, go through a mazelike statue park, chase generl Orumov through the streets of saint. Petersberg, stop a train, go through Cuba, and eventually come to the base to stop the Goldeneye sattelite.  The Controls work Very well and feel like they wer tailor made for the N64.  You can even change the controller Funcionallity to what suit you best.  There are many Great Weapons in the game.  You ussually initially start out with the water PPK(Called the PP7 in the game, i do not know why), but later aquire enemys weapons such as the soviete, Sniper Rifle, Grenade Launcher, Klobb, And many others.  each weapon has its uses depending on the Levil you are playing on.  As you Play, you Really feel like 007, and almost Every Levil is extremely fun to play and replay.  You can also unlock many cheats for completing certain objectives.  This game is probably Know widely for its Amzing Multiplayer.  And the Multiplayer is amazing.  It is just a blast to get four people together and just shoot the hell out of each other.  There are many different modes such as You only live twice, flag tag, the living daylights, the man with the golden gun, and of course normal, as well as many more.  I just love getting the Golden gun and blasting everyone in one hit.  This game realy has everything you could want from an FPS game, or a Bond Game.

Bad:  In a few of the missiona, you will have the Bond Girl, Natalia with you.  i find her pretty annoying, she seems to run in front of me while I am shooting bad gyes, You have to protect her, she has lame puns toward the end, And in one of the later stages you have to protect her while she hacks into the Computer, which is realy a pain I think.  She has a pistol, why the hell dosent she use it more to defend herself while i shhot bad gyes.  I also did not see the point tin changing the names of the guns eather.

Good:  Well just about everything else that I posted.  The controls are Flawles, the Graphics were great for their time, the music and sound efects are fantastic, the missions are Very Well crafted and extremely fun to play, The Multiplayer has everything you could want, their are jsut so many good aspects.  This was and still is, a Masterpeice, and in my opinion remains, not only the best James Bond game, but one of the Best N64 Games Eever created.",5.0

"Always loved the classics and this was a great buy. You can't beat the legend of Zelda games, they give you tons of fun puzzles and adventure.",5.0
"When I first got my Gamecube, this game was part of the Zelda collector's edition. I didn't know much about Zelda, and had only played very few games before, but was mesmerized by this game. The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative; it really draws you in to the story. I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.

What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil.

Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure. Playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experience.",5.0

"I have fond memories of this game, and still get together to play it with friends.
Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with ""slappers only.""

In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill.

The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different.

The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives).

Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it. This
is Rare's N64 Masterwork ( Perfect Dark is pretty sweet, too).",5.0
"I am a major player of 007 games. I have played nearly every single one, but I have to say, GoldenEye is one of the best that there is, even years and platforms later. Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other 007 games, I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye.

GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion, even better than the movie) and long missions, which allow a lot of replay value. The graphics are a bit blurry, but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.

Overall, I love this game, and would reccomend it to any 007 fan.",5.0

It has been too darn long since I last played this master piece.

Great selection of weapons, nice variety of levels, Huge list of characters to choose from (from the original bond movies), fun options while playing (Bobble head characters, paint ball shooting marks).

I am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends. Large gatherings, challenges, playing till the break of dawn. I will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets =) .

"Goldeneye 007 on the now obsolete Ninetndo 64 is still to this day my favourite game of all time. Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter. The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun. Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life, but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare's wonderful game.

"this game revolutionized fps and gaming in general. a lot of people say the graphics arnt good, but hmm... this game was made 1, no, 2, wait 9 years ago!  when i have friends over we can sit and play this game for hours at a time.  multiplayer has so many different options, i suggest proximity mines only, and such big levels.  one player is just as good.  it provides a good challenge without being so impossible.  the controls are perfect, a newborn could learn them they are so easy to figure out.  over all the game is just so awsome. words cant express my feelings about it.  this game has cause me to lose so many hours of sleep because it rocks so much.

graphics: 4.9/5  come on, it was made in '97 what do you expect

sound: 5/5 pretty realistic gun sounds

multiplayer: 10/5 so awsome!!!!!!!!!!!

"I first played this game when I was 9 years old. I was completely blown away by everything about it. The dungeons are beautifully designed, the enemies are diverse, the music is excellent, and the storyline, while fairly simplistic, is great. I am now 24, and I can still say that this is, without a doubt, my favorite game. I've seen several negative reviews on here; most of them mention the controls or the puzzles being too hard. All I can say is, I played and beat this game when I was 9 (it was also the first game I ever played for Nintendo 64, and I have never been a hardcore gamer, then or now) in a couple of months, playing an hour or less per day, usually 3 or 4 days a week.  I will admit that I got stuck several times, but I always figured out what to do eventually, and without the help of a strategy guide or going online. As for the controls, I personally believe they are extremely easy to learn, especially as you are taught extensively how to use them in the early stages of the game. Another complaint I've heard is that this game is childish and does not appeal to adults. I do believe that the game was targeted more towards teenagers and pre-teens, but I know plenty of adults who still enjoy this game, myself included. I definitely believe that it is NOT geared towards young children. First of all, I think the story and dialogue would go over their heads, and though it is rated E, there is some blue or green blood that spurts out when you hit enemies with your sword (the final boss, Ganondorf, pukes up blood after you defeat him). If you are a fan of classic games, enjoy fantasy/action-adventure, and own a Nintendo 64, I cannot recommend this game enough. I was dumb enough to let an acquaintance borrow my version several years ago, and found out a couple weeks ago that he ""lost"" it when I asked for it back. I wouldn't be surprised if he just wanted to keep it for himself, and I honestly can't blame him. It's that good. I just ordered another copy a few days ago, and cannot wait until it comes. BUY THIS GAME!!! You won't be sorry, unless of course, you're the type who only enjoys adult-themed, blood-and-gore-everywhere-type games.",5.0

"I loved this game as a kid but my older brother took it with him when he moved out.  It works perfectly and arrived in due time.  I was worried ordering a used game because some I'd ordered from places in the past haven't worked, but have absolutely no complaints!

For any who want a review of the game itself:
Of all the games we played growing up this one stood out due to its creativity and its soundtrack.  I love the variation in the worlds, from wandering the beaches of Treasure Trove Cove to the snowy winter wonderland of Freezeezy Peak.  The characters are fun, and the ""violence"" is very child-friendly.  My mom enjoyed listening to us play it enough she went out and bought the soundtrack so she could listen on her own!
Hats off to the makers of this game, because the level of creativity and imagination that went into it was outstanding.",5.0

"I first tried Command and Conquer Tiberian Wars at my brothers house.  I tried to load that game, but my computer hardware was not adequate.  So I ordered Tiberian Sun which is compatible with my hardware.  Since I haven't played the Command and Conquer series much before, I don't have much to compare it to. But this game is loads of fun even if it is very frustrating. Even in Easy mode some of the levels are really difficult until you figure out the right strategy. I was forever on the destroy radar array level until I finally discovered there was a back way in.  Anyway, the game is lots of fun and takes a lot of thinking to play.",5.0
"I don't care if you are a novice gamer, a weak gamer, gamer with poor taste, half blind gamer, have no discretion or discernment this game is totally rock'n awesome!  Some don't know a good game when they see it but there's no mistaking one like this.  I have played every single C&C game made so far and none disappoint, and that's a fact!  Even for those who, like I said before, don't know a good one when they come across it.  Tiberian Sun is so detailed and graphically amazing anyone who says they don't like it either never tried it or have an alterior motive, call me on this, I'll prove it.  Yes, I do defend all the games that are far ahead of their time yet don't get due respect, especially if a goof gamer tries to run them down.  I've noticed that a lot of people run down certain games b/c they aren't good enough to play them or smart enough and that's fine, everybody has their own style and strengths but don't trash a game just b/c you're no good.  Don't listen to those in opposition to TS, it is worth whatever it takes to get and play.  This is a strategy game that got me addicted to strategy games.  The only problem I have with this one is that WS didn't create a sequel.",5.0
"When it comes to single-player (solo) gaming, Tiberian Sun is the best of
the C&C/Red Alert series!  Why?  Let me count the reasons.
Tiberian Sun missions are the most varied and interesting.  It isn't all
about building up a base and destroying the enemy's base.  When you play as
a GDI or NOD, you think one side really is superior (I thought GDI was
until I realized NOD had better defensive base capabilities).  The units &
vehicles were really ahead of its time when you compare the game to RA or
RA2.  And lastly, TS really was harder for me compared to the other series.
When it comes to multi-player (online) gaming, I imagine that TS is the
best to play with too, although I imagine that NOD gets played an
overwhelming amount due to its superior defensive base technologies and
offensive weapons (stealth, artillery, destructive chemical weapons,
lasers, burrowing, etc).  The only good thing I can think about GDI is if
someone gets to build too many bombers, then GDI will attrition NOD to
death.",5.0

"Banjo-Kazooie is one of my favorite games, and it works perfectly after all these years and being shipped around the country. perfect.",5.0
Its a great game and is fun for all ages! I've enjoyed it so much and can't wait to share!,5.0
"Although its collect-a-thon gameplay shows a little age by today's standards in gaming, Banjo-Kazooie stands as a landmark in Rare's history, especially as one from an era when Rare tended to follow in Nintendo's footsteps. But Banjo-Kazooie shows they were capable of more than just crafting a platformer in Mario's image; they were able to add to and tweak the gaming blueprints enough to make for an original adventure without ruining anything.

Progression in the game relies mainly on the collection of music notes and puzzle pieces (much like the collecting of stars in Super Mario 64), and this often times involves an array of abilities and items that must be aquired (also reminiscent of Mario 64). But although the core gameplay between the two is undeniably similar, the whole feels different enough to still feel entertaining and original. Where as Mario 64 has you hunting down caps that grant you certain powers, Banjo seeks transformations (which is one of the game's most entertaining aspects) that sometimes change how you play completely. The main hub area (Grunty's Lair) also blends smoothly into its own ten individual worlds, giving you a sense that the worlds really are connected.

Its a fun, lighthearted game that has you wanting to visit each world the same way a kid eagerly yearns to ride every ride at the amusement park!

Now, I know for a fact that people are going to disagree with a lot that i have said, but you know what? SCREW YOU POSERS",5.0
"Super Mario 64 may have been the revolution but this is the point where everything you thought about video gaming has changed.  First person shooters are normaly redundant where you just ran around shooting bad guys with little regard to story line or even structure.

This game actually has a story line and each mission has solid objectives you must complete before you finish the level otherwise you must redo it.  The characters are as solid as they were in the movie and you interact with them in a very life like way.  You have a wide range of weapons you can use(all real life weapons just with the names changed).  The multiplayer mode is timeless where you can fight up to three other players in complex arenas using any weapon you can choose.

The game is not without flaws of course. For example, if you drop a tracking device you were suppose to put on something you fail the mission.  Why can't you just pick it up and place it correctly?  The animation is very realistic but the facial expressions on the characters are static.  For example, if a guy is happy he will remain happy even when he's dying with five bullets in his head.  Some of the objectives are pointless such as destroying the gun drones and the weapon cache in the Jungle level.  The game doesn't follow the movie completely.  For example,  The plane on the runway is just sitting there instead of you having to chase after it on a motorcycle.

The landscapes are beautiful.  Just check out the snow levels and the jungle level.  This is a fantastic game that any wideo gamer should own.  When you have finished with this one be sure to check out the semi-sequel Perfect Dark.

P.S.

This game can be extremely frustrating at times.

Just try doing the Aztec level on 00agent mode and

you'll see what I mean",5.0
At first it was a little hard to understand but once i got use to it i had so much fun just going arround and blowing aneything up that i could.

"Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end. There was no other game like it. Empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it. This was a mental good multiplayer in 1997. We all played this side by side for years. I can't say I have played anything quite like it since. Golden Eye N64. Yeah, those where the days!!! I remember this left Playstation 1 owners in awe.",5.0
"This is the best shoot em up on the N64. I was very impressed with the game play, the graphics, the action, the multi player fun, everything.... the only downfall about the game is I wanted more, more, more. The cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you don't need a memory card, everything saves on the cartridge. RARE actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the N64 into this game somehow, and it suprises me that it does not even use the N64 Expansion pack to do that!!! This game is not just hoursand hours of fun, but days, weeks, years . i still play this cool game even today!",5.0
"This vidoeo game is the best ever.  Now all games are complicated, and it can take a week to just learn.

Four years after it came out it is still my favorite game .  All of my friends and myself at college still play multiplayer almost everyday.",5.0

Westwood Online has created online gaming, (which is all I play.)

"This is the best strategy game of the year. I agree with all of the critcs saying so. The Command and Conquer series is a great strategy forming game. The graphics would be an 8/10. The gameplay would be a 9/10. The characters are awesome. You will feel the power of GDI's Mammoth Mark II, while NOD's chemical and multi missles will leave you stunned. 38 great mission of pure fun! And after you beat the game play Skirmishes or Made Up Games by picking a terrain or making your own. This is an absolutely amazing game. Pick it up at a store, and while your at it pick up Firestorm Expansion Pack. They cost together like 15 bucks. Cheap for an awesome game.",5.0
"Being the third major installment of the all time great C&C seris tiberian sun was released in 1999 with enormous anticipation and fanfare. Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam.
The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some ""new"" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it.
Some other pros-
Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer.
Almost always runs smoothly.
Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play.
Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack.
Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later.
A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game.
A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet.
The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank.
There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play.
Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5.

"This is one of the best games out there, it's a classic. Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome. Buy it you won't regret it.",5.0
"I spent many years of my childhood happily addicted to this amazing game! playing other poplar N64 games I hated how in most of them, you can't wander all over the world and explore. But you can in this game :) I loved the first starting point level where you can just hang out as Banjo and explore where he lives, all the cute characters were a blast and I loved going on little adventures for them. but oh no! Banjo's little sister has been kidnapped by the evil witch! the pursuit of her is epic, and I love her good witch sister whose turned on her and tells you embarrassing secrets about her :) whoever created this game had a wonderful mind. I LOVED how one of the last levels is a game show where they quiz you on every little detail about the game :) one thing I hate about modern state of the art games is how it takes maybe two days to defeat the whole game. but banjo kazooie took months to defeat! and in that time I learned every single detail and aced the game show wonderfully :) and I can't even get started on all the levels, I could write a novel about how amazing all the levels are. I think one of my favorite things about this hasn't was mumbo turning you into amazing little creatures! omg it was wonderful. other N64 games just cannot compare. they don't make games like this any more.",5.0

"This is this is the first strategy game I have ever liked that I played, so maybe I'm partial to it ... but I love it!  I don't understand why some  people are so crushed when their ""favorite"" game series puts out  a bad game.  It's not that big of a deal.  For all you Red Alert buffs, Red  Alert 2 will be out soon so chill out for a minute.  There are a ton of  different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely  addictive.  Once you get the basics down ... the sky is pretty much the  limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game.  It  will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by Westwood.  The  online play is great and easy to use.  I haven't even played the single  player game because I just can't get enough of the online play.  So unlike  the other people who are saying they hate it (but they probably still play  it often), I like it an awful lot.",5.0
"Well, it seems that those idiots who gave TS a low rating was because they  thought TS reused Red Alerts units. That is completely wrong . TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee  aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i don't think so.  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is  about (no real actors - jus  bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games.  Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old C&C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they haven't been looking for, they disgrace the game.  We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if you're a  serious fan of C&C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have remembered.",5.0
"I have noticed that most people believe that Tiberian Sun is a sequel to C&C: Red Alert. This is not true. Red Alert was written as a PREQUEL to the original C&C and happens during WW2. Tiberian Sun then picks up a  little while after where C&C left off. The best twist in the game is  that Kain (NOD leader) is back, although the truth about his death in  C&C 1 is a little mixed up. The graphics have been improved  tremendously, the maps are larger, and new awesome units have been added.  The storyline is not as intriguing as the other two C&C games, but it  is a good story line also. In my opinion, Tiberian Sun was the best RTS of  1999. If you have the other C&C games, it is a must own. If you don't  have the other C&C games, or are debating between Red Alert and  Tiberian Sun, BUY THIS ONE!",5.0
This games offers a sense of adventure and fun you could never find in today's generation that mainly focuses on shooting and action,5.0

"This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters. They are are a blast even now, though it takes playing it now to realize how clumsy the camera system on these games was. I don't know how I managed to get all the notes while playing on the N64, I find it next to impossible now to have the patience to navigate some of the last levels with the slowness and precision needed to prevent falling off a cliff and having to spend 5 minutes getting back up, or worse, dying, in which case you lose all your notes in the level and have to collect them from scratch.  Thus I  quicksave often.

I guess I no longer am as good as I once was at these games.  Still, this is one of my N64 favorites from my high school years basically.",5.0

"This is a fun game. I got the Platinum edition and it has a few ectra things. Things! Not actual game options. No, it has the same game options as the normal edition. But the graphics are a MAJOR improvement over Red  Alert and Command and Conquer. The story is again very cool. The between  mission videos are very interesting and cool looking, especially the one  with the GDI Mammoth Mk. 2 stomping everything Nod, though there is a lack  of Nod end mission videos. You can easily modify the rules file to change  the game yourself if you get board after playing it non-stop 12 hours a  day, or you can download game mods from the many different web sites made  for it. Some of those are as follows: [...]  [...] [...] [...] or the last I know,  [...] . This is a cool strategy game. The skirmish mode can be  very hard if you adjust the game setting that way, the multiplayer options  are the easiest I have seen out of the Trilogy,(which I now own), the  missions are not too too hard, but if you get stuck, just visit any of the  above sites and get a walkthrough or two or three. You don't need any $150  graphics accelerator either. This is a fun stratagy game.",5.0
"Even though the graphics are not great, the gameplay and control is awsome. This game really puts you into it. It is a good action and strategy game.  It's one of the best, believe me",5.0
This was a great game. I had alot of fun playing it. I almost beat the NOD campaign. My favorite unit is the cyborg commando. The multiplayer is great. I don't think this game has any cons.,5.0
"Whether you've owned a N64 or not, chances are you've heard of the name 'Banjo-Kazooie' at least once while going through videos, looking through gaming sites or just looking up lists of games from systems you knew of but didn't have etc. If you have seen the name mentioned anywhere, then you may have also read reviews of the game, which, in majority, were very, very, very good. And there's a good reason for it, too.

You start the game with a scene of a little girl (who is a bear) talking to a mole (his name is Bottles and becomes your guide once the gameplay itself starts). During the scene, you also see a large structure, along with a bridge and mountain (Spiral Mountain). The structure is the face of a witch, the main enemy of the game whose name is Gruntilda (or Grunty, for short). She flies on her broomstick and swoops down and catches Tooty (girl bear; Banjo's sister). As you may guess, this sets up the plot for the game. As Banjo and Kazooie, you must save Tooty. Seem like a boring game to you just by its plot? Well, guess again.

The game's graphics are absolutely amazing. Whether it's a cutscene or not, the graphics are just great. The sound is also very well done, too. The main theme song for the game is extremely memorable and will probably get stuck in your head. This isn't the only one that will do so, most likely, though.

The characters are also very fun and lovable. They're great to look at (their designs are very good) and even though they never talk, they make one sound, but it's repeated to represent their conversations, obviously. Even with this in mind, the voices are pretty lovable as well. It's not like one sound repeated at the same note, you can easily tell that the sounds may be a bit deeper and higher at times, so it keeps it less boring.

The gameplay is awesome. It responds flawlessly, but you'll quickly find out that once you try diving underwater and try swimming around, that it's very hard. Despite all of this games perfections, the underwater swimming controls are horrid. In a world called 'Clanker's Cavern', you must jump and swim through about 10 (maybe less) rings under a set time limit. Think it sounds easy? Guess again, you could get hit by these tentacle-like things, which could/will flip you completely around and just from that, you've probably wasted too much time to get through the rest of the rings. Also, when flying, you'll get a move in Freezeezy Peak (another world), which lets you do a charge or attack that soars you across the air and hitting something in direct contact. There are giant snowmen in this world with hats that are your target. If you try to aim at the hats, you'll most likely soar straight over the snowman completely. This takes practice and lots of it. I haven't even succeeded in this move, but I may be able to pull it off soon.

Oh, and you don't have to follow the worlds in any certain order, which is really cool. Except the first world, you must go there to begin everything. You also collect jigsaw pieces (commonly referred to as ''Jiggies'') and musical notes that are a necessity to beat the game. But you aren't required to collect every single one of them. You just need enough to get through the game. There are 10 jiggies and 100 musical notes in each world (in case you wondered). Getting to choose where you want to go first is pretty cool. You don't feel, I guess you could say, ''restrained'' because you must go to one certain world before another every time. You could get two jiggies and sixty-three notes in one world, then 10 jiggies and 5 musical notes in another. It's very cool to go at your own pace instead of having to do something before another or having to collect every single thing, which I know can be a pain.

All in all, the game is very fun, gameplay is, for the most part, flawless, the characters are well-designed, lovable and memorable, along with the music and the challenge is nice. Highly recommended and very deserving of its praise.

Pros:
-Great graphics, characters, music, challenge and gameplay.
-Being able to go through the game at your own pace is very nice.

Cons:
-The underwater swimming controls are horrible and annoying
-The flying 'spear' move is very hard to master. Takes a LOT of practice.

"The game is just awesome. Although the game can be quite challenging, the game is still fun to play! The music, sound effects, and the graphics are just awesome. I think Grant Kirkhope did a good job on the music. Anyways, here's the plot:

The story starts off in Spiral Mountain, where lives a heroic brown honey bear named Banjo, a red, and loud-mouthed bird called Kazooie, Banjo's bird partner, and an evil witch called Gruntilda (Grunty). Gruntilda kidnaps Banjo's sister, Tooty who is then taken up to Grunty's lair, where Gruntilda then wants Tooty's beauty, where Grunty will ""make herself young and Tooty old"" (She is taken into a machine, where Gruntilda's servant Klungo function the machine). Eventually, Banjo & Kazooie rescue her from the evil clutches of Gruntilda. As Banjo And Kazooie defeat Gruntilda during the final fight, Gruntilda is buried underground until the sequel (Banjo-Tooie).

Anyways, here's the areas:

Spiral Mountain - This is where you start your adventure, where you meet Bottles the short-sighted mole. He will teach you basic moves if anyone is playing the game for the first time.

Gruntilda's Lair - This is where you advance to stages/worlds throughout the game. This also includes the final boss fight in the game. You find your first jiggy as you first enter her lair. You also learn how to open note doors.

Here's the stages/worlds:

Mumbo's Mountain - A mountain-themed place where you first find notes, jinjos, and other stuff. You will learn 3 moves that consist of these: Beak buster, Egg shooting, and talon trot (Use this to go up steep slopes). You will also meet Mumbo Jumbo, the shaman who will transform you into certain creatures if you have enough Mumbo tokens. Mumbo's transformation is the termite.

Treasure Trove Cove - A island-themed place where you learn how to fly and to use the shock jump. The place is also home of the sandcastle floor, which is a code room where you can enter codes (Do NOT enter any cheat codes, or your game file data is lost for good, you will have to redo the game all over again.). Spell BANJOKAZOOIE to get the jiggy.

Clanker's Cavern - This includes rusty pipes, dirty water, and you'll find some underwater challenges and razor-sharp obstacles eventually inside Clanker. Complete the hoop mini game to get a jiggy. This is also home of Clanker who is a trash compacting fish who is stuck underwater and eventually his teeth hurt (shoot his gold teeth to get a jiggy).

Bubblegloop Swamp - This a dark and dangerous place where all the piranhas occupy the water. You will also learn how to use the wading boots, use those to go through dangerous areas you cannot survive in. You can find 2 mini games in this stage. Win both of them for jiggies. Mumbo's transformation is the crocodile that can walk through piranha water.

Freezeezy Peak - This is the most coldest place you can be in, the water is dangerously cold so avoid going in there. You also meet Boggy the polar bear who has swallowed a jiggy and lost their children's presents. If you can retrieve all 3 of their presents, they will give you a jiggy (do that last before you leave this stage). If you can find Boggy's sled, Boggy will be ready to do a couple of races. Win both of them to get a couple of jiggies as the prizes. Mumbo's transformation is the walrus. You'll learn a new move - The Beak Bomb, an airborne move.

Gobi's Valley - This is an ancient-themed place where you'll find sand where only the sand eels survive. The desert is over a 100 degrees, and there's only one place to find water. The place is the home of Gobi the camel where you must free him from the boulder, then get Gobi to give water to Trunker, and finally get Gobi to give you an empty honeycomb piece. There's some mummified enemies there. You'll learn one more move here, you'll learn the turbo talon tron where you can access to other areas where you don't have time to enter.

Mad Monster Mansion - This is the spookiest place where it's really a ""nightmare"". The dead is risen. Where you'll find ghosts, skeletons, bats, and lot more! You'll find a graveyard with a haunted church. Enter the BANJOKAZOOIE code again for a jiggy. You'll find monsters from portraits and you'll find Loggo the toilet where you'll find a jiggy inside when you're flushed down. Mumbo's transformation is the pumpkin that can fit through narrow areas, and can even walk through dangerous areas.

Rusty Bucket Bay - The most challenging level in the game, where you encounter the legendary ship: The HMS Gruntilda, known as ""The Rusty Bucket""! Everything there has oily water, and dangerous areas! If you're careful, you'll go down with da ship! You're also about to find some tolls, feed them with eggs to explore areas easier to avoid oily water.

Click Clock Wood - This is a 4-1 place where each 4 areas consist of 4 seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter). If you really think you can make it through this place, the stage is still challenging of all. You'll meet a plentiful amount of characters here including familiar ones that return that eventually move on to the sequel.

Here's some stuff you can find:

Jiggies - 10 in each area, stage/world, 100 in the entire game. Collect 10 in each stage and you will progress through the game. You cannot make it through the game without them because you need them to unlock stages. To unlock stages, just stand on the jigsaw-shaped podium and press the A button to fill in one space. The Z button fills in all the spaces simultaneously.

Notes - 100 in each stage, 900 in the entire game. Try collecting all 100 notes before leaving the stage to unlock note doors.

Jinjos - There is 5 on each stage. Rescuing all of them equals a jiggy.

Eggs - You can use those as ammo

Red feathers - These are needed for Kazooie to fly.

Gold feathers - These are needed for invulnerability. The move is called ""Wonderwing"".

Witch Switch - Perform a beak buster there and either an obstacle to access to a jiggy will be enabled or just a jiggy will appear somewhere in Grunty's Lair.

Molehills - You'll find Bottles there, and he will teach you special moves in the game.

Warp Cauldrons - Those appear in Grunty's lair, activate the same cauldron color to create a network of warping shortcuts (Now you won't have a lot of running around in the lair so you can avoid monopolizing your time playing).

Brentilda - She appears in various parts of the lair. She gives you secrets about Gruntilda. Write down everything she says so you can be able to answer questions near the end of the game.

Cheato - A spellbook who can give you 3 codes to enter in the sandcastle in Treasure Trove Cove. The codes you get are ""BLUEEGGS"", ""REDFEATHERS"", and ""GOLDFEATHERS"".

Mumbo Tokens - Collect a plentiful amount of tokens for Mumbo transformations.

Empty Honeycomb pieces - There are 6 in spiral mountain, and 2 in each of the 9 stages. 24 in the entire game. Collect 6 for an extra piece of energy.

Honey Energy - Collect those to boost your energy. Defeat enemies for get those.

Extra lives - Are you running low on lives? Collect these to maintain your gameplay!

Here's the rest:

Grunty's Furnace Fun - This is a quiz show where you must answer questions correctly. Joker cards allow you to skip a square, so please conserve them or they'll be gone before you know it. Be careful with death questions or you lose one life. Win the quiz and you've rescued Tooty.

Final Boss - This is a 5 step procedure. Rat a tap her first, then shoot 3 eggs at her per side, then beak bomb at her a few times, then shoot eggs to have the Jinjos hit her, and finally, activate the Jinjonator shoot eggs multiple times (be careful, Grunty can shoot fireballs at you, dodge just before you're hit).

Secret -

Bottles Bonus - 7 challenges. Go into Spiral Mountain, enter Banjo's house, go into the right spot at the portrait of Bottles, and you're off to play a mini game. Becoming harder, the picture moves. To make matters worse, you may need to rotate pieces. So at the start, every piece will totally scramble and become hard to master due to the picture moving. You receive codes to enter in the sandcastle in Treasure Trove Cove.

Stop N Swop - Enter the codes in the sandcastle in Treasure Trove Cove. You'll have 6 eggs, and an ice key. If you collect your first Stop N Swop item, the ""Stop N Swop"" menu will appear in the ""View Totals"" screen (check that screen if you collected everything before leaving).

Overall, I absolutely do recommend this game for any Rare fans or have ever played any adventure games. It's just the best N64 adventure game ever. In fact, it's the best adventure game I played in my life. :D",5.0

"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made, Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too), its rich, colorful and very addicting, The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!), and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous, I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement, its just really cool, this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player, Im serious if you don't have this, your missing out BIG time.

"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play ""collect the item"" games, but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with, honestly and unfortunately, a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time, with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game, and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this, but they just don't make them like this anymore!
On a side note, the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha.",5.0
"I really love this game a LOT.  It was a LOT of fun.  Me and my older sister just LOVED playing this game.  But then because of space issues and because nobody plays Nintendo 64 anymore.  I got rid of Nintendo 64 and all of it's games.  Again, nobody plays Nintendo 64 anymore.  It's an old out-dated system and all the new games would go to Nintendo Wii or 3DS. :(  So, I really hope to see this game resurface.  I would like to play it all over again. and I don't see how anybody could get tired of this game.  There were so many games that I loved in 64 that I would love to see all over again.  The younger generation have no idea how much they are missing out on the good old games. :(",5.0
"Goldeneye 007, Killer Instint, The Donkey Kong Country series, Conker, Diddy Kong Racing....those were the good ol' days when Rare was still relevant.  Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility.  And in my opinion, the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games (kazooie & tooie) on Nintendo 64.  Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous ""Banjo Threeie"" to life on any console!!",5.0

I would recommend this game to anyone who has a N64.",5.0
"i LOVE this game, the stuff is done so perfectly and near flawless. here is my review of the game so i'll sort the different aspects into sections.
  PLOT: 8/10 the plot is relatively simple, you have to rescue your sister, who has been kidnapped by an evil witch who wants to steal her beauty. kinda cliche, but pulled off very nicely, the witch Gruntilda constantly speaks in rhymes, and the she sends you threats while you go through the hub (her lair), and taunts you, and even tries to trick you with false offers. and as you go on she gets less and less sure of herself, so the plot is really a ""between the lines"" sort of deal. not to mention that there is even a ""game over"" video, rather than a screen, so you see what happens when you fail.
  GRAPHICS: 10/10 while they may not be so great anymore, these graphics were really the best you could find back then. they were even better than the PS1 games, which were really something because the only other N64 games that came close to the PS1 games required the expansion pack, so you can tell they worked hard on the graphics because this one doesn't need the expansion.
  SOUND: 10/10 along with sick graphics Banjo-Kazooie still has some of the best sounds in video game history. i mean, the two main characters are named after instruments, right? the songs are all memorable and each one has a certain feeling too. Spiral mountain has a lot of happy memories, while Mad Monster Mansion could fill your mind with fear and sadness. also, the effects have great sounds too, when you find a 1-up, when you kill a monster, when a monster hits you, and etc.
  GAMEPLAY: 9.99/10 what is a game without good gameplay, a bad one, that's what. luckily, Banjo-Kazooie has some of the best gameplay you'll ever find in a platformer game. you can run, punch, roll, and even fly, there's even more things than Super Mario 64, or even Galaxy for that matter. also, as the game goes on you learn new moves, get more upgrades, and you can even transform into other animals with help from the shaman Mumbo Jumbo. you'll learn a move called the ""talon trot"" which helps you move much faster while you're in a hurry, and even before you learn that you can always roll, then when you're about to stop, jump. it's almost as fast and really easy to do. the only thing that kept me from giving it a 10, was the swimming. you can hold A to swim slowly, or B to let Kazooie use her wings to make you speed off. the problem though is that holding A makes you go extremely slowly, and holding B comes in short bursts of speed. not only that but letting go of B is like sliding on ice, it's extremely hard to aim where you want to go and once you let go of the button, you start slowly stopping, and this can be very annoying in Clanker's cavern, where you'll spend a lot of time in 70 feet deep sewage water, because that is probably the worst place to drown.
  OVERALL: 10/10 overall, this game purely deserves the 10/10 and if they make a new Banjo-Kazooie game that somehow comes out on a nintendo console, with just as good factors, and they have better swimming, i'll call it the best game ever.",5.0
"If Mario 64 was good than Banjo was Mario perfected.
Amazing game.
Another gem from years ago that I played start to finish multiple times.
Amazing levels.
Perfect control.
Great but hokey music.

Some people were annoyed by the ""voices"".
I thought they were hilarious.
The camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was 3D platforming in it's beginning and really, the camera is about as perfect as a 3D platforming camera can be.

To summarize...
Great gameplay.
Awesome graphics for the time.
An ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end.
(A real bummer that the two games DIDN'T link after all).
That's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N64.
Otherwise....another great platformer from the golden age of platforming, collect a thons.

"Rare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games. Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review.

First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.

In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected.

There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver.

I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman.

I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality.

What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.",5.0

"I bought Banjo-Kazooie when I was nine years old, in the summer of 1998. I am 21 years old now and it is still one of my favorite games. New games just don't stand a chance to the old ones, in my view. BK has a little something for everyone. The graphics are so beautiful they will blow you away. The game play is challenging. I was disappointed to see that some reviewers said this game was just for children. In fact, I don't think a young child, say, under 8, could find everything in the game. It is fun enough for younger players, but challenging enough for adults. The story of the game involves a bear named Banjo, who finds out is sister Tooty was kidnapped by the evil witch Gruntilda. Banjo takes his bird friend Kazooie and they set off to go find Tooty. On the way they climb a mountain infested with termites (Mumbo's Mountain), explore a beautiful, briny beach (Treasure Trove Cove), swim through a dark, underground cave (Clanker's Cavern), wade through a treacherous swamp (Bubble Gloop Swamp), brave a freezing cold Arctic world (Freezeezy Peak), discover the ancient pyramids (Gobi's Valley), run away from ghosts in a comical haunted house (Mad Monster Mansion), visit a polluted, dingy shipyard (Rusty Bucket Bay), and see all four seasons in one gorgeous, but dangerous, forest (Click Clock Woods), and the adventures don't end there! There is also a quiz game show that you must solve to get Tooty, and then you must face the witch herself. This game has surprises around every corner and is never boring. The majority of new games do not compare to BK in the slightest. It has withstood the test of time to me. Banjo-Kazooie is still one of the best, and I hope it will be rediscovered by players young and old for many years to come.",5.0

"Banjo-Kazooie is an excellent addition to your N64 game collection. It's very similar to Super Mario 64, but beats it in pretty much every aspect. The worlds are bigger, there are more things to do, the graphics are more crisp. Additionally, the game is funny! There are more characters and funny interactions than in Super Mario 64. This is a good game for children and adults. A basic reading level is necessary to understand character dialogue and jokes. One player, 3 save slots.",5.0

"Positive:
+ gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time
+ worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content
+ music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots
+ sharp controls that work well for the most part

Negative:
- you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world
- camera doesn't always give you the best view you need

Super Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.

Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.

The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.

Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.

But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.

Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times.

One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool.

Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.

"I'm not going to fill this review with stories or complaints. Here's the basics.
Pros
- Great, fun adventure game
- Original, good controls, lots of moves to learn
- Tons of different enemies, some bosses, and lots of challenges
- Easy enough for anyone to play
- Funny and interesting, yet family friendly
- Lots to explore, many different worlds, and a massive land connecting
them
-Dialogue is well thought out
-Many characters to meet
-Collectible searching makes for replayability

Cons
-Maybe too easy
-No storyline, a simple save the girl story, no plot advancement
-Can be childish and stupid (Everything is alive and talking)
-The sound of characters talking is a looped annoying sound
-Although childish, there are random difficulty spikes
-Timing on attacks seems off, enemies can score multiple hits against you
-Too many different things to collect at once

I love this game, and I strongly recommend it to anyone in the mood for a strong adventure game, with few true flaws. Anyone can find this game appealing, and it's great to wind down and just have fun with.",5.0
"I really love this game that is quite similar in concept to Super Mario 64. Though it is a lot simpler than its successor Banjo Tooie (in that one there are many types of eggs plus you can change characters) but it is a lot more fun. The successor had a lot more dialog that you had to wade through.

The final battle with Grunty is one of the toughest obstacles I have encountered in a video game and I still have not figured out a way to beat her without the unlimited gold feather cheat.",5.0

"In this game you can be turned into animals by a witch doctor, hunt for treasure, soar through a giant sized forest, and even save your captured sister while doing so. Grunty, a wicked witch with a knack for rhyming, has taken your sister to stael her beauty and make it her own. You must find puzzle pieces and recreate paintings , which in turn allows you to enter the beautifully rendered worlds packed with fun and imagination. This game is a must have for any video game enthusiast, and can be enjoyed for hours on end.",5.0
"After Rareware turned GoldenEye into a system-seller for the Nintendo 64, it broke out again with the action-platformer Banjo-Kazooie. An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjo's sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her. Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back.

The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage.

This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid. A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel, Banjo Tooie.",5.0
"This is one game that will test your skills, on how to figure things out, but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted mole's help. One thing i like about this game is that when Bottle & Kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier. This is a pretty cool game, it's worth buying. I had fun playing it, i will buy it.

It's a fun multi-world game featuring Mario who jumps into each level as a painting in the castle. Each painting contains a couple levels to complete of the same world.

"Banjo-Kazooie is an action adventure game in the style of Super Mario 64. However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9).

The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much. Once more, I highly recommend this game.",5.0
"I have never played anything like this since. Everything from Sly  Racoon, to Ratchet and Clank, owe it to this.

Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo's sister to hey layer, miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.

Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever.",5.0
"All in all, this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course, it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female, evil castle, jump on enemies, etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that, occasionally, it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president, they did so for a good cause, and a damn good game.",5.0

"This game is a masterpiece!  I'm no die-hard Nintendo fan by any means.  Very recently, I finally played this game for the first time.  Every level is creative, and visually appealing.  The graphics are top-notch for N64.  It plays very well, but most importantly it's a lot of fun!  Perhaps the best N64 game out there!",5.0
"Now that Banjo & Kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming. HOPEFULLY! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever. In fact it's one of the most amazing games in any genre period. It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.",5.0
"Rareware - words fail me. Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation.
I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody.
The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic.
The story goes...
The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The ""cute"" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit ""cuter"" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's ""cuteness"" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game.
Well, I hope you enjoy this game. Thanks for reading this review, and until next time...

"I grew up with Nintendo and was a pre-teen when the first Nintendo system came out. N64 was first purchased for my son when he was four years old. It took him a while to understand all the moves and the console pretty much sat on the shelf. However, this past year, he got into playing Banjo-Kazooie and really had a blast. At the same time, my three-year-old daughter caught on to it. There are also times where I would sit and play the game as well. The graphics are really cool and I especially love the dialogue shared with Boggles the mole. The moves were actually easy enough for my daughter to learn and even she's taught me a thing or two. So far, we have only reached the Treasure's Cove, but we are looking forward to the other worlds.",5.0
"I absolutely love this game! I remember as a young child, my siblings and I would wait like ticking time bombs until dad got home from work to play Mario Kart with us! Time marched on, different interests like football and girls came and went. Now fast forwarding to college, my friends and I still have Mario Kart 64 playing on the TV from time to time!

I think everything about the game from level design, to the items, to the sounds and music is perfect... Especially battle mode. For some reason, the newer Mario Kart battle mode game types try appealing us with coin collecting and massive AI scrums, but I don't find it that much fun. I love how the Mario Kart 64 battle mode keeps the objective simple and tests each players wit and skill against each other. Battle mode: Three balloons for each player, last player with balloons wins! How you win is up to you, the game lets you decide. It leaves me feeling like I earn each match I play, and is winning is big bragging rights against your friends!

Skill wise I have found this game is easy to learn and understand for all players. That being said, Mario Kart driving is a skill that is best practiced often. The other day my little brother and I decided to pick up another game after a Mario Kart lull... and Ill just say Bowser's castle has treated him better!

"4 Simple words to describe one of the most fun and addictive  games ever created for the nintendo 64 system...
 Banjo Kazooie has an entertaining story line which helps to create excitement in every level of the game, You start off on spiral mountain where the sleepy bear naps through his little sisters kidnapping, When he awakes Kazooie is on the floor and knows what has happened, You meet up with bottles the mole and he offers assistance which is one of the most nicley done tutorials I have ever been through. also, its easy to understand. ^.^
  This game offers to you what Mario 64 did not.... Extreme fun and days, weeks, months of gameplay with better characters, levels and places to go. As my brother went and sold our banjo kazooie 2 years ago I have gotten that Banjo addiction back somehow and I have searched 5 stores, none have had it . >.<  I turned to the ToysRus website to see if its even sold still and yes it is but its out of stock, it asked if I would write a review and I thought, why not...

"When I first saw this colorful little game at my friends houseand gave it a try I was shocked. THe game was so cool but I [wasn'tvery good] at it. Now I was never an expret at video games but I wanted to do a little better than that! SO I went and rented (and later bought) the game and spent the whole summer trying to beat it. I was hooked.
Banjo-Kazooie Is an enertaining game. In a way it retells the story of Snow White in it's own.... creative little way. The evil Witch Gruntilda is jelous of Tooty's (Banjo's Sister) beauty so she kidnaps her and traps her in ther Lair. When Banjo and Kazooie find out about this they race to her lair.

"One of the best Nintendo 64 games ever made. The graphics aren't that hot, but hey, the gameplay is outstanding. Steal tanks and explore the 007 world. Highly reccomended.",5.0
"this is by far one of the best first person shooter games ever made. when i first bought it, i was stuck playing it for eight hours. then switched to multiplayer, which was just fantastic; the gameplay is awesome, and the levels are unforgettable; my favorites (facility, jungle, cradle, dam, streets and bunker 1 and 2.) Then, a good five years ago i bought this book which gives you all the cheats. I had more fun playing this game than any other 1st person-shooter game, after Halo 1 and 2. This goes straight to the top of my James Bond 007 video game collection, along with Agent Under Fire, NightFire, Everything or Nothing, and GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. I'd highly recommend to any James Bond or video game fan.",5.0
"Based on the popular 17th James Bond film,the Best James Bond game ever. You Get to be James,Natalya,Oromov,Boris and other James Bond characters from ever movies even. Also with Levels from the movie and lots of cool weapons. This game was and is a knockout,an action packed blast,there's no better action game franchise than 007. I Hope they put the new Goldeneye on PS2, thats what I have now. I recommend Goldeneye, only that you might not find it now since the game systems that are selling right now are PS2,Gamecube and XBOX, and N64 goes back to 1996, but if you never played this than you should and get with the program, I'm a Secret Agent and who hasn't played it isn't even an agent, so fight the enemy,save the girl and save the day as Britan's top Spy James Bond 007 in GOLDENEYE.",5.0
This game inspired me to get N64. This is the best shooter game ever and has great action.  To this day i still play the game conatintly over and over.  This game made N64 what it is today.  The only bad thing about the game is the graphics but who cares it was an early game of N64.  If you have N64 but don't have Goldeneye go out and buy it.  It doesn't madder if you have all the new stuff like Gamecube or PS2 this is what made all that.  Goldeneye is forever.,5.0
"Golden eye, games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye. Based on the movie, the game is truly hard hiting gameplay action that is super fun. This game is a very great shooting game. One of the best shooting game of all time, golden eye has a great story, and goes along with the new 007 games that are coming out. Redifine the origin by playing this game if you haven't. Sure the graphics aren't that great but dude, its nitendo 64. They should remake this game and other classic 64 games for nitendo gamecube. If you still play 64 (god have mercy) you will also love perfect dark.
If your buying this game, for some reason you should add perfect dark. Same game play action, but for some reason I love ""Perfect Dark"" better. But thats me.....",5.0
"Ever since I purshased GOLDENEYE 007 on the old N64, I became highly addicted to it, like many other gamers around the world. I also have to thank this game as well, because it made me a hardcore James Bond fan.
This is the best first-person shooting game ever! Although dated, the detail of this game is amazing. There's over 14 levels of shooting! My favorite missions are the first level, the Silo mission, the Train mission, and the very last level.
Highly recommended game; it fuels the senses! If you like James Bond, or any type of video game, get it! Mostly all of you have.",5.0
"We now have games like True Crime, Gran Theft Auto 3/Vice City and James Bond: Everything or Nothing, and yet no matter how many games that come out that feature good graphics and bullet time and slow motion and all of that stuff, goldeneye still ranks at the top of my favorite all time shooter list.  I mean face it.  It revolutionized the way games were made.  I still have my copy of goldeneye.  Although i don't play it a lot anymore, that doesn't mean i don't think very highly of it.  Yeah there are a lot of pretty good games out there, but goldeneye set the standard.  Let goldeneye live on like the bond legacy itself.",5.0
"Goldeneye 007 is the best game for the Nintendo 64. Its an amazing game, and its still fun to play today. There was a game called Perfect Dark that was similar to this and came out later, but this is the far better game. Tons of great guns and gadgets are here, and the gameplay is awesome. Its not the best first person shooter ever(Halo for Xbox is), but its still one of the best. The graphics aren't the best ever right now, but at the time, in 1997 or so, they were real great. The music is good. It has a mysterious sound to it for some reason. This game has some of the best levels in any game, and it controls great. Multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever. At the time it had the best multiplayer around. It might not now, since there are games like Halo and Diablo II, but like I said, it was the best at the time. There aren't really any negatives. All hail to the best game on N64, and one of the best games ever.",5.0
Goldeneye is the best game for 64 and is one fo the best games out there.  though it does not have the best graphics or can sometimes be unrealistic it is neverending fun.  random guys just keep coming and do stupid things and thats very entertaining.  you can get in a take and nfinate numbers of guys come after you and you can just blow them up. and there are mysterys like on the dam and you look across the water and see that guard tower can you get there? whats in there? no one knows but me and my friends alwasy tell each other are theories.  anyways this game is better then alot of gamecube and ps2 games. it is second to only Halo.  if you like this game get Perfect dark also but you have to get that gay expansion pack. o ya and multiplayer. thats fun to because you can beat all your friends and make fun of them. buy this game.,5.0

Are these people nuts there are Zelda games at the stores everwhere but you cannot get an expansion pack to run them i have owned a game for over a month and cannot use it. Please pass message on to Nintendo. Peed off in Terrace.,1.0
"Nintendo has hit the jackpot with the new expansion pak for nintendo 64.  The gamers are the ones being hurt here.  Why make an expanson pak, which isn't very noticable in graphics and game play??  Almost all popular new games being released require this pak, Perfect Dark needs one jsut to play the 1 player missions, the highlight of the game if you ask me.  TWINE also requires this pak, and i just do not have the time or MONEY$$ to add hardware to my 64.  I think they need to leave the 64 alone, and start workin on upgrades for the POWER CUBE.",1.0

This game will NOT work in Vista or 7 and you may and that is a MAY get it to work in XP . Windows 98 it will . So if you have a new fast start of the art computer your out of luck with this game . Their is NO patch or fix for it @ this time . This is pr Lucas Arts tech support . So for Vista and up your only going to get a cool box =( .,1.0
"This was a very interesting game, requiring a joystick. I wanted to play it, but it kept freezing up on my year 2000 PC with much more than the stated system requirements, video cards, etc. Lucas  Arts said I should try downloading some video patches that do not exist anymore (remember, my computer is years(?) beyond this product), but they warned me the patches could crash my computer. Gee, thanks for wasting my money.",1.0
"I am disappointed with this software. 7 of ten trials to run it have frozen my system.  I have a very capable computer with a an 866MHz processor, 256MB ram and 32MB Gforce nvidia AGP CARD. The game should  certainly work but it always ends up frozen. All  other games work  wonderfully. Many times you can't even start the game as it freezes in the  introduction. Take heed!",1.0
"To tell you the truth, I actually kind of liked the movie, StarWars Episode 1, but mainly for its' special effects. Special effectsare the only redeeming quality of this bomb of a game. You have a very bad perspective with a very short viewing distance. Enemies can shoot you from far off, while you can't even see them. On top of that, this game is way to short and repetitive with bad acting and the same boring story from the movie. Discourage George Lucas from making games like this anymore by not buying this game. Then maybe the new Jedi Knight: Obi Wan game will be as good as Jedi Knight. Hopefully.  END",1.0
Worst Sonic game ever. I hate this game. Works well as a frisbee or a drink coaster. Would rate zero stars if I could.,1.0

"This game is VERY annoying, and can get tiring easily. The thing I don't like about it is that it only lets you play game stages, and you get bored easily. The annoying thing about it is that when you move in a special way, like flying, the person that is moving will make a very annoying sound. I wouldn't buy it.",1.0
"all the bad reviews are right, the controls are confusing and the game becomes frustrating because you keep falling off cliffs without knowing why. then you have to go back to the last checkpoint and do the same thing again and again just hoping for the best and not really playing anymore.",1.0
"I was psyched at first when I got this... Then I played it past the third level and realized three things. One, it was all the same, two, the horribly quick and epileptic camera movements usually resulted in my death, and three, once I died, I lost all my rings and levels further angering me. Rent this game, don't buy it. Also don't expect anything thought provoking, listening to these characters speak and lead you hand and foot through the game is motivating enough to end your life slow and painfully.",1.0
"I was under the impression I ordered the English edition of this, but no I received the German edition, and it's the wrong region.",1.0
This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!,1.0

I realize the risk I run buying a used game but I feel like this is the most basic oversight. If you are going to sell a game in ""Good"" condition it should be listed that the internal battery needs replacing and should state that the game currently won't save. I will be attempting to fix this myself by replacing said internal battery but again, your product description should not say it's in complete working order when it indeed was not.",1.0

So I got this game from what I thought would be reliable dealer. It saved and it was great at first! But after a month or so all of a sudden my progress was gone!! I then realized that it wouldn't save if it was off for a little while so i had to keep it plugged it ALL the time. So stressful! I went so far in the game and of coarse i didn't notice it wasn't fully plugged in and my memory was gone. Well anyways i thought i'd share my experience.,1.0
"Ok, well. I've played pokemon before, and i love them. They're really fun and me and my brother enjoy it. The game even came in with fast shipping which was great!

And i know it isn't my Gameboy since i put it in my brother's gameboy to see the same thing happen! he plays the game too, and his games work fine!

"The game did not function as advertised. In fact, it did not function at all. The game would freeze at the opening ""Gameboy Color"" screen, and therefore was not usable. My brother's gameboy color has no problems with other games, so we know it is this one which is broken.",1.0

I've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time. I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes. Total Meltdown is the most frustrating  FPS I have ever played. The speed is so fast it is hard to move. Looking up and down is a chore. You use L1 and L2 to look up and down. Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible. Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible. Sound is bad as well. The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook(it is funny). The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations. Even the cutscenes are bad. Please try to avoid this game and save some cash.,1.0
"I was truely dissapointed in this particular Duke Nukem title.  Maybe had I not purchased 'Time to Kill' a year prior, my opinion on 'Meltdown', would have been different.  Meltdown is nowhere in the same catagory as 'Time to kill'.  The graphics to begin with are mediocre and better suited a less powerful system, i.e. the genesis or n64.  Second the controls are cumbersome and hard to operate.  There is no cycling of the weopons that made time to kill much more enjoyable.  My suggestions to any fans of the Duke Nukem titles to completely pass this one up and if possible borrow a friends copy of 'meltdown' so you can return it after the dissapointment.",1.0
"Honestly, there's nothing good about this game.  The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for.  The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation.  If you like games with good graphics, do not get this game.
  The gameplay isn't that great, also.  The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.
  I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: ""Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A."" Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.
  I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game.  This was bad.  Believe me.
  If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.
  If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.
  This game is not worth any money at all.",1.0
"I have this particular game for both PC and PSX, and the PC version is much better. The playstation version is choppy and has very akward controls. I truely believe that for 98 cents its a good buy, but the most fun idea would be to throw it out of a car bus ect. instead of actually playing it. for a good FPS get The World Is Not Enough, or Quake II",1.0

"Defective product---... Microsoft made these sticks back in the olden days when computers had game ports. They stopped making these and then brought them back into production. But by that time the computers no longer came with game ports so they supplied this stick with a UBS adapter (that is unique to this product- no standard UBS adapter will work). The seller did not include this adapter in the box and claimed that I was lying when I flied a complaint with Amazon..... In the end he sent me a UBS adapter that was made to fix some of these problems with these older devices but that did not work. So I returned the product.. He  told me to send it back to him ( when a product Is defective the merchant is required to pay return shipping but he did not want to do that) and he would pay for the shipping when he got it back. He did not do that and then told Amazon that the adaptor was in the box.... well yes, the third party adapter was in the box, the one that he sent me in an attempt to solve the problem.",1.0

When I was a kid, I didn't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful.  The control in this game is really bad, especially during the ring stages.  You'll just fly all over the place.  The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly, but you have a time limit, so you don't have time to move slowly.  When I got to a point where I could fight, it was like a maze and had no idea where to go.

But really, this game is just terrible. The first level requires Superman to fly through some rings, I think. I don't know much beyond that because I got bored, tossed the game aside and moved on to a better one.

Considering an awesome game like Angry Birds is $.99, I'd say that the cost/fun ratio of Superman is pretty poor and extremely expensive at about $1.99-2.99 + shipping. I could be wrong though... Level 2 could be gaming nirvana, I just couldn't bring myself to playing long enough to find out.",1.0

"This game was made by Titus Software, later known as Titus Interactive S.A, a French software publishing company that surely is the most sadistic company to ever live.

Did you know that The French made use of torture during the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62), creating an ongoing public controversy. Pierre Vidal-Naquet estimates that there were ""possibly hundred of thousands of instances of torture"" by the French military in Algeria.

It's even more fitting that the Etymology of the word Torture comes from the French, who derived it from Latin(of course) meaning to Twist.

And through Titus Software, the torture continues.  This time the Algerians have been spared in favor of the Nintendo 64 owning public.  Being Beaten severely or electrocuted will sound like a pleasant experience compared to playing this awful game.

How bad is this game?  Visuals- Bland.  Controls- Awful.  Gameplay- Repetitious.  So, if you like Bland, Awful, and Repetitious games you have just discovered the holy grail.

Your first challenge is to fly through rings.  That doesn't sound too bad.  But you have to be perfect.  You are Superman after all. Any error will lose you time in completing the Maze.  Why is Lex Luther Building a Maze for Superman?  Why does solving the maze save your friends?  Why wouldn't Luther say screw the Maze and just kill your friends?  Why?  Why?  Why?!  Get use to asking yourself that question.

Stage two you have to stop two cars.  I usually fail at this part and go back to starting stage one over again.  Not that it matters, because even if I succeed in stopping the cars, Stage 3 is the same as Stage 1.  YOU FLY THROUGH RINGS and race an invisible opponent.

WTF!

So Win or Lose during Stage 2 the outcome is exactly the same.  What happens after completing Stage 3?  I don't know.  I never played the game pass this part.  I don't think I even tried.  But I'll take a guess: You probably have to stop two cars from doing something.

After the task, you fly through MORE RINGS! After more rings, there is ANOTHER TASK!! The one task I couldn't complete is saving people from a tornado, so I just gave up. This game is really BAD, its the worst game I have ever played in my entire life!! Its bad as ET on the Atari 2600. I would NEVER recommend this game to anybody at all.  If your a hardcore video game collector, stay away from this game! Pick a different one!",1.0
"Because this game does not deserve even one star, not even a half-star.
There are more negative reviews for this game than there are blades of grass in my backyard, so it's hard to say something about it that has not been said yet. However, we ARE talking about a game so vile, it's enough to turn would-be comic collectors away from Superman.
The biggest complaint people have about this game is that the controls barely function. They're right: you press Z for liftoff, B for flight accleration, R for the breaks, and A to punch. Or in other words, press any button to make Superman have a delirious seizure. The control stick in this game offers some of the most hilariously bad character control: Superman is so twitchy, and spasms every time you try to turn. The only way to get anywhere at all while flying is to occasionally let up on the B button.
Believe it or not, the man of steel is even worse ON FOOT. He doesn't run to any destination, he Super Struts, and VERY SLOWLY. The punching is so awkward to use, delayed, and has such a short reach, you could be within kissing distance of an enemy and still take damage before you get to hit them. I have died numerous times because of this pathetic attack, but besides some his superpowers, it's his only true means of attack.
Don't even get me started about the graphics and sound; they're horrendous. Superman looks like a blue turd with little red logs for feet, the fog is only there to disguise the fact that Metropolis is shockingly undetailed and boring, the enemies are mostly bland robots and shadowy midgets, and the music? It's just... not there. You know how most games have at least one catchy tune? You could play with the sound off, and not miss anything. In fact, if you dare to play this game, I recommend that's what you do: mute the TV, and turn on some Gorillaz or ZZ Top.
I can't keep count of all the bugs in this game: when you try to throw cars or robots, sometimes they freeze in place, and they are never thrown in the direction you were facing. Robots apparently choose when they want to explode, whether it's when they're cast onto the ground, in midair, or before even leaving your hands; and it's even randomized if Superman takes any damage from the explosion at all. The Man of Steel often gets stuck on walls that are at least a yard or so away, which makes flying indoors just to get to where you need to go faster a nightmare. There was also a glitch I exploited by FALLING THROUGH THE FLOOR. This game's whole design is a terrifying mess.
So, all in all, Superman 64 is a terrible game, and I can only recommend it to people who are considering taking up game programming just so that they know what not to do.",1.0
"Before you play this game, prepare yourself for an incredible adventure. This is not your typical, run of the mill game that you can play in front of mama. This is a game that strikes fear into the very heart of the fearless. Shake in terror as Superman flies through rings at a breakneck speed. Gawk in horror at the 1 dimensional cut scenes that blind you with their brilliant colors (all two of them). Stare in amazement as Superman flies straight through the buildings of Metropolis. If Kryptonite were downloaded onto a cartridge, this game would be the result.

The most frightening aspect of this game is the unbelievable gameplay. I can't possibly describe the horror of gripping a Nintendo 64 controller and having absolutely no control over what's happening on the screen. The first time Superman flies right when you're pushing the punch button, you will probably pee your pants. You might even slobber when Superman attacks...whatever that thing is. I think it's supposed to be Lex Luther, though it's hard to tell in all that Kryptonite fog. This is an excellent game to play if you're having problems with constipation.

The plot only adds one facet to a multi-faceted game. Jimmy and Louis are trapped in...Something and you're supposed to rescue them. Not even Alfred Hitchcock could imagine such an incredible, horror inducing plot. However, I can't help but wonder why Lex Luther, the most brilliant man in Metropolis, would throw rings into the sky. I guess he thinks that Superman will die of exhaustion or something.

As frightening as all of this is, it is no comparison to the cover of this game box. Just look at it! The first time I saw it, I wanted to climb back in mom's womb and stay there forever. The nasty, contorted image of Superman gritting his teeth is so terrifying that even Jack the Ripper would have given himself up after one glance. No, this is no game to buy for your 3 year old. Believe me, if you allow them to play this game, it will forever scar their minds and leave an imprint of devastation in their hearts for all eternity.",1.0

"Superman 64, after playing the game and reading the remarks made about this game - I question the existence of Titus why it was made!
Alright, on with the Review:
Graphics: Eye-bleeding! Don't look at them!
Controls: Don't start with me - they are slower than Molasses to make Supe perform his punches! Even the Multiplayer controls are near-unfinished!
Sound and Music: Ugh, don't question me -uninspiring; The Superman theme is nonexistent! Sound is low-budget, voice/acting is from the series but I'm definitely not in love with either them or this game!
Plot: Lex Luthor has trapped Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Prof. Hamilton in a virtual world with Kryptonite fog in it and Supe has to go in and rescue them while putting down the Super-Villains Luthor purposely put there.
Fun Factor: This is not fun! For one, neither I nor my brother can beat the first level.  Supe both flying and running moves slow - if you try to fly: You'll have only ten-percent control over it! Not to mention the objectives you do are only for monkeys, you've got a timer for most of your objectives, this game is repetitive above all else, you have a health meter, a meter for all of your special abilities minus flying and you're gonna have to really try to get over your anger and impatience to beat this game!
And so: This is one of the worst games I've played, it literally ruined the Superman experience, pick up Spider-Man for the PSX, N64 or Dreamcast and enjoy the greatness it has to offer!

"This game was soooo bad, I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from. I got it since I am a Superhero fan, but trust me, even if you are a diehard fan of Superman, resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free!!!!! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.
 When i first turned the game on, the people in the first level looked like an oil painting. And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings!!! Miss one ring and words show up that say,""Lex wins"" and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy's laugh.
I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at!!! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game!!!! 'sob'",1.0

"In ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", David Carradine described Superman as follows, ""Not a very good comic; not particularly well-drawn.""  Well, I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character, then the game must be cool too, right?  It's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system.  It must be good, since we're still talking about all these years later.

Seriously, there's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64.  You won't need any sort of defect warranty, because the second you flip the POWER switch, it works every time.  It's refreshing to buy an electronic device, knowing that it's electrical circuits will never fail you.

Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game...I like it when he flies.  Every time I pop in this cartridge, I'm even more eager to watch  the Christopher Reeve movies...all 4 of them.

The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint.  You see, there are bizarre, murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldn't be able to visualize.  For example, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to, um...a blurry contraption that kidnaps them; or does it imprison them?  I personally couldn't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois, because it's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes.  But isn't it neat to figure it out for yourself?  You see, because the graphics are so confusing and blurry, you get to keep playing again to unearth the game's secrets.  And don't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time, either.  It's a tough game, and there are few games that equal its challenge.

What's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state.  I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7.  Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully.  You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do.  A free-spirited main character...brilliant!

Lastly, Superman's powers are present here.  He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath.  That's always neat, huh?  But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists.  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis.  How cool is that?  On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game.  I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman?  I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry.  The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.

SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming!

"I just wanted to get a good laugh what people had to say about this game. Sometimes we are so focused on what game is good or not we miss out on what is truly terrible in human history.

1. AIDS

2. Nuclear Weapons

3. Feministic empowerment.

4. AND this game.

N64 had its good run during its time. Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time truly destroyed all precedents and marked its place as the ""perfect"" game. Unfortunately N64 also has the worst game of all time too. Superman 64. I thought Fifth Element for PS1 was going to be the worst but waited a little longer and this game showed up.

The only purpose that this game can serve is for junk collection. You can probably buy it here and go ob ebay 20 years later and it will make a decent few bucks to say that ""Here was the worst piece of trash ever made in the software industry during the 20th century.""

I would definitely like to recommend this to college kids with N64. During a guy's night out when you're doinng drinking games, make the loser play this stuff for punishment.

As for Titus

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",1.0
"From reading the reviews, many of which are much more fun than the game, the consensus is that this is the worst video game ever.  That being the case, I think a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, Titus is in order.  The suit would simply give the game purchaser a refund of the original selling price along with postage to return the game.  Personally I'd  have the game permanently removed from the market.  Short of that, I'd make it illegal to sell the game without the guarantee of a 100 percent refund if the purchaser is dissatisfied.  At this point, whether they have the receipt, box, and instructions or not.  That way people who want to own this disgrace to the name Superman could still buy it even if they've been warned that it's video excrement.  As to rental stores, if someone still wants to rent it after it's been in the news because of the class action lawsuit then they can expect the worst and waste their rental fee.  You can't legislate everyone's happiness, but you can try to protect most people as best you can.  It's an idea anyway.  A lot better than the one Titus had in creating this game the way they did.",1.0
"First off, allow me to take a deep breath...

Of course this is going to be a very late review but this is a particular item that heavily deserves this type of attention. Before I go into my description, allow me to cast some clarity on a matter that needs desperate attention as well. For the individuals known as 'Siberian', 'Shaqfu' 'Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego or whatever your name is' and a the multiple 'a gamer' fellows, listen. There are doctors out there who can help you. With the technology and advancement we have today, your cases cannot be so far-fetched that you all must continue to live the miserable lives that you do. Perhaps you cannot resist being pathological liars or even megalomaniacs, but by reading the reviews each of you casted, you need help. It is probably safe to assume that you haven't any friends either as no true friend would allow you to make such idiots of yourselves with such horrid reviews as each of you gave on this pathetic excuse of a video game. But if all of you honestly felt that you were given thorough and complete reviews, then you are afterall simple-minded morons.

Now that I am done trashing them, onto this game. I have relatives that played this game that told me about their experiences. I believe they played it for about five minutes before yanking it out of the console and tossing it on the floor. Followed by taking it back to wherever they rented it, getting a refund and insulting it to or with whoever would listen too. After everything I have read, not just on this site but on others, it seems that it would be safe to say that this item was much the absolute worst video game in history. One particular website or gaming magazine gave it a 1.3 out of a possible 10. Undoubtedly the worst rating I've ever seen. Last year on the G4 TechTV awards, there was a greatest and worst video game moment provided. I don't quite recall everything well enough but other than this Superman game being nominated, there was a Star Trek game and another I cannot remember. This game won the award for being the worst game ever made followed by flashing 'YOU SUCK!' captions on the TV. Naturally Titus was insulted for days, weeks and even months thereafter. The graphics, gameplay, sound and all around structure may very well be the absolute worst you will have ever seen in a video game. It probably shares the same of entertainment today as what E.T. for the atari would and is to games what Streetfighter starring Jean-Claude Van Damme was to movies. A lowly, poor, pathetic insult that people will continue to recall and feel disgust in. Nothing about this game is anywhere near being decent. It was obviously made in a hurry and is flooded with mistakes, glitches and graphical problems. It never should have been made, but perhaps, on a final note, to those of us that have a copy of this 'item', maybe it should be kept somewhere safe, as a reminder that mankind can still create things of a disastrous and vile nature, other than the nuclear bomb.",1.0
"I could go on and on, but look, it is really very simple. It's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it.

"If you die and go to the underworld, it is supposed to be filled with the things you hate, right?  Well, my cursed underworld would be a small, stinky room, with N' Sync playing, a small TV with only 1 game.  And what would this game be?  If you didn't already know, I'll tell you.  Superman 64, in my opinion the worst game ever, would be playing.  The thing is, a blank screen is just as fun as has a more pleasent sound and plot than this game, electronic, err..... thing.  Stay away unless you are being paid to play it... and maybe not even then...",1.0

If you won't take my word that it [is bad], try renting it!

"I made the mistake of buying this game when it first came out and did not bother to rent it because I was a superman fan and the game looked fun on the package(of course). Not only were the graphics hidious, the music sounded like a funeral parlor, your tasks is to fly through circles and stop  a car from crashing in a very limited time. It's boring! But being the person I am, I quit playing and played it again several hours later hoping that maybe I didn't give a fair chance. Hah! I felt like I was being punished for murder or something. All I can say is THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN HISTORY! Don't even let your enemy borrow it ...but then again, let them borrow it!",1.0
"Sometimes, games are so bad that they're kinda funny and ok to play.  This is clearly not one of them.  I rented the game from a video store and after playing with it for a bit, I was pretty close to asking Titus Software Corp to give me back my four bucks, and the time of m life that I actually wasted on this truly horrid game.
Why was it so bad?  This question could best be answered with another question - Who at Titus thought that it would be cool for Superman to have the mission to fly through hula hoops??  Since when did the man of steel have THAT death defying task?! Many of the ""missions"" which are supposed to thwart Superman include finding floating keys and flying through through anti-gravity hula hoops.  The only usable super power is flight with other powers only acessable upon finding special power-up icons. (Did these guys ever read a superman comic?) The gameplay was slow and confusing, and the graphics might have been impressive if I was playing this on a Game Boy.
In my opinion, you can get a more exciting Superman game experience if you tied a red towel to your shirt and jumped off a building onto a bike without a seat.  This is by far the worst video game I've ever played in my entire life.",1.0
"This game was, without a doubt, the worst game that I have ever played. It make a complete mockery of superman, and did not meet up to it's expectations.

It would have been much better if you could interact with the enviornment more and if they just got rid of the rings.  Then maybe someone could have given it two satrs.",1.0
"What, you thought they were for the game? Get real... The arcade game was more fun... and all you did was walk/fly right and punch!!

See if you can find anyone who disagrees...

Ehh, changed my mind... I'll show the game's score... wouldn't want anyone to think I actually liked this thing...

"As I expected, this game has good reviews, but does FF7 deserve that praise? No.

It was my birthday, and I wanted a new console and a cool game to go with it. I remembered getting a Genesis with Sonic 1, and having a SNES felt wrong until I got Super Mario World.

I got my mom to get me a PS1 and FF7. All the kids were raging about it. And it was in 3D! Wow, just imagine FF6, but in 3D. Oh man.

Thus began my unfortunate exploration of the JRPG. (I hadn't played FF6 at this point, but I played Chrono Trigger.) The backgrounds looked nice. The music was ""epic"" and the sound was trash. A lot of the sound was trash. It sounds worse than a SNES game. And what's the deal with the Popeye-looking characters? But something was compelling about the game. I wanted to know what happened next.

The only reason I played games as a kid was to see what happened next. I only wanted a new weapon in Mega Man because it was cooler than the M-Buster. It was a fetish. Mastering a challenge to achieve fun was foreign to me.

The video game industry is an industry--it exists to make money. If a publisher puts out a game that makes money but isn't strictly a videogame, they WILL do it. What was Square's motivation when they developed this game? Tell a story? Let players express themselves through cunning materia strategies and complex boss fights and complex dungeons? Something else? I don't know.

Let's look at what we've got. The game lets you start easy by pitting you against 2 weak enemies. One sword strike will kill them, or you can throw lightning. I think they even give you some inventory items. You can safely see how the combat works. You get to name Cloud and Barrett anything you want. This makes the game personal, but I don't know anyone who did that. It's irrelevant because the bastard is still going to have his existential crisis and behave in ways that you might not choose.

Eventually, you have a boss fight that, thanks to mistranslation, tells you to ATTACK WHILE it's tail is UP. If you do this, the boss will hit a party member, causing you to do the battle the opposite of how they intended. You might even game over. After that, more dialog, and you get to make a choice with Aeris: ""You'd better get out of here"" or ""Nothing...hey, listen..."". This affects a cutscene WAY, WAY down the line from here. I never made the connection until recently.

The materia system lets you customize your spells. If you want a mage, you load him with spells, his HP decreases, and his MP increases. It's a good idea to change his ""row"", making him stand further away from the enemy, thus killing your melee damage, but protecting you from melee damage. The game doesn't handhold; it lets you figure out the finer points of the materia system. I liked how FF6 let your characters permanently learn spells, but FF7 are tied to materia. It's not a bad system, but considering the game is 60 hours long, you might master it before then and get bored.

For years, I've gone back and forth with myself about whether FF7 is good. I've concluded it's partly responsible for making games too casual. Despite that it's an RPG you don't get to make meaningful choices. You get to make very few choices about what Cloud does outside combat, and most of them don't really matter. If we're going to try elevating videogames, it would behoove JRPG fans to demand more choices so they can truly role-play their own ""anime hero"". I'd recommend giving players choices in story that let them end up a pathetic failure or butt of the joke in their own story. Fail states are important.

Of course that would take a master stroke in storytelling, something videogames aren't known for. Videogames are not literature. For every decent videogame story, there are 10 books as satisfying as eating a meal. Game stories are intentional experiences that happen a specific way. If they don't happen that way, then the designer has to account for that, or face an endless web of possibilities. Games are dumb at telling stories. Even games that give you plenty of dialog options are bogus because the end result is the same. At the end of FF7, there is only one outcome. This is a role-FORCING game.

I'm fine with games having cutscenes per se. If this game was combat, anime, combat, anime, combat anime without any illusions of choice, I'd be perfectly happy with that.

I can certainly hear them, because I've been listening to them for the past few years. I will admit, I was excited to play this game at first, seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008...but honestly, I wish I had never played it at all. Why? Well, stick around, sit back, shut up and read.

STORY: 2/10
Atrocious. Simply atrocious. You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud (default name, seeing as you have the option to name your main character), who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE. Why these groups and names have big, capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me, seeing as they don't stand for anything. Along the way, you'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you'll be doing in the current area you're in, get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters, and finally come to the climax of the game, facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes...but not because it's hard. It's not. I have so many problems with this game's story...okay, I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD. You get a total of 9 characters in your party, and guess what? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever! The only reason they exist is for party-filling, seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to...well, ANYTHING. Two of them you don't even technically have to get in your party to begin with! You can literally beat the entire game--all 13-17 hours of it--with the drooling retards you pick up along the way. The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story, and everywhere you turn, you can see something you can bitch about for hours. Party members included.

GAMEPLAY: 1/10
Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time. There's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game. It's the same boring, lazy turn-based system you're used to, except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable. The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched, and every time you use an attack, skill, or spell, you'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass. Oh, and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia...well, I certainly hope you stocked up on food, drinks, and toilet paper; you'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.

PRESENTATION: 0/10
What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.

SOUNDTRACK: 0/10
What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!

OVERALL RATING: 1/10
This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did. It's especially lucky that Amazon.com's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars. If it was a standard 1-10 rating, I'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10, seeing as I can't stand this absolute travesty of a video game. It's a downright abomination to the world, and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy, like myself. I'm glad I didn't play this game until years after it came out. If I had played it back then, I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time. You can't rate a game based on how well it sold, and you can't rate a game depending on the graphics. Why? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon. It's not worth a penny out of your pocket.",1.0

"I'd like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game. The main character, Cloud, is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games (like Kingdom Hearts) so I was really interested in trying it out. That, coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN, which quotes that FFVII is ""The RPG by which all others are to be measured, FFVII is a cinematic wonder"" had me thrilled to try this out. For some perspective, IGN quotes my favorite game of all time, Zelda Ocarina of Time, as ""IGN64 reviews the biggest game of the decade. Does Zelda 64 live up to the hype?"" I never owned a PS until the PS2 & PS3, so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for $9.99.

Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game, I'll provide a little bit about my gaming style/history before I go into the game review. I'm a huge RPG fan, and I like a variety of games in that style (turn-based, timer, real time strategy, action). I've played a few FF games (III, X, Tactics, Tactics II), and I liked them all, except for X, which I found to be a little too easy, albeit very pretty. I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games. I've been into video games since I was 5, and apart for a work-induced stint of abstinence in college, I still enjoy video games when time permits.

As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself, it must get better. It's just a slow start, surely the story picks up? I pushed on for a few hours, going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job. I'm glad I only spent $9.99 to try this game out, and not $100+.

Graphics:
I'm not sure what IGN is talking about, but these graphic are terrible. Yes, I know the game is from 1997, but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it's graphics have held up to the test of time much better. Although the PS and N64 (pre-graphics expansion) are supposed to be comparable, a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross (1999 PS). The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch. Also, since it was being released on the PS network, Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics (like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs. Maybe it would look better on an old TV? Who knows. The cut scenes have slightly better graphics, which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT's in game graphics.

Story:
I wasn't really impressed by it, although it it's an interesting concept. I've done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers won't have the story spoiled for them.

GOOD/Unique:
When you boil it down, you are basically fighting as an eco-terrorist, and that's an interesting concept.

BAD:
The character integration into the story is very poor. When you look at all the character's background stories, it doesn't make sense that they are all working together. If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECO-terrorists it would fit better. Aside from the fact that they are all eco-terrorists who live in the same beat down community, they really have nothing in common.

I did not like the characters I had been introduced to, before I quite playing. Cloud is incredibly angsty and self-centered in the beginning, and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant. His friendship with Tifa doesn't make much sense to me either. Tifa is a sweet person, and portrayed as kind-hearted, yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally. Barret, um, can we say racist? Barret, the only black person in the game, consistently beats his chest like a gorilla. Yes, let's make the black person look and act like a gorilla.

Gameplay:

Mediocre.

This is the most important part for some people, although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important. For me, if the story is bad, it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game. The game play here was average, it has a pretty typical timer set-up, nothing to write home about. I'm not sure if this game invented timer play, if so Kudos to Square Enix. The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions, so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play. Once I figured out the game play though (~1hr of game time, most of which is scenes) I quickly grew tired of this game.

Summary:
This game has average game play, terrible story, horrific graphics even for a late 90's game, and pretty pathetic characters. I played for 3-4 hours and then gave up on it. My free time is limited, and I don't waste time on games that aren't fun because ""they might get better."" Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour 4. All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game, and I'm quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites.

UPDATE:
Barrett - when Cloud is introduced to headquarters, Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing. However, his overall portrayal may not be that racist, as I only played for 4 hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game.

Despite the comments and emails I've gotten about this review, I still leave it as 1-star. Without the nostalgia goggles I didn't enjoy the story, the graphics, the gameplay, or the characters.",1.0
"The product I purchased was a copy of Final Fantasy 7 for the Play Station. The picture of the product shows a original release where the cover is black, the copy I received was a Greatest Hits version and no where in the description did it inform me I was ordering the Greatest Hits version. This seller was misleading in their sale. I would advise others to be hesitant and ask questions about what they are buying.",1.0
"This game's so boring it makes you doubt your intelligence, it also has the worst ending in the series.",1.0
"I am a huge RPG fan and have played all of the Final Fantasy games, and FFVII (7) is the worst. The graphics are TERRIBLE, the story is long and boring, and the music (aside from the battle theme) is nothing special. I know it is often considered to be the best FF, but I just cannot see why other than it being the first FF for Playstation and thus the first one most FF fans played. I suggest skipping this one and playing FFIX FFX and FFXII (9 10 and 12) first.",1.0
"This game is probably the worst Final Fantasy on the PSX. The graphics suck and the plot development is so slow.  I played it all the way through when I was a kid. I recently picked it up again and began to remember how aganizing the pain was from the first time. I got through the first disk then stopped playing and broke all three of the disks so I would never stumble on it again. The only reason that this game has such a cult following is because it was the first Final Fantasy on the PSX. There are much better Final Fantasy's out there Like 6, 8, 10, and tactics.
In my dorm building I asked all of the gamers what the worst Final Fantasy was and they all said 7. Trust me, if you play this game you will become emo just like Cloud.",1.0
"This is the worst Final Fantasy ever done. Why? Play every FF from 1 to 6, you will see a progression in the depht of the gameplay, the characters, the story lines. In FF5 you had the job system, in FF6, you had FOURTEEN characters to choose from and all of them with a deep personality, in FF6 you had to use eight and in the final dungeon TWELVE characters at the same time. When you buy this game, you get a ""main"" character with punky hair and who never says a word, you can only use *three* characters, the stroy line is so complex that nobody knows what the heck happens at the end. OK, the story is not really complex, it's just confusing and pointless, it happens that the game designers had to rewrite the story three times in order to make room for the polygonal graphics, and then include enough eyecandy for the Sony/Squre executives.

The end result is a dull game with no meat, no substance, no fun",1.0
"When I first bought my PS2, I got FF10, FF9, and FF7.  That was back in 2002.  FF10 & FF9 I liked. Good stories & loveable characters.  But FF7 was a drag.

Then I saw all the positive reviews (""best game ever""), so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004, to impress me.  But I still did not like it.  IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many ""dry"" sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise (example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress).  In some sections, literally hours pass by with no story... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo.

.

Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced.  A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks, so they are near-equal.  A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses (like real people-some are fighters; others are healers). Not so FF7:

- it's all magic... physical attacks are worthless (about 1/4 the damage)

- and the characters are completely interchangeable. You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl.  And then the next battle, completely flip it around, so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer.  And then flip it again!  No individuality. Each character is identical.  Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting... not realistic at all.

.

Also, the story, while good, is poorly executed.  It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet's ""health"" - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication.  He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4.  That's why so many gamers go, ""Huh? What just happened?""  It was a good story, but a lousy script.

Overall, FF7 is one of the weakest games in the FF series (inferior to the other PS1 game-FF9, super nintendo games FF4, FF5, FF6, even inferior to FF10.",1.0

"Dis game seems so holy to alot of you fan boys.  Its a very long and boring game.  the graphics are the worst, EVEN FOR AN OLD GAME!!!!! THESE GRAPHICS WERE NOT TOP NOTCH when they came out,  where do u get that idea????? I'd rather  play pokemon than this game.",1.0
"...when i should have given it like -5 stars?  this game sucks, doesnt matter if its old, i like old games too.  but this game is so boring and the graphics are bad, even for an old game, bleh!!!!",1.0
"Every single time a reviewer gives this ""holy"" game anything besides 5 stars, reviewers complain.  I mean anything under 5 stars.........anything.  The majority of the gripes is the lackluster graphics.  When a reviewer gives it 1 star based on graphics....*poof*......a 5 star reviewer magically appears and  writes a review bashing the 1 star reviewer.  One can not say anything bad about this game, i mean,, not one single thing, you can not even whisper or worse yet.. allow a criticizing thought of this game pass thru your head.  Almost to the extent as if it was the law or a decree from God himself.  We all HAVE to like,,er...wait...LOVE, that's it, WE ALL HAVE TO LOVE THIS GAME. We can not say the obvious,(the graphics really are bad, an early feeble attempt at ""3-D graphics""), we cannot find error in the story, we cannot question the death of Aerith(why couldn't Cloud have said:  ""Hey guys, don't worry, I'll use a Pheonix Down on her right away),etc.etc...etc.... oh..and we have to start off every review by stating ""THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER!""
  The graphics are cruddy.  They tried to mold this polygon 3-d stuff and guess what?...it did not work.  The translation seemd hurried.  There are so many errors in grammer that its actually funny.  The story is the same in most final fantasies, good guy with buddies has to overcome a great evil.  The controls are bad, one can get stuck in walls and worse, you can sometimes lose your character on the background.  The combination of the story and character personalities, made this game a very ""un-serious"" game.  Yes, even when Aerith died, want me to bring up the question again concering the phoenix down???? Why couldn't Cloud, Tifa, Barret,etc.. think of this in the game?????????  Overall a very unpolished final release of a game.
  ""We only want to see positive reviews here"", this is what some reviewer said.  Another said:  ""Who cares about the graphics?"".  If they made a perfect game, then it would only get positive reviews(in other words, this game is no where near to perfect).  That other one, about graphics...do I even have to......well, ok, why not.  I care about the graphics, 100% of gamers care about the graphics.  There are some unique games which really do not require outstanding graphics, Pong, pacman, etc.  But this is Final Fantasy, you expect the best for this series.  Of the post Nintendo final fantasy games, meaning from ff7 to ffxi, this comes to a close last place.  FFX-2 takes last place in my book.  I give final fantasy 7 one star.  1 star.",1.0
"This is, in my opinion, the worst Final Fantasy game ever. First of all, the plot does not develop at all throughout the game, & seems rather static until near the very end. And then even around the end of the game, where usually the story takes a huge turn for the worse through some sort of a shocking revelation (apparent throughout most of the FF series), this situation is just dumb, & the plan for resolution seems to be pulled out of nowhere at the end. As for the materia system, this system is [poo]& requires you to play through many redundant battles just to try to get some spells to use on the higher creatures. The push-button critical attack is also frustrating, taking some near hours to master a certain characters timing correctly. If you want a good FF game, go get FFVIII, or play through the Anthology series.",1.0
"dont get the analogy there, this is for video games btw.  This game has got to be the biggest letdown in graphics ever.  i can play nes games with no complaints about graphics whatsoever, but this game just bites.  the story is ment for kids too, which is not bad, but as an ""post-teen"" young adult, the story is a joke.",1.0

"a very slow and boring story line that basically goes nowhere.  with superslow loading times, this game is a drag.  the graphics are a big drawback of this game.  they aren't flat and easy to look at nor are they realistic and three dimensional.  they are a disaster, sorta combining a really early ""polygon"" type of rendering with a cartoony bubble faced ""protoype"" graphics. very raw and unfinished look.  VERY!!!  you can only use the cross to move, there is no analog function on this game.  cloud is a wuss, Cidd points that out alot in the game, and rightfully so.  Cid is DA MAN!!!!  the characters were sooo different from each other, sorta like they didn't take the time to make characters.  lets make a big black man, a red lion, a jumbo puff, a big t*tted girl, etc....The summons are ok, but some look lame, almost half of the summons loook very lame.  shiva looks stiff and empty.  titan was a lame summon.  odin looks like a hobbit with horns.  3 bahamuts, oh gosh, too many don't u think?  well, an overall bad ff title.",1.0
"I being a veteran of videogaming, have to say I'm very excited in the recent reviews bashing this game. Final Fantasy VII is a horrid RPG game today.
That being said, this game now well beyond its' years is still the worst RPG I have ever played. Close to being the worst game ever. By todays standards, the graphics are horrid.  Very ugly and every part of this game was a hackneyed look at something stupid. Your charachter goes from a centrally located city, to fortified town, to a beach resort, to an amusment park and so on and so on. At one point you end up in outerspace, ( i know, ""what the heck""???). There is to much to describe in a review, lets just say there is plenty of lame places to see.
The gameplay is rediculously stupid. The materia gems were a bad idea. Being able to fit elemental materia to weapons and armor allowed for great stupidity. Combo certain materia together and your charachter could attack from two to eight times in one turn(what a lame way to make the battles tooo easy). The junction system in FF 8 is way better than the materia system. Those who perfer 8 over 7, i congratualate u guys!!!
  The mini games are the worst ever for any FF. the amusment park has an arcade and rides????? A battle arena to compete for really lame prizes. You can bet on, race and breed chocobos????? The amount of things to do is a way to try to make up for the lack of story here. The sidequest are boring and will help your party if you complete them(very boring). One could easily get lost.
The story is not the greatest. You never really take it seriously.  one of your party members is killed 1/3 way in the game, how stupid, why cant i use a phoenix down, or cast full life?????????. The true enemy of this game is a fabio longhaired man with lame clothes. The corporate enemy is nothing more than sidetracking cannon fodder for you to level up with. I guarentee a sense of satisfaction when finally putting this game in the trash can. there is NO charachter development. Trying to make this story serious and funny at the same time, often leaves players wondering where the story is headed., or if there is indeed a story, was there one????? For the most part, ALOT of  complaints about the story.
  The musical score sucks. every other ff is done better. At no point in this game does the music fit the scenario the player is currently traveling.
This game got a lot of hype during its arrival. A catastrophic piece of not only gaming, but art. Every RPG made after FF7 is better. This game literally almost put square out of business. Those who had this game from the beginning already know that Final Fantasy VII is not only a stupid game, but arguably the PSX worst of all time. A milestone, period. MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!",1.0

"All right, listen up all you so-called video game ""experts"" and ""critics!"" Let me give you the lowdown on Final Fantasy VII.
For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen.
Other than that this game is tolerable considering today's standards. But they will never be able to compete with FF VII's soundtrack, it is beyond competition.

So i come to depend on reviews to an extent for some kind of assurance of quality and most importantly...enjoyment, especially if its an item im not too familiar with (i.e.:  final fantasy vii).  I played and got through ff8, ff9, and ff10 before i decided to buy this game.  Final fantasy 7 was supposed to be the, oh jeez, ""greatest game of all time.""  Ugh.  No its not.  All these 5 star reviews are sprinkled with slogans such as ""greatest game ever"", ""best game of all time"", ""the best rpg"", ""the best blah blah"", ""best blah blah...."" you get the picture don't you?  In another day another time, maybe it was the best. Maybe for that one year it was out before Final Fantasy 8 came out, it was the best.  The graphics in FF7 are bad, they are not simple nor are they realistic....they are stuck in a ""middle-ground"" of polygon disaster.  The story is not bad, just very expected and normal for the video game hero genre of an RPG.  Save the world with your friends, basically the same idea in all Final Fantasies, with exception to Final Fantasy 8, which took the idea of love and incorporated it into the whole story(in my opinion, was a cool idea).  Compare the Cinematic Graphics form ff7 to ff8, there is a big leap and improvement in 8.  And from ff8 to ff9, and of course ff9 to ffx.  The music, is well... video game music.  its enjoyable, haven't found a ff with out music i could live without except ffx-2, the music in that games sucks.  O.k.  in conclusion, yeah, Final Fantasy 7 can be your favorite game, but that in know way makes it the best....game...ever.  If final fantasy 6 was  first released on the playstation, everyone would be saying the same thing, best game ever.  if ff8 were the first ff to be released on the playstation, everyone would be saying its the best game ever.  oh, why am i giving it 1 star?

"i had so much bombing in this game.  basically cloud is a little boy who is looking for his dog Sniffles.  his friends help him but they kill aeris, clouds sister, when she tries to steal clouds nuts.  clouds likes nuts because he so nutty ^.^  well, when they find out that sefiroth want to start a night club, well, thats when the whole party begins.  my favortie part is when sephirtoh spits out his chocobo from his hair.  i also cried when bahamut zero drank the alka selter and exploded a turnip.  so many cookies are here too.

Materia, holy, meteor, limit breaks, and everything else that has never been done before makes ff7 the best rpg ever.

I have played every Final Fantasy game, and this is the only one that I actually just turned off in the middle after getting totally disgusted with all the characters.

It makes it worse that I was in Japan when this game first came out there, and so all I saw was the characters and FMVs everywhere, and I was really looking forward to the game. So disappointing. VIII, IX and X are ALL so much better.",1.0
"I have to admit, i like the newer final fantasies better, this one has very bad graphics and the story is for teens, not really a final fantasy for adults.

"If you're gonna start playing a Final fantasy game, start with 6 or skip to 8.  this game is so boring and bad cuz of the grpahix and the story.  Its very boring because its so outdated.  im playing final fantsy x-2 right now, play that game instead.",1.0
"I'm not sure as to why this game has been idolized so much... I can only assume that it is because of the fact that many people either have not played the previous Final Fantasy installments, or value cheap looking characters above solid, delightful gameplay and plot developement. I have played and beaten every single game in Square's flagship franchise, and there is only one FF game that was weaker than this one in terms of plot and character developement. It is Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, a game that all FF fans dread to remember.
Final Fantasy VII is not all bad. But the graphics are indeed very ugly, and the conversations that Cloud, the main character, has with himself are very stupid and sometimes almost dumbly insane. The remaining elements of Final Fantasy VII, however, are very pitiful. The script is so bad that it gives you the embarassed feeling you get when someone is giving an unprepared speech. Character developement is disgustingly poor save for Cloud's. Keep in mind, however, that the main character never even comes close to matching the incredible complexity of FFVIII's Squall. Supporting characters, such as Tifa and Aeris, serve the same purpose that Jar-Jar fulfilled in Episode I.
No one will ever find out WHY Sephiroth is such a jerk. No one will ever find out WHY he wants to be the ""bad guy"", why he hates Cloud, or why he defies every humane issue. And I will never know WHY the FFVII team suddenly decided that the background of a character is vital to making the player want to follow along. Sephiroth is not the only cast member lacking backbone. EVERY character suffers from an insane amount of neglect in terms of personality. The would-be romance between our hero and the flower girl had potential, but was taken nowhere.
The ""plot twist"" involving the memory-wiping effect of Shinra energy is so jarred and so random that it appears that several people who never saw each other or talked to each other wrote different parts of the story for this game. The characters have no significance in the plot developement whatsoever; their sole purpose is to aid the ""hero"" in battle. Yet halfway through the game, we discover that these characters that have had no place in the story are responsible for stealing the memories of an entire village. It is rather obvious that this was merely a half-hearted attempt to somehow connect the cast in a forgotten past.
Compare this script to the witty, hip attitude of Final Fantasy VI and the rich, heart-throbbing, hauntingly beautiful tale of Final Fantasy V. Upon comparison, it becomes clear that the story of Final Fantasy VII is a random, childish process with unsuccessful attempts to convey deep, thoughtful ideas.
The music in Final Fantasy VII can be described in three words: Repetitive, dull, and uninspiring. Looking back on the game, you will discover that there is NO main theme for Final Fantasy VII. There is no theme for Cloud. There are no main themes for any of the main characters. There is no theme. There are also many different pieces of music written for the different settings and situations that are encountered throughout the game. But when you think to yourself: ""Tifa,"" you hear the flower theme. When you think: ""Barret,"" you hear the A-team theme. Most of the central characters are met in the city, so the short, circus-like track set on a constant loop is the musical representation of FFVII's entire cast.
Think of the full, detailed scores of Final Fantasy VI  and VIII, dedicated to the characters and their emotions.  The music of Final Fantasy VI has yet to be matched, and the feeble pieces in FFVII could not even come close. To sum it up, the music of Final Fantasy VII is a major drop from the previous and latter installments.
These are only two of the countless fatal flaws that cripple Square's delivery of Final Fantasy VII, and I could go on with so many others. I, however, only have a thousand words to spare, and if I went into all the imperfections of this horrible excuse for an RPG, I suppose the world itself could not hold the books that would be written.",1.0
As one reviewer pointed out there are a few pearls of wisdom (the science of a good gravy) in this otherwise wordy and fairly patronizing book. I was looking for a book to explain the small nuances of how to improve a particular recipe or tweak an ingredient to bring out its fullest potential but I what I found was pretty much a garbled and condescending chemistry lesson -- and not a very good one at that.,1.0
"If you like RPG's, this game is a must have. It's like reading a novel you can't put down. There are times you laugh, get mad, and even cry!

"Well, honestly ive played all the final fantasy games from #1 thru FFX-2 so far.  I haven't played ALL the final fantasy games ever made.  Just the ones in the main series, you know, with the roman numerals after them.  What I can say is some people are so oversensative about games, man.....why??? First of all some of these reviews are funny as heck.  I don't have a problem with them ""venting"" out this way.  I didn't make the game, im not losing money from the reveiws.  Secondly, I didn't play these games in sequence.  I did play Final Fantasy 8 and 9 before I played 7.  I was let down.  I think its such an AVERAGE final fantasy game.  Why is Sephirtoth so great????? He wasn't ""evil"" for me, maybe ""annoyingly bad"" at best.  I think one reviewer got it right, let me quote him/her:  """""""" Look at most of the 5 star reviews, they basically just defend the game rather than reviewing it. So you cant really trust those reviews. Secondly, this game DID NOT sell more games than final fantasy 8. final fantasy viii easily outsold this game. ok, the graphics do really suck. the story is very typical about a one person out to save the world plot. This game has a character that basically dies off 30% into the game, so u waste all this time trying to build this character up and then you can no longer use her. the ending is very short and lame. this game really let me down, i was expecting so much more from it since i had heard of how ""great"" it was. I think most of the people out there cant devote 50+ hours to an outdated rpg. i mean, there is a big jump in visual graphics from FF7 to FF8, that is very obvious. this isn't a level by level game, like castlevania or supermario brothers where one can enjoy a quick romp thru a nostalgic game, this is a 50+ HOUR GAME!!! who wants to devote that much time to such an outdated and graphically handicapped game???? so stop whining about the 1 star reviews, and just admit gamers are disullusioned with this game. Enough said."""""" welll, about the sales, im not sure, but seriously get a life and stop whining about these reviews!!!!",1.0
"I'm sure many FF fans reviewing the game here at Amazon.com have noticed the tremedous trend following many 5-star reviews. The spotlight reviews above, along with numerous others, are extensive reviews covering the aspects of the game and recommending this Playstation Greatest Hit. Despite the lack of effort they put in these expressive and thoughtful reviews, several indignant anti-FFV fanatics have mindlessly disapproved nearly every single 99-star review or anything that even remotely recommends this game. You know what I mean. Where it asks ""Was this review helpful?"" Look at the numbers: ""1 out of 2 people have found this [5-star] review helpful""; ""5 out of 7 people found this [other 5-star review] helpful.""
It is so cool and  obvious that this is the work of some ff7 fanboys irked by the crap and crap of this game. Indeed, hype is the only thing that sold this game. That goes for books and movies too. Notice that several 87-star are the ""most helpful"" and notice that a handful of them are recommending Xbox over VII. Ok, now go to school and take a good look its the reviews. Notice something else? All the reviewers that praise ME receive a lot of ""helpful feedback."" Did you see the trashy feedback the 34-star reviewers got? How about the ones that said it was overrated or does not live up to its predecessors? It's a shame, really.
That trend has subsided recently, but it is no less a problem. Both the five-star and single-star reviewers have written useless two sentence reviews. However, some of disapproving reviews are absolutely truthfull. One reviewer said ""cloud looked like mc hammer and he wished that cloud could dance like him."", oh my gosh, this is so true i thought to myself.  In certain consecutive 1-star reviews, there is utterly no nuance in the language between them that you could guess that either i'm reviewing the game twice or I planned this out with a friend. Instant gratification. And I'll admit this is my 100th review for the game. I just can't stand this pain in my head and shoulders cuz im a fanboy and think cloud is super cute.
FFVII is my  least favorite RPG, but I still have sense of objectivity. If you have something to say then say it. If you've already played the game and despise it, then you should review it.

"FFVII is a role playing game where your decisions during the game will poop the overall outcome of the game. You are in control of a lame-o named Cloud, an ex member of the famed Soldier from Shinra Inc. Cloud, along with a group of dorks fighters by the name of DORKS, try to free the city of Midgar from the evil clutches of the president of Shinra Inc. Along the way Cloud befriends a young flower girl, a scientific experiment specimen, a fortune teller, an assasin, a ninja, and an ex pilot who help him in freeing Midgar. But there is an even deeper evil at work here as Cloud and his friends discover that the greatest Soldier in the world, Sephiroth, plans to destroy the entire world. Now with the help of his newfound comrades, Cloud must face his teenage past, and face his teenage idol in a climatic battle for the freedom of the world and the destruction of evil.
Final Fantasy VII introduces a lame time based system for battle sequences. Instead of taking turns hitting each other, the time based system makes it so that you have to pee a specific amount of time to attack again. The world map lets you travel anywhere and do almost anything.

"The first time I turned this game on, I played for hours upon hours. FF7 is, in my opinion, the worst RPG, if not game, of all time. The graphics are lame and the storyline is even worse. Although the music is totally annoying, it's too bad. I loathed FF7 and put 48 hours into it all to make my daddy pay. The story is about a guy named Cloud Strife who used to work for a band of porcupine raisers called LOSERS. He teams up with a group of lame-ohs called THE LOSERETTES to stop Shinra, the evil chocobo who is destroying the Earth for personal benefit, and Sephiroth, Cloud's childhood ""partner"". In this game, not everyone is what they seam and Cloud is a loser.
The Gameplay is too damn easy to learn.  The fighting is bad.  they did away with the old job system (if you like the js I recommend FF34, FF33, or FF454). The final boss is easy  and his Super Nova attack takes 3 porcupines away from you.

Cloud the hero, is very lame.  the cast of characters is alright.  This game will bore u to death, seriously will.  In my opinion, Final Fantasy VIII is the best final fantasy on Playstation 1.",1.0
"I REALLY gave this game a chance, but it failed to live up to all the talk i heard.  I finished it and couldn't help but feel bored.  the ending (is)so bad, from beginning to end, i felt like it was like playing a really boring game.  I like final fantasy 8 and 10 better.",1.0
"this game is not too good. basically it was made to make final fantasy 8 better.  this game has alot of quirks that make playing it very boring and long.  u get stuck in walls sometimes and the translation is bad.  sometimes ur character blends in into the background.  just so many errors in this game.  the gameplay is slow.  the only thing cool is that its very cheap, but i wouldnt recommend it.  try final fantasy 8 instead.",1.0

"Hands down this is the worst RPG I have EVER played.  If only .. gave the option to give it no stars...  I have almost every RPG out there (50+) and this one is by far the worst.  The storyline was dumb and uninspired, the characters were laughable (and not in a good way), and the main boss could be killed with one hit.  I like RPG's where I can connect with the characters and a fun story line.  This had neither.  The story line was really what turned me off of this game, trust me, it's not that I did not understand the story line cuz I did, it's just that the storyline was bad and predictible.  Yes  I said predictible.  I saw every event comming.  The characters could of been the saving grace but no...they fell miles short as well.  To top it all off...I won't give away the ending but I will tell you it was the worst ending I have ever seen.  My best friend that LOVES the game, for so odd reason, even hated the ending.  ...",1.0

"I bought NBA Showtime with the purchase of my Dreamcast hoping for some real basketball. I was sure disappointed. After playing it twice I put it away for good. The game is stupid. NBA Showtime has the worst gameplay ever. The computer can jump 50 feet in the air to make a block then swish a full-court shot. The graphics are terrible. The players' muscles' are bigger than their heads and they look very unrealistic.
This game blows! It's just like NFL QB Club except for basketball, an NBA 2KX wannabe!
Do not buy this game.  Midway sure know's how to [mess] games up!",1.0
"After buying my Dreamcast used with alot of games, I just noticed that this is the last game I tried out, and the first game that I put away. The gameplay is the shallowest ever.

The colors in this game are very bad and dark. the entire game looks like an N64 game.

I hope that this review was helpful to you.",1.0
"Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for ""die hard fighting fans"" is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that ""turtling up"" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.
My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this ""demon sword wielding"" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway?
If the game had a better plot (one that involved some thought) then it would be a classic, but as it stands...no.",1.0

"If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT. I beat the game as I got it once I discovered ""the formula""...
I'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundown
Pros
1) Characters are unique and fun with personality, i.e. personal story, ending etc (missing from PS2)
2) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive
3) The moves and effects are radical (King Capcom shines here)
4) Fast action
5) Cool Japanese voices
Cons
1) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game!!
2) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula!!
Overall
Overall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game. The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed. Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast, read my review!",1.0
"I got this game because I had just gotten a PSX. I should've waited a couple more months to get SmackDown. Attitude DOES have good graphics, but the problem with it is that the button pushing is really bad. It's like Mortal Kombat. In order to due a move, you have to punch in several variations of control-pad buttons, and then the other buttons. It's really bad. I couldn't even get the guys over the ropes in Royal Rumble mode! That's why I gave this a 2 star rating. I want a game that you can just sit back and play! Not a game where you have to remember which buttons to push in order to do a move on the other guy!
The only thing I did like in this game is when a wrestler came down, you got to see him actually walk down the ""ramp"" (Actually, there WAS no ramp, there were actually stairs!) and then to the ring where they did their stuff.
All in all, don't get this game. Actually, I don't think you can anyways. But if you ever find it, and think of buying it, DON'T!! Look to your left (or right, depending on where the other WWF games are) and get Smackdown!",1.0

"Terrible, horrible, very bad. May be the worst game I ever played! I despise it and it's just no fun at all.",1.0
"when I first got this game I thought it would be pretty descent, but to my surprise the game was lacking control, camera view, and difficulty
  The controls for this game are absolutely pitiful its like playing asteroids for the first time, when you hold up the character goes where hes facing which most of the time is not up. So when you first play this you will die, die and die untill you get the chance to get used to the horrible controls. Most of the time there are obsticles that you have to get around and you cant get around them so you die
  The camera view is way off it looks as if the camera is stuck on a building because if you move away from it, it doesn't follow, instead you have to go to the next street to find out there's more bad camera views. Some of the streets are very long and it can get to the pint when the character is to small to see.
  O.K. I like difficulty in games nut this is ridiculous, its probably because of the bad control and camera view, but also the fact that the zombies will not die. Once they are knocked down they get right back up and you cant run past them for a couple of reasons:
  1. that would be boring
  2. Cant run fast

I do not recommend this game.",1.0
"Don't buy this game, if you are curious rent it or play a friend's. Moving around is like moving in quicksand, you are constantly being attacked from all directions. If it was in a first- person setup, it might make for a challenging& fun game. Instead you get a overhead view& constantly you are attacked from the rear& loose much health while slowy turing around.

"I bought this game after reading the reviews and now I wish I hadn't. When you first turn it on, you think it might be fun because of the colorful graphics. But the levels are tedious and surprisingly difficult. It's too easy to fall off the cliff, and your life meter is tiny, so you have to start the game over a lot. The continue starts you over at the very beginning of a world, and so then when I fall off the cliff a couple of times I have to start all over again, and on and on it goes. It's very frustrating for me and my wife and my son. We all hate it. The stuff in the levels is very repetitive with the same stupid props in every level like the lazer beam that kills me every time. Plus the PacMan guy is kind of hard to control. Don't get it, there are a lot better games than this out there like Spyro, all the Crash Bandicoot games, and Ape Escape.",1.0
"Being a South Park fan, I was looking forward to this title.  However, it is SO repetitive and annoying...the turkey level alone goes on FOREVER.  Friends of mine have had the same reaction.  It's a first-person shooter (or should we say first-person snowballer) that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys.  Yeah, I know, according to the packaging, that the game evolves into some sort of space/zombie creature thing, and you're supposed to save the town, but I never got that far due to the overlong turkey-shooting level...when I saw the average 4-star rating, I knew I had to respond.  Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tie-in, but this 34-year-old was bored and disappointed in this title.",1.0

The original resident evil game was ground breaking and innovative. Unfortuanateley when something is well made and original there is always a danger of sequels designed to make money on past glories. Sure the game is smoother than the original but the jerky character movement in the first game was part of the appeal.

I bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system. It's graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play. But the chances are that it will now be a dying system. With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow. While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the DC.  There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease. A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become.  Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line. The local video stores around me have dropped Dc. Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale. The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games.  Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind.  Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry. The current price is very very good. But it is consol taking it's last breaths.  Was the PSX2 heaps better. I don't think so. Not from what I saw. I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours. But it's day is gone. The future is the PSX2. A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar console's.  Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the future.,1.0
"Let's sum up what is great about Dreamcast:  Sensational graphics (equal to PS2), great sound, good controller design and an excellent, although not outstanding, software line up.
Now, what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low ------ Sega Corporation!!!
If you haven't heard the announcement yet, Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console.  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low.  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn.  Once the Saturn production was stopped, only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.
When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX (the same programming API as Windows for the PC) I was very excited, because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast.  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come (Urban Chaos, Rainbow Six) were bad.
Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies.  I believe that Sega owes it's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform.  My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years.  My Dreamcast lasted six months.  Goodbye Sega purchases forever.",1.0
"The game disc was completely scratch and my PS was not able to read it. Therefore, I was unable to play the game and wasted $5 on a game I wasn't able to play with",1.0
Sega does not even deserve a one star.  The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog.  Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo.  Sega has decided to give up to the competition.  Finally.  They will now only make games.  I am happy for that.  I am a Nintendo Fan.  Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo.  Dreamcast starting in February will drop ....  At the end of the year goodbye Sega.  Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete.  But Nintendo Rules,1.0
"i got this game and imediatly regreted it. i did not like it at ALL. the graphics were worse than mine (i have a graphics art business even though im only 11) and the music was, well, not very good. way to many baddies and although i didn't get anywhere in the hour i tried to play it, i really think you should get something else. if you like arcades and ridiculus games that make you die, start over, die start over typ of thing sure go ahead and get it. but if your a person like a big Zelda fan (like me) get something else, youd be useing your money better. those people who gave it 5 stars, they have their own oppinion, and if they like it they like it, im glad they found something they like to play. i however would urge you to consider what im saying.",1.0
"Well we all now think that the DreamCast has the best game, it's the best there is in the market, and it beats PS2. Well that may be true. Even though I don't have DC, but looking at the records, did to the Sega fans I doubt DreamCast would become the best out in the market. If you remember to the older versions of Sega, what happened to their games? Yup all gone, they don't send anymore to the US evem before the DC came out, most people may have even forgot there was a Sega company. For those people who has/had Sega Saturn would know, it came out with many title of games and the next two years what happened to those games, well they stopped manufacturing them. Also what happend to the Sega Genesis console games??? Well same thing happened, they just stopped shipments. I dunno to much about history but so far I know one thing, history always repeats but in a different way, this time Sega's ""best console"" will just as well do the same thing like what it did in the past. They just stopped making the games. Well personally if your going to buy any console, I think that you should buy PS2 or wait for the X-Box, but not the next Ninetendo product (Dolphin) because they just don't make good games. Although I must admit Dreamcast does have good graphics. I also think that people who say the graphics of DC is better then PS2, I think they're just to weak to admit the two systems's graphics has no difference.",1.0

"I purchased GameShark for my daughter who loves to play Pokemon, but this product was a big dissapointment.  At first the GameShark didn't work and when it did it erased her game.  The GameShark was supposed to help her further her game but instead she had to start over right from the beginning.  It is hardly ever touched now at all and I regret spending good money on it.  I would not recommend purchasing a Game Shark at all.",1.0
I just bought my gameshark enhancer yesterday & I tried to make the codes work but they don't. Then I tried to upgarde my gameshark and it froze on me & now it doesn't do anything but show the stupid gameboy part at the very beggining.,1.0
"If you are planning to buy this do not!! Trust me I got one a week ago and it freezes your game,erases your saved game,and is not built well at all (it bends because of cheap materials and may crack)!! It doesn't work with all pokemon games and it comes with a code book for the pokemon games!! It freezes all Mario games such as Mario Golf!! Some games don't freeze. They totally erase your game!! Sometimes nothing happens. It just starts your game and the code doesn't work!! I returned it the next day. After I wasted my time reading the directions (which are confusing and they make typos that make a big difference such as how to turn it on)and trying to get it to work!! If you don't believe me then fine waste your money on this product!!",1.0

"I absolutely love this game and it's one of the best computer games that I've ever played.

 However this alteration of the game is a joke! The graphics of the cities is appalling especially when the invention advance comes along. Thye just look like mere tents!

 The greatest mistake however was the whole ""Unified Theory, why the Universe Exists at all"" part! I don't know about you but I had the same problem where this thing popped up, and ending my game even I've only founded like two or three cities thousands of game years B.C.!!! What is that all about?!

 This is still a fun game for it's intents and purposes but the way they handled this though is a travesty to the original Civ 2 game.",1.0

The dang game shark would not work. I was really excited when I bought this because it was my first game shark and I always wanted one as a kid. When I came I ran and got my n64 and got GoldenEye 007 and command and conquer 64 and plunged in the game.e shark but I would not work it kept reading the number 8 and the letter A or 7 and then D. It was so weird and it has not worked sense. My main concerns are that I wasted $15.00 for no reason. From what i've read online its supposed to count down from 5 - 1 and then the screen appears. Nothing ever happened. It just won't work.,1.0

when i recieved the gameshark pro. i tried putting it in my n64. i tried several different methods to see if i could get it to work. all ive tried failed. so with a friends help i tried to get it sent back for a replacement. id like a replacement please. until then ive been ripped off.,1.0
"I bought the gameshark for the N64 because I wanted to do all that crazy stuff like levitating and having infinite everything. That part is great about the Gameshark, but using it on Glover destroyed all the save data and I was unable to save the game after using the Gameshark on it. I also used it on Donkey Kong 64, where the cheats did not even work, and even worse, destroyed my file (which I was almost done with). I had to play the game all over again which upset me a lot. It did work for some other games and did not destroy the game data, but after those two incidents, I wasn't going to use it again. I disliked the Gameshark so much that I just threw it out rather than giving it to someone, so their games don't become corrupt.

If you don't care about ruining your files and just want to have fun with the cool cheats, this is for you. If you spent over 30 hours playing a game and do not want to have it lost, don't get this.",1.0
"Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time, I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.

The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break.  The first stupid thing it does is in its use, you put the Gameshark into the slot, then stick the game up on top of it.  As with many cartridge game systems, it seems you need to wiggle it about, and position it just right just for it to work.  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided, because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way, like it's supposed to.

Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.

The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke---both VHS's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT!  If you still remember how VHS's work, this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT!  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS, packaged it with the Gameshark, sent it back for a refund, and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else!

Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working.",1.0
"I never got it to work but the item was fairly inexpensive, so I didn't bother returning it.",1.0
"It's 2007, 2 consoles have come out, but if anyone is still thinking about buying this, DO NOT. It will be lots of fun and excitement... for 1-2 weeks. Mine lasted 13 days. I was editing a code for super mario 64, and it suddenly crashed. No buildup, no warning, it just crashed. It showed a screen sort of like the one when you unplug your cable service, except the static was tinted green. It will then say it has no code space when you start it up again, and it's completely corrupted. I didn't missuse a key code, this is sm64, not zelda or anything. Interact went bankrupt, so no customer service. I suppose you could spend like, 5.35 to have fun for 14 days or less, but it's not worth it to me.",1.0
Do not buy this i just bought a n64 and a gameshark and a few games also. When i got home I tried to use it but it wouldnt work because you have to have a game that does not require a key code and it didn't say anywhere before i got home with it about this. Then when i went to play a game after turning on the gameshark without a game my nintendo would not work anymore. So if you are thinking about buying this product you may want to think about whether or not its really worth it.,1.0

"I don't own a Dreamcast or any other Sega product (as if I want one) but i've tried them at stores friends house etc... And I have to say that the controller is the worst. First of all i'ts horrible for racing games when a tight turn, you have to look at the controller to see where the button is. The same thing for action games etc... In other words don't buy it.

Now even if i did find it (which i think this one is) i still need one that will work with my computer operating system. So hope i was of some help to someone on this.

This happens repeatedly and in  various degrees at startup.  I don't know if it is my computer as I've done  everything I can to remedy the situation -- without success, but there's  obviously some kind of glitch in the game and I think people need to be  aware of that before they buy it. It may be among the best games out there,  but for some of us, that will make no difference if you can't play it.",1.0

"This game is horrible.  As a huge Star Wars fan, I was hoping for a fun, strategy game to play using the Star Wars universe.
Yet, not even the force could bring this game back to the light side.  The gameplay is aweful, graphics are worthless, and really there is no reason to play the game.
If you want a good strategy game, try Starcraft, Age of Empires 2, or Civilization 3.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!",1.0
"I hate this game so much.
I was warned that the game is difficult to learn. I read the whole 170 page manual before installing it.  I read the 40 page tutorial a second time before playing.  After four hours of trying  to get the game to work I gave up.  I have an engineering degree from MIT  ('93), so I'm not stupid.
The interface was the worst I have ever seen  for any non-Unix software.  Nothing makes sense and C3PO stands there and  insults you the whole time without giving any help.
As it turns out, I  had bad luck the first time I went through the tutorial.  I had started the  game in a situation in which I could do nothing.  Except that I didn't know  that since I had never played before.
Imagine a game of chess with a  twist.  Instead of all 16 pieces, you flip a coin to see if you get any  particular piece--heads you get the piece, tails you don't.  Sound  interesting?  Now imagine that you don't get your king.  Now what?  That's  what the game is like.  Actually, it's worse.  Imagine that you are told  what the pieces do in a book 170 pages long, but that you can't really see  them do anything.  You can't even see the board.  You have to provide 100  detailed instructions about how to move each piece and the instructions  don't make any sense.  For instance, I had a mineral mine that could go  through space, but I couldn't make spaceships. You don't know why you  lost.
LucasArts should never have associated with this garbage.  I  thought that I would never buy another LucasArts game again without playing  it first.  But then I bought Rebel Alliance.  Now I know I'll never buy  another LucasArts game without playing it first.
I tried to give the game  away, but my friend gave it back after one day.  He said it was the worst  game ever. It took him 40 minutes to figure out how to quit (he goes to  Harvard). I tried another friend, but he gave it back (Ph. D. Penn State  Industrial Engineering). I tried another friend (Psych major) who gave it  to somebody else who finally threw it away, but kept the action figure.  I  guess that last guy never played the game because after being insulted for  four hours, I don't know how anybody can like C3PO ever again.
I hate  this game so much.  I regret ever getting it.  In fact, I couldn't play  other LucasArts games that I love for 3 months until I got over the  loathing toward that company. I wish I could give it negative stars. I have  yet to meet somebody (flesh and blood) who likes the game.  My only wish  now is that I had burned the game slowly and watched the CD melt.  This  game is a case study in horrible design and horrible interface.  I wish I  could say that I learned something positive from the experience, so, well,  nevermind.",1.0
"Apparently the way to win this game is to completely disobey your mission objectives.  For instance in the last mission I played (before uninstalling it and throwing it away) I was supposed to pick up a container, protect my  mothership by fending off the attacking tie fighters and fly to a  checkpoint to meet the rebellion.  So I picked up the container and started  killing off tie fighters.  I got them all.  I was killing them as fast as  they were replaced.  Then I got slammed with a dozen missles from all sides  and lost the mission.  I never got notification to go to the next  checkpoint.  The game has a help function after you lose a mission that  gives tips on how to win the mission the next time.  The tip?  Don't  protect the mothership.  The checkpoint won't appear until the mothership  is destroyed.  Besides, if you attack the tie-fighters, then your container  will get destroyed and you won't be able to finish the mission.  That might  be okay, except that the game doesn't tell you that you can't complete the  mission.  Once I just sat there for 10 minutes waiting for something to  happen.  That was boring. After four hours of finding out that I was  supposed to ignore mission objectives and do very little I uninstalled the  game and threw it away.  My only regret is that now I wonder what would  have happened if I had destroyed the mothership myself. This was a definite  waste of money and time.  After my experience with Rebellion, I am now  certain that I will never buy another LucasArts game without playing it  first.",1.0
"The USB Gravis Gamepad Pro stops working after a while (Windows 2000 claims I have a gamepad pro plugged in... except that the buttons don't work).  There doesn't seem to be a solution, except for a half-baked one which is to reboot the computer when it happens, so I don't recommend this product.  I replaced the Gravis with a USB Belkin Nostromo N45, which works like a champ.  I also have a Logitech Wingman Action, which also works very well.",1.0

"This controller is, hands-down, worthless.  It has the following problems:
1. Your hands WILL ache.  I have used old NES, Genesis, PS1 and PS2 controllers and - gasp - even an N64 controller.  This thing is worse.  My hands hurt after a few hours and get cramped.  Very bad.
2. Horrific directional pad.  The pad here is vastly inferior to any of the pads mentioned above.  It seems to me that even after calibrating it in many games, the control pad is just so loose that sometimes you end up pressing directions you don't want to.  that's not too bad in free-movement, immersive environments where one misstep is usually not too bad - but forget about doing your dragon punch in Street Fighter, or your precision high-speed maneuvers in Puzzle Fighter.
3. No analog sticks.  Speaks for itself.
There are way, WAY better controllers out there.  If you want something to play console games on an emulator, particularly, avoid this like the plague and get either a PS2 DualShock 2 controller with a USB adapter (I'm still trying to find a good one) or pick out just about anything else.
I'd say this thing was useful as a paperweight, but its so light it falls off of my desk every 5 minutes due to the weight of the cord.  AWFUL.",1.0
"I'm slow to give a 1-star rating, but this certainly takes it.  First, the grip is hard.  The grip it thin and small extends vertically from the controller.

"I bought 3 of these controllers (1 blue, 1 black, 1 green.)  The top decal that says the brand name broke off first on all of them but it was no problem, i just glued it back on.  About a week later the ""Z"" button jammed and despite numerous attempts to fix it i couldn't.
On the plus side my friend has has a grey one for about 3 years now and it still works.  The downside is it is ugly as hell.  The plusses are that they are cheap compared to the Nintendo brand controller, don't get this save up the 10+ dollars and the Nintendo brand will last you longer without any problems, mine hasen't.",1.0

Even when u turn it off with no disk, all of the icons for the save games were blank, and my RPG files all said that the data was damaged. This happened after a month.

This memory card is a pipe dream. You can not use it for very long before it gets corrupted and fails. Do not rely on this piece of junk. My advice is to not buy this thing.

When I saw this game on sale when it just came out I thought it would be a blast but I was wrong.

"My friend has this game and I have Roller Coaster Tycoon. She told me how great it was and I tried it out.
There is one advantage I can think of for getting the SIM theme park, which is where you can ride the rides and walk around your park. As cool as it sounds, it still isn't all that great. Sometimes on rollercoasters you get stuck facing backwards at the other passengers. For bouncy rides the scenery just bounces up and down (not too exciting). You can't ride every ride that I kow of, which disappointed me.
The graphics are O.K. Compared to Roller Coaster Tycoon, however they look like something that would be in a game for preschoolers.
Like Roller Coaster Tycoon, there are a few different scenarios (actually RCT has more...) and you can not play them all without earning them (aka, beat a scenario and another one is available).
Overall, I was really disappointed with this game. It is good for younger players, but if you are older and want a more complex and worth-while game, get Roller Coaster Tycoon.",1.0
"First I would like to say that I got it for playstation and it really was not good. RollerCoaster Tycoon was so much better and I hope that none of you buy it because it was THE WORST game ever played by me ..., I would go out and buy a totally different game and I hope I convinced you too. All that [nonsense]about riding your rides, it sucks, Don't buy this game, especially if you already have rollercoaster tycoon because it will disapoint you BIG time!! Don't take your money and waste it, buy a GOOD game!!!!
EXTREMELY DISAPOINTING",1.0
"This game [is bad], to be quite blatient. It is extreamly hard to get your funds going up, for starters, and there are many other thing wrong with it. When you are suposedly losing money, your actualy gaing money, but some times you can go rupt anyways. The rides are a joke, and the interactive ""let-u-ride-it"", isn't interactive. Over all, the only reason I gave it a single star is that when you finaly start making money, you feel so good that you actualy defied what the degsiners seemingly wanted you to do, loose! This game is a definate disapointmen from Sim, and I wouldnt pay  so for it.",1.0
"I honestly don't think they could have made this game any worse if they tried!  It is the most boring game in the world, theres nothing to do, all the worlds are the same, basically it sucks.  If you want to get a theme park making game get Roller Coaster Tycoon, its really fun.  If you buy this you'll just be wasting money, because trust me, you will never play it again!!!!",1.0
"Being a Roller Coaster Tycoon fan, I bought this expecting a similar experience, but with more up to date graphics.  The graphics are indeed extremely good, but everything else is pretty pathetic.  The only advantage that this game has over Roller Coaster Tycoon is the ability to ride the rides you build.  You are ""trapped"" in a certain theme whether you like it or not, therefore customizations are limited.  Another really frustrating aspect is the fact that you cannot ""zoom out"" to get an entire overhead view of the park.  It also is a bit too ""cartoonish"" for my tastes.  I wish that I would have read the Amazon reviews before buying this game!  Do not buy this game!",1.0
"EA did not do a thorough job when designing this sim.  The game itself does not compare to RTC or RTC's Extension packs.  Unfortunately, the realism of the Sim did not compare to the quality and design of Hasboro Interactive's Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Electronic Arts promises first person realism with this game, but does not deliver.  The interface and design structure of a theme park is not enhanced by this simulation game.  I would agree with another review in stating that this sim is merely a gaudy N64 scaled game.",1.0
This game is stupid. It allways freezes my coputer and i have to turn off the computer and start it up again. I wouldnt recomend this game. You allways run out of money unless you don't build a lot of rides but if you don't build a lot of rides you don't get any customers. i would rate it lower then 1 star if i could.,1.0
"I bought this game because I heard you could ride the rides and walk through your park, and I really liked RCT so I though this would be way better than it. I was wrong. This game is probably the worst game from EA.  First of all, the game is to busy and complicated, meaning that they ask  you you to do so many little things, for example, they ask you  to make  sure there are security guards there, make sure there are janitors at the  bathroom, make sure there there are entertainers amusing people in the  lines, and make sure there are inventors or scientists to create rides and  there is so many more things I cant remember.  Second of all there is this  little black ball thing in the corner that is REALLY annoying and it keeps  telling you to do this, do that, make sure of this, etc. You simply can not  have fun and enjoy your self with this game because of all the junk you  have to do to make sure your park is ""perfect"". Even ZDTV's  Gamespot TV agrees with my thoughts.
To make a long story short, I  recomend Hasbro Interactive's Roller Coaster Tycoon and Expansion Pack. It  is much more enjoyable and you can simply have more fun with RCT.",1.0
"Ok,
I'm a HUGE fan of Sim-stuff ... I can't get over how clever they are, how real they play out, how absolutely consuming they can be.
This product is not one of them.
It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game. You are limited to two island scenarios to begin, and they are in  themes like Dinosaur, and Space Ship ... and they are VERY tiny -- not much  to work with.  Creative-wise, you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme -- IE: your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaur's stomache as one of the rides. *shudder*
I think the game is  ideal for children 10 and under. It's fun and quirky enough to entertain  them, but it's not what you'd typically expect, as an avid adult player,  from a Sim game.
Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if you're an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software (but even that gets a bit dull after  a while -- it's easy to win and repetitive).
Or try The Sims, it's quite  entertaining, and very well put together.",1.0

Thats fine, I needed a reason to replace that drive. 20 minuets later and a replacement drive now installed, the drive found the disk! But when I clicked on it, it said the drive isn't located. This was odd to me. I tested a few other games and it read them fine. Put the game back in and I got the same result. So I grabbed my Surface Pro and an external disk drive and test it on there. Sure enough, it says my disk is corrupted. Wonderful. So I come back to amazon to return it and lo-and-behold, its not eligible for return. Lovely.

"This card recently died on me.  The only reason someone would want a card this big is to store a huge number of save backups, especially if you're a compulsive saver like I am. Unfortunately, I only used about a third of the memory locations on this card before it stopped working.  While I can still access any memory on the page that it is on, I can't access any of the other pages.  I strongly suggest you find a more stable memory card, and consider a Dex Drive if you still want to keep a ton of save games.",1.0

"I too am an avid RPG player, and have this card with entire saved games from Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and the first disc of IX.  I saved in the 15th slot of page 9 on this card, which is in slot 1, and then saved to a standard card in slot two so I could turn my PSX off and back on to switch to page 10 and start a new page.  Upon rebooting the PSX, I go through the clumsy sequence to change pages to the 10th page, and it flashes for a second and then comes back with a flashing E and goes back to page 9.  I've tried everything I can think of, but all my other saved games are gone and there's no way to move forward.  Save your money if you plan on keeping your saved games.  This card is junk, and I will never buy another product from Interact.  As I've found out tonight searching the net, it appears their products are known to malfunction and in some cases even destroy Playstations (i.e. their Virtual Memory System).
It's only a matter of time before this card eats your saved games and is worthless.  I've talked to other gamers and they've had the same problem with this card.  Until tonight, I stood by this memory card, but wouldn't suggest this one to anyone now.  Years worth of game data that I archived to this one card are now all gone.",1.0
"Simply put, stay far, FAR away from this one.  I am an avid RPG player, and mistakenly thought that I had found the Holy Grail of memory cards at the price of a beggar's goblet.  I found however, that after a month of heavy gameplay and a plethora of game saves that I had in actuality purchased a black hole.  I had taken great care to follow the instructions in depth and to the letter in hopes that would prevent such a tragedy.  No such luck.  I lost abesolutely everything, and as other RPG players can tell you, loosing a game save and having to start over is VERY disappointing, not to mention frustrating.  Now imagine loosing all game saves, from many various games.  Take my advice, this card is simply not worth it.  As I've come to find out, if it isn't at least endorsed by Sony, you might as well toss it.",1.0
"The InterAct (or the Pelican) just aren't worth the money, in my opinion. My kids continue to lose saved games, and, with the Pelican, it broke after only a week of use.

"The only reason this game gets one star instead of two is because of the hype.  I hate hype, especially when it pushes a product so undeserving as this.  I realize many people, ESPECIALLY people new to computers and this genre of game, like Half-Life.  I also know that most of the experienced gamers and computer nerds I know don't like this game.  Could there be something to this?
First of all, the A.I. in this game is no better than Quake II or almost any other FPS.  It has been praised by many magazines, including PC Gamer.  But the fact is, the A.I. is still A.I. and therefore is still dumb.  And I have a feeling it is not going to get smarter for years.
Second, the atmosphere in Half-Life is too cheerful.  Now, I'm not saying it's happy, but when you are playing it, you just get that feeling that these aliens don't really hate you.  Most of this is do to the brightness of the game, but the rest is just due to the monsters themselves.  Id Software had this aspect of the game nailed down perfectly in Quake I, which is now what I compare all single player games to.
Anyway, I have said what I think, and no doubt I will return to this site in a few days to find 2 of 73 people found this review to be helpful.  If you want to buy into the hype, get Half-Life.  If not, save your money, because a quality single player FPS will be released... eventually.",1.0

None of the pinball tables are really that great. The 1931 pinball table, ""Baffle Ball"", is certainly baffleing to us, with no real guide as to how to play it, you only can guess on what to do, and the best way to go about scoreing points. Game critics tend to say that the best feature about Pinball Arcade is the sound, and I'll have to agree with them on that, but thats not saying much considering the ball physics of Pinball Arcade are frustrating and unrealistic, and the designs of the tables are unimaginative. All in all, the tables are either too easy, or because of the lack of realism, very difficult. It almost put me to sleep the first few times I played it. The ball drifting around the table makes me sleepy just thinking about it. Buy Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey, it's much much better.

"This review is only to point out that the Gold edition of Age of Empires lacks the CDDA music tracks which were present in the original releases of Age of Empires and Rise of Rome. Presumably to cut costs (since compact discs are sooo expensive ya know) the data for both games was crammed onto one disc, leaving insufficient space for the CD music.

The games still have music obviously, but it is in the limited MIDI format which will sound different on various hardware configurations, not to mention lacking the capability to reproduce many of the specialized sounds heard in the CD tracks.

AoE Gold therefore is a technically inferior product to the original game and expansion, despite what the packaging would have you believe (it's GOLD so it must be better, right?!). This applies to any ""Collector's Edition"" (cheap cash-in edition) compilations in which it is included as well.

"For me Strategy is so so so important when it comes to an RTS this games lacks in that field for starters this games has one aspect in war: its Attrition based first hit first win type of a game

let me explain, say i have a terran marine attack the enemy who also has a terran marine if by chance they shoot first when i attack i lose

for me the chance to use guerilla warfare is vital when i played the game against friends online(who were better at than game than me) they would just build a huge army and attack me i used hit and run, diversion, and deception the result, i would lose(from my understanding a large standing army does poorly against hit and run but for some reason this game doesn't give a bonus for using tactics, not even conventional warfare makes sense)

the game itself isn't to bad for being so old so i give it credit for that, but for me who is into strategy and actually using my brains to outsmart my foe this game lacks tremendously
but like i said its not to bad for an old game

its just the strategy lacks especially that in order to be good you have to be so good and not even use the mouse to play you use hot-keys(its not playing its button mashing now)

I hope this helps so be forewarned that you may think you can use modern tactics no its more like blitzkrieg tactics(attacks with tanks than have troops behind)
also the defense in this game sucks if AI attacks you with a crap load of troops and you have defense you cant stop them unless(you spend your resources all on defenses then you cant even fight back)

JUST DONT BUY IT, I BELIEVE ITS 2009 SO FORGET ABOUT IT THERES BETTER GAMES NOW",1.0
"This game is terrible, the graphics stink, the gameplay is very shallow AT BEST, no wonder people are selling it for so cheap, it's worth just as much as a couple of rolls of toilet paper, atleast with toilet paper u can wipe your a$$ with it, this game is actually so horribly awful I might actually use it like toilet paper.

To give you some understanding of how boring and crappy, (oh I cant emphasize how god awful the graphics are) I would say that I would rather eat some candy canes, and I F-ing hate CANDY!!!",1.0
"Do not even think about getting this game, if you are, than first of all look at the date i wrote this, now look at most of the dates of the good ratings, 90% of them are VERY old, the game play is horrible, i am not sure what blizzard was thinking when they made this, no heroes?!?! no main characters to level or anything good? just plain old boring repetition throughout the whole game, if amazon would let me i would make my rating negative, i think i would of had more fun burning the money it cost me.

Game play: how low will it let me?
replay value: good luck getting through the first time without dieing boredom....
graphics: is that a unit or the ground?
overall value: absolutely none

In conclusion, go buy pong, trust me, you'll have a much better time, heck u would have a better time burning your money than buying this piece a crud game.

"I purchased this game after having read the several positive rewiews others had written for ""Gabriel Knight 3."" I'm not sure if the majority of reviewers are fans of the books themselves and therefore are fans of the game. (And possibly, for those reviewers who have read the books, it may have given them information needed to determine character direction.) I found myself aimlessly searching for items, with no hint of an idea to what the goals were in order to complete one time slot, yes... the game is ""leveled"" in time slots, and begin another. Hours of aggrivating gameplay, searching over and over the same locations, musing on whom or what I had forgotten in order to progress. Well, after hours of prolonged irritation, I finally logged on to a GK3 walkthrough site and learned that I HAD already collected all the items required, and HAD already spoken or eavesdropped to all the characters needed. In fact there seems to be an order to which things must be done. (With absolutely no indication, during gameplay, as to what order that may be.) The walkthrough insisted I needed to return to a certain location to progress to the next level. Ironically this ""location"" is exactly where I had last saved the game. So, knowing this, I took an enjoyable walk around the same room for awhile, like I had several times before, when the game finally decided that I have had enough BS and loaded the next level. (A huge step, I had just completed the first time slot.)
  Besides the aggrivating gameplay there are many more negative perks to look foreward too:
  -Annoying main character. (He sounds like a southerner hopped up on a mixture of an aphrodisiac and crack.) If there were a way to kill him I would have.
  -Annoying supporting characters.
  -Horrible graphics. (Outdated.)
  -Storyline? What storyline? (Didn't read the book.)
  This game will take it's place, without being completed, among my other ""worth while"" games and collect dust.",1.0
"I gave up in chapter one. I was completely unable to do anything except eventually get Gabriel out of doors where I promply got turned around and lost.  I never made it any further due to sheer frustration.
I loved the first 2 games.  The first was cartoony but really interesting and logical.  The second had a really swoony Gabriel,a great plot, beautiful scenery and camera work.  The only problem there was the werewolf scene near the end.  The game froze up every time I used the talisman and I could not finish.
Never the less, I looked forward to the 3rd part.  I am not coordianated enough to be anything but dizzy in this format.  However,  I suspect that for those who can use the 3d format that they will love the game.  Just not for us oldfashioned non-tech people.",1.0
"I bought the GK2 and was blown away. Felt as if I knew the characters and cheered for them. In this I didn't like them at all.  Snappy, sarcastic, horrendous voice jobs.

I tried over and over to correct this problem.  I  ended up shooting several bullet holes in the CD.  Basicly, the game just  has to many glitches and is very poorly made.  So, please do not waste your  money on this game.  There are much better ones out there.",1.0
"Although the Dog-Fights are really fun, it tends to get a little boring when you've beaten the game 10 times on maximum difficulty. The single missions keep it alive, but have the same overall flaw. Quick combat tends  to be the same way because there is no randomness. 1-9 planes will come at  you and as soon as you kill all of those, 1-9 more will come at you again.  Also, although the planes look like they have there own shape, they are  really blocks to the computer, which means you may hit things which you  really didn't. However for a game created in 1997 it's pretty good.
  P.S. it is really cool when you see a plane go down in a fire ball.",1.0

Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow( on a  Pentium II 400, voodoo3, 96mb RAM). I have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up. And whats up by only controlling 12 units at  a time? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screen. Starcraft's ingame graphics aren't that good, FMV qualty is terrible  and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and  few options. Westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster. All in all, i say the command and conquer series is better - go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C&C game - SC isn't worth  your time or money.",1.0

"This has to be one of the worst expansion pack's to one of the greatest games of all time. How do I know, because neither Blizzard or Sierra ever mention the expansion pack on their website--a means to distance themselves away from it.

For example the graphics on the hive level for some of the monsters are absolutely terrible. You have small toad/pumpkin like creatures that attack you WTF? Large Spiders? It doesn't fit the Gothic essence of the game. Not to mention Diablo can again be easily killed, so easy that you don't have to do it, just summon a golem-the same can be said about Nal'krul. The new spells are not attractive either, you have spells that help you search (umm okay), you have spells that you can summon to take you back to the entrance (how is that suppose to help), and such spells as ""beserk"" only work for the barbarian, which can only found by hacking the command file.

Secondly lester the farmer is a joke...beyond retarded...In order to get to the Cow Quest, or unlock the barbarian (looks exactly like the warrior) you have to hack the command file. And by updating from 1.00 to 1.01 you loose the ability to play multi-player. And I don't understand the point in creating the monk--his best skill is hand to hand combat with the staff....a degenerate version of the Sorcerer.

And the promise of great items, such the King's Swords and the Godly plates are extremely hard to find. Unfortunately to get them you have to use a trainer. I can't believe that the expansion pack now runs for almost $50, what a rip! If I had a thousand I'd sell it all for free.",1.0

I'll focus on The Beast Within: a clumsy little figure  trying to move around, having to take each turn at least three times before  succeeding, talking like he's been on some very potent tranquillizers  (remember? ""It's meeee, Gabriel Kniiiight""), making stupid,  boring comments with every step he takes. As for the storyline, I couldn't  get the grip of his endlessly going back and forth between the few places  available to him in each level. It wasn't my kind of logic. I'll give some  pros as well: I liked his female counterpart a lot better than I did the  man himself, and I thought the Munchen city map was very handy and  original. Of course, these are all details and highly subjective.  Nonetheless, I have given my warning. Time can be better spent.",1.0

"Although I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this product, I was still expecting something that wasn't horrendous and terrible to use. The D-pad was the worst part of this controller. It was able to be pressed down, pressing all of the directions at the same time. This makes many games overly difficult to play. The other buttons are slightly better. They are responsive, however, they feel overly cheep and you don't get feedback from the controller to let you know that you pressed it. My other controller makes a slight click when pressed. This may seem like a very small complaint, however, while playing fighting games this click is very much needed. Overall, I wish I hadn't ordered this controller and should never be bought.

"First off, this is not the same Super Pad controller as one I bought several years ago. This item does not have the Super Pad name anywhere on it. The buttons seem fine and I actually kind of like the gritty (not smooth) plastic body, but the D-pad is horrible. Setting my thumb on it for the first time I pressed the D-pad in, effectively pressing up, down, left and right all at the same time. Trying to move at an angle gives mixed results in game play. It looks like moonwalking while playing NBA Jam. If you are very delicate, you may be able to use this controller to play games that do not require diagonal movement. If you want to be able to focus on game play instead of finessing your controller, buy something else. I will be buying a different off-brand controller to try. If that doesn't work, I'll have to fork out some cash for a used Nintendo brand controller. I can't believe anyone would put out a product that doesn't work from day one. I understand if it isn't very durable and wears out quickly but this is ridiculous.
I should note that my item was Sold by: WILLIAM C ALLEN. aka Hitgaming.
I expect that you get a different item depending on which seller you buy from. This would explain why some folks are giving such positive reviews.",1.0
"First off, this product is not what was advertised. I've purchased and used Superpads before, which made a decent replacement for the official Nintendo version. This, however, is an inferior product (Tomee brand) to what was already an inferior 3rd party product. The directional pad is overly stiff, which could greatly limit its use for any games requiring you to roll the d-pad. The button feel is not consistent at all, with one feeling soft and slightly sticky, and others feeling more firm and crisp. The plastic case itself seems poorly machined with a rough surface. Even though I only spent $5 on this, I feel that it was a waste of money.",1.0
The picture for this item was incredibly deceiving. It indicates a genuine super nintendo controller. Complete with purple buttons and such. The item I received was a knock off brand with green red and yellow buttons. The directional pad is not responsive at all. I plug it into my console and using the directional pad sometimes doesn't work or takes 2 seconds for the button's press to register in all the games I own.,1.0

So if your Terran or  Protoss and your coming into rush them, you cant possibly win because the  lurkers cant be detected unless you have a observer or something that can  see burrowed or cloaked units.

"I'm not deterred by the fact that this game is so old now no one is likely to read my review. I feel like I have to put my two cents in. I am a huge fan of the Quest for Glory series and couldn't wait to get my hands on ""Dragon Fire."" I wish now that I had just quit at QFG4. When I began playing Dragon Fire I wondered if I had mistakenly ordered the wrong game, as there was nothing remotely similar to the first four. I am a firm believer in the old saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Sierra took everything I loved about QFG and changed it into an aloof, tedious, and downright disheartening game. The characters with whom you interact are mind-numbingly dull and inpersonal, the constant-running clock was distracting, the battle/travelling interface was unfamiliar. The one thing I was looking forward to is choosing a wife at the end of the game. I must have missed a conversation or item I was supposed to have, because the game ended after the dragon battle with no mention of a wife. I had to look at a walkthrough to see what I was missing. That's another thing--in the first QFG games the play may have been a bit more linear, but I found myself having to cheat several times on this game. How else would I know to bring an urn (I forget the Greek name) to Hydra island to collect goo for my hot-air balloon? Once you leave the island there is no going back, and if you don't have the goo you find out later on in the game that you can't proceed. Unless there is something else I missed. I wish I were a computer programmer so I could make my own version. To put it bluntly, this game sucks.",1.0
"I hate all of you non-gamer's that rated this a good game.  I was looking for a game that was comparable to MOO2 and this is what you guys suggested!?  I don't want to dog the game too much but I found nothing good or exciting about this game.  You have a grid with stupid icons that roam about with what seems to be no direction and they do not seem to follow your commands at all. These icons in the shape of astronauts, dune buggies, and cargo carriers roam about searching a small area over and over finding absolutely nothing and never registering how many turns they are using and they all seem to get in each others way.  You keep building more and they seem to go wherever they want and when you don't move them the interface asks if you are sure...as if they actually accomplish anything when they roam about except for running into some exploding fungus that seems to arbitrarily pop up whenever and where-ever.  This game lacks direction and purpose.  The colony base you are working out of is too complicated for what it is trying to accomplish.  Also, you never get to see what you are building in a way that is practical.  There is no practical organization thus it is understood why the designers of this game had to put pop-ups over and over and everywhere to explain what you should do and why you are doing it.  You build a colony truck because it tells you to and you move it to a square on the grid of your choice and it tells you you shouldn't or cannot, and you build it to serve and accomplish what?  To build more?  This game just doesn't do it for me.  I guess I'm spoiled by Master of Orion II and shame on me for thinking there is a game out there that could complete with such a masterpiece.  Thumbs down for me...I'll try something else, don't waste your money.",1.0

"Awful! A real disapointment. This game is confusing and boring much like civilization 2. The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was. I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then. I was sooo dissapointed. It takes forever to play, the battles are cheesy and a waste of time. If you are considering buying this game, I reccomend you try it before you buy it. Belive me it's not even worth $5. I've always been dissapointed with Sid Meier's games. So I think I'll stop trying them. If your considering this game, try Imperium Galactica 2. It's awsome. No comparison. I hope you found this reveiw helpful.",1.0

"This time EA Sports really screwed it up... That once thrilling, fun game has become an annoying, outstandingly boring piece of junk. Why do they change stuff no one complained about?  We can no longer choose in what  stadium to play, transfers have become a hard-to-solve puzzle -- due to a  ridiculous money limit --, we can't choose more than 8 teams in a league or  merely one in a season... They completely messed up the Brazilian league,  reducing it to 7 teams and making the players' names unrecognizable.  And  how was the game ""improved""? They created the season mode -- be  careful: if you get down to 2nd division, there's no 2nd division to play  in! Oh, they added the MLS, even though no one had asked for it. And they  added classical teams, which created some funny situations: you can easily  beat Holland '74 playing for Al-Nasr in the professional mode; however, in  the World class mode, you can't even beat Al-Nasr, even if you are a '74  Dutch! I've been buying the series since '97, and all that could be asked  for was maybe the Argentine league. Now we have the pathetic leagues from  Israel, Turkey, but we didn't get Argentina -- and lost Portugal. A shame!",1.0
"There are so many flaws with this game it's funny. The only good thing is the the animation on the players' faces and the animated crowd.  Now for the flaws: 1) The Commentary.  There is only one word to describe it:  horrible.  What happened to John Motson?  ""Phil and Judy"" sound  like morons.  It seems like they only know one player's name on each team.  In '99, Motson named at least a few players on each team.  Phil and Judy do  not sound the least bit realistic in their ""commentary.""  Also,  not every team is introduced by ""Randy"" at the beginning of each  game.  It's obvious that they were too stupid or prejudiced to say  ""Saudi Arabia, Al Wasl, Al Nasr, Al Ahly,"" etc.  2) MLS.  Merely  adding the MLS shows what level that EA has sunk to.  And since they added  the MLS, they might as well have allowed you to play in an MLS season.  Pathetic. 3) The faces on almost every black player look distorted.  When I  played this game for the first time, I used Manchester United.  The faces  on Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke looked horrible.  They didn't even look  realistic at all.  When I began to play the game more, I realized that  almost every black player's face was like this.  Another biased feature of  FIFA 2000.  4) The shielding does not work.  They can still tackle the  ball away from you! 5) There are no sideline players visible during the  gameplay.  The sidelines are completely empty! 6) Difficulty levels.  Once  you play the game for a while, you will realize that the  ""Professional"" level is extremely easy, while in ""World  Class,"" it is almost impossible to retain control of the ball and stop  the opposition from scoring.  7) The season mode is ridiculous.  Andy Cole  was averaging a hat trick a game when I played as Manchester.  The Bottom  Line: EA Sports has some serious, serious work to do if 01 doesn't end up a  pile of garbage like 00.",1.0
"Who does EA Sports think it is fooling? This game is worthy of an add-on to Fifa 99 at best.
I found myself getting extremely bored of this game.
There is, as of yet, no internet support, poor AI, un-real simulation,  and mediocre team management. I advise all to wait till the next one comes  out- I'm sure after their poor sales EA will finally take the hint and  actually produce a NEW game- not some tired version of Fifa 99.",1.0
"I knew I was in trouble when I saw Eddie Pope on the cover of the box instead of a proper footballer like Beckham, Yorke, or Rivaldo.  Who buys FIFA 2000 to play mediocre MLS teams, or hear American announcers who sound  as though they've just gotten out of bed. Where is their enthuisiasm and  their spirit. What about the idea that the announcers broadcasting the game  should know the names of the players? They act as though every match they  were broadcasting were as boring as the typical Wimbledon vs. Derby County  fixture. I liked the game better when EA didn't try to Americanize it.  Basically all of the negative reviews that have been posted so far are on  target.",1.0
"I have tried  installing this game on Windows XP after I was told by the seller of this product that it would be compatible. On the first attempt, the install screen did show up and went through the tests, but then said it could not read a file in the program.

"Being a devotee of the Civ/CivII series from day one I eagerly awaited the next installment of this series.  However I was sorely disappointed when the product arrived.  The game is overly long, the units are beautifully  rendered but don't always provide benefit to the player (I'm thinking of  the less than useful Legion unit here) and there is never a sense of  satisfaction when the game is finished.  I have let this title gather dust  and gone back to the classic Civ II while waiting for Civ III.",1.0
"Luckily I did not buy this game myself -- I merely tested it on a friend's machine.  Civ II is one of the most replayable games in computer history; this is one of the least, assuming you can even get through a single game.  The designers looked at Civ II and stuck to the old motto of America  ""MORE IS BETTER!""  So, they added more units, more governments,  more improvements, more wonders, more screens, more subscreens, more tasks,  more....
This game gets bogged down incredibly quickly.  Some of the  units are fantastically powered (like the Slaver); some are not even worth  buying (pity the poor Spy and Leviathan).  Trying to take out an opponent  is next to impossible.  Trying to create a viable empire is next to  impossible. What you end up with is a VERY long game to no particular  purpose, other then mere repetitions of the previous turns.  History has  become dull...
Do not bother with this game.
This is NOT Civilization.",1.0
"This game is a VERY VERY poor follow on in the Civilization genre.  All they did was make the game more turns (and therefore more tech adv).  They added a number of sub rosa attacks.  User Interface was tough to get used  to for moving units.  (I often ended up clicking a unit into a long move  series...)  Finally, the end game graphics stunk...
In fairness, their  trade model is better, as well as the tile improvements model (no more  enigneers/settlers).  They kept capitalization and infrastructure (from Civ  II).  Very good is the ability to save a production queue to use  later.
Go to the Alpha Centauri page now and buy that instead.",1.0
"This game is just CivII with a new coat of paint.  The game is boring, the AI of the computer is weak.  I don't recomend it to anyone.  The tech support on the web didn'y solve any of my install problems that I had.  When I called ech support I got the ""Is your computer pluged in?""  line of questions that got me no where.",1.0
"If you've played Civlization or Civlization II, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  It is an unworthy successor and almost unrecognizable as a Civ game.  While the graphics may be better (and slower), the entirely new format for  managing cities and battles is annoying.  For example, one new feature is  grouping multiple units into armies.  This grouping seems cool at first but  quickly becomes cumbersome.  Perhaps if I'd never played another  Civilization before, I would appreciate A Call To Arms more.  However, as  it stands, Call To Arms is inferior.
SUGGESTED ALTERNATE:  ""Civilization II:  Test of Time"" remains faithful to other Civ  games, has improved graphics and many new features.  Among them:  internet  play, multi-player, science-fiction and fantasy Civ games as well as an  Original Extended Version.  The Extended version requires you to not only  conquer Earth, but also Alpha Centauri as well, using new, futuristic  weapons.  It's unbelievably fun (even better than previous Civ  installments).  It succeeds where Call To Arms fails:  it improves upon the  Civ legacy.  It's even cheaper than Call To Arms!  If you want a new Civ,  get that.",1.0
"Ack, puh!
That describes my view of the game. The graphics are nice, and there are some features not in previous versions of Civilization that were also cool, but after paying. . . for the game, I have still never finished a game.
It takes too long, it is too complex in some areas, and units/technologies become out-dated too quickly.

"This time, I have to say, ""I wish I would have listened to the cridics."" This game was totally overrated by the pros. I expected a fun game, with lots of action. But, I found it was hard for me to interact with the game because of the (not so good) control concept. Example: when using the look key ""L"", as soon as you release the ""D"" butten, the view springs back to the direction your facing. Which can seem like a ""Tug of War"" match (against the computer) when your trying to zero in on something you're not directly facing.
And I'm sorry, but the characters are dorky looking and that really has alot to do with taking the game serious. It has a strong plot and you've gotta be this goofy looking guy who can't even jump.
If it had controls like the ""Tomb Raider"" games and a plot more like the ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" games, or mabye even ""Double Dragon"", I'd have given it 4-stars.",1.0

Problem
Does not load and play.
Solution
Activision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its Dreamcast title Blue Stinger. The manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores, but will result in start-up failure on certain Dreamcast systems.
If you experience this problem, we encourage you to call 1-888-402-8951 and The Blue Stinger Hotline will send you a new disc free of charge. You will be asked to return the faulty copy of Blue Stinger directly to the fulfillment house. A prepaid, self-addressed mailer will be provided for their convenience.
Activision is dedicated to promptly delivering replacement discs to affected consumers. We would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience, but are confident that once this problem is corrected, you will have an outstanding gaming experience with Blue Stinger and the Dreamcast hardware.
So, I just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem, or will have this problem in the future. So far I have only got their answering machine. Let's see if they are still supporting this title and call me back:o)

UPDATE:  Talked to someone from Activision.  He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there:o)  Guess it's been awhile since it was out.  Anyway, they replaced it as promised.  But, the games really [stinks]!!!  Don't bother.  It's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up, so I don't remember what it was that I didn't like about the game.

"Oh,if only I had read some of these reviews before buying this game and wasting $44.00. I actually purchased a new computer with tons of memory to run this game and I still wasen't satisfied with the game's performance. Yes the graphics are great, but the purpose of the simulation (the dropping of bombs on a target) is impossible. In many cases the key commands simply don't work and the instruction manual is grossly inadequate. For example: During the bomb run, in order to adjust the Norden bombsight the keyboard command ""shift+K"" is to be pressed. Unfortunately the command has no effect and the player after flying all accross Europe ends up dropping his bombs in a cornfield. The absence of accuracy means the player can never hit the target or advance in the game. Another manuver involving the bombsight refers to the joystick, yet there is no instruction given as to calibrating or energizing the joystick. I will never again buy software without checking reviews first.",1.0

"Well I received this title over the weekend, and still have not been able to get it off the  ground.
This is what I am having problems with and have encountered getting technical  support (a nightmare!!).
Game Problems:
1. Going to 'instant action' from the main game menu, I am presented with a CTD (Crash To Desktop), which means the game crashes, and your back at your desktop.
2. In The game, you need to review crew status, mission briefings ,etc. well so far I can not view these, do to they don't appear while in the game.
Applied the latest patch (v1.06) to correct allot of the bugs and CTD, and still have the above problems.

* Web Sites mentioned, do not work - Either receive a blank page, 404 Not Found, or Virtual Directory: Access denied error.
* Phone Support - They have changed their number already from the one in the manual. Called the new number, and was thrown into a loop from a dysfunctional automated phone system. And then finally was told I was in a 60 minute call waiting queue.
* E-Mail support - Received an auto response saying their e-mail address is no longer valid. I was then pointed to a new web site which pointed me back to the original Hasbro Interactive Dysfunctional web site.

My version was also laden with bugs and I found it to be highly unstable, despite my 900mhz processor, ample memory, and video card.
Anyone who has experienced the highly realistic flight dynamics of the MS Flight Sim family, Fly!, or any of the Jane's programs will find the characteristics of this B-17 overly simplified, unrewarding, and childlike.
Buy MS Combat Flight Sim 2 and download one of the many fine handpainted B-17 add-ons available as freeware out there.  Better still, if you can't shake the urge to the fly a B-17, put down your computer and pick up some Steven Ambrose -- the images he paints are 1,000 times better than Microprose.

However, had some problems installing Metro; I had to copy a physx.dll (spelling?) from my Nvidia folder to the Metro and blah blah blah.  It also hinked up my screen resolution, so I had to fix that.  (If it sounds like I know what I'm doing, I really don't.)  I also ended up having to restart the computer a couple of times.

After that, I noticed a shortcut named ""Fallout 2"" on the desktop.  At first I thought it was the installer file, which downloaded to the desktop.  But when I clicked it -- well, it started Fallout 2.  Without the making-it-unplayable rainbow pixels.  I started a game, and IT PLAYS FINE!  However, as for the commands, I very quickly realized that I now need to read the manual for more than entertainment; I need to learn how to play this game.  I have not done that yet, so I can't offer an opinion about the game itself, but I did want to correct my original review ASAP.  (I can say that the graphics aren't up to my 1920x1080 screen resolution, but this is a guy who isn't going to give up on Diablo II until every character has kicked his or her way all the way to the top.)

Fellow baby boomers will remember the great Gilda Radner's great character Emily Litella on the original Saturday Night Live.  She was this crazy lady who would go on a rant about some perceived social injustice until she was informed that she had completely misunderstood the premise of her rant.  At which point she would pause while it sank in, and then say, ""Oh."" (Another pause) ""Never mind.""  So, that's how I feel about my original review.

Here's the rub:  How did I do it?  How did I get the XP game to run on my Win 7 machine?  I have no freaking idea.

I decided to keep the one-star review just because I did not want to confuse things any more, and also to bring attention to the Win 7 issue, whatever it is.  Now it's back to the FO2 Manual, and to find out whether it's anywhere near as great as those 5-star folks say it is.

********************************
(Original review):

It's not as though Amazon misled me on this -- right at the top of the screen it says ""Windows XP.""  I'm running an 18-month old HP with Intel i7 @ 2.80GHz, 9GB RAM, Win 7 SP1, and ATI Radeon HD 4850, and Direct X 11.  Not quite state of the art, but not shabby either. (And a great HD monitor!) Oddly enough, some older games run great -- I still can run Diablo 2 and Doom 3, among others -- but Half-Life and some other newer XP games are unplayable.

So I had some trepidation about buying this, but the rave reviews made me take a chance.  Busto!  It did install, but when I try to run it the dreaded rainbow pixel curse makes it unwatchable.  I tried all the compatability settings (it tells me it's already running in compatability mode) and screen configurations, then I went online and got the patches, but no change.  I toyed with the idea of installing Direct X 9, but it's not worth possibly wrecking a $2,000 computer to play a $5 game.

If there was any money to be made by making this game playable in Win 7 I suppose someone would have done it by now. I just glanced at the game manual, and it looks like fun (the manual, that is; I have no idea about the game).  Sort of like the Zombie Survival Guide, and it even has recipes.  So it's not a total loss.

Well, I've blown five bucks on worse things.

(By the way, I went to the Microsoft site that tells you what games and other software are compatible with Win 7.  It doesn't mention Fallout 2, but it does say that Fallout 3 is not compatible -- but Fallout: New Vegas is compatible.)",1.0
I love the Fallout series and have played all the games. I got an itch to play Fallout 2 again so I bought and downloaded it from here. It dose not work on my computer and after hours of trying to fix it had to finally give up. It needs Directx 9.0c and The current version of Directx 11 will not run it and I tryed many things to make the game work even running it in Dosbox but to no avail. my suggestion is to buy the game at your own risk.,1.0

"This is, without a doubt, one of the WORST games I've ever had the displeasure of playing in my 20+ years of avid gaming. I'm sure it would be good for children that don't know any better, but seriously folks, this is awful. Movie franchise games have always had a bad reputation, and this doesn't help. Clunky, awkward controls and camera, blocky graphics, horrible story, unimaginative and confusing level design, and dull gameplay sink this game. I know that most people will read this review as being too harsh or analytic for a children's game, but heed my words: this game is awful. Even when taken as a purely children's-oriented game, it's awful. Too confusing for children (what 5-6 year old is going to understand ""active and passive camera""? A great franchise like Toy Story deserves better than this. I realize that this game was made about a decade ago (give or take a couple years), but still. It goes beyond dated.

Third, combat is awkward and  horriblly frustrating, not to mention NO fun.

"I bought this version of Scrabble for my PlayStation2 thinking it would be at least half as good as the one I own for the PC. Boy was I surprised. This is the worst version of Scrabble I've ever played. First of all, you cannot see the whole scrabble board. Also, the controls are very awkward and not well thought out. There is a zoom in view, a zoom out view, and a zoom out with scrolling view where you can't press many of the buttons. The zoom in is HUGE and useless, the zoom out modes are too close so that you can never see the whole Scrabble board at once! You are forced to scroll the screen to see only portions of the board at a time. Both me and my wife were extremely disappointed by this version of Scrabble. BEWARE, unlike the PC version which is a 5 star version, this version barely gets one star. Unlike the PC version the music isn't very good and you can't change the music, you can never see the whole board when playing, you can't change the type of board you play on, you can't change the view angle, you can't change the background, the tiles look flat and ugly, your tiles on your rack are so HUGE that they block the view of the board extensively. The score (when visible) takes up too much of the screen, and of course makes it difficult to see the board. Fortunately you can turn off the score view. This is a very sad implementation of what is a great game. I don't recommend buying the PlayStation version at all. If you own a PC you are much better off getting the PC version. The PC version is 100 times better than this version is. Hasbro is normally a very good quality company. I'm surprised Hasbro allowed this version to hit the market place.",1.0

"The video game is nowhere near as good as the movie. The video game turns Buzz from a Smart and strong movie character to a weak and dull nintendo character. There are so many things that the video game does wrong! It's to simple, Buzz can't sprint fast or jump high, the graphics aren't so great, and the video game adds characters that aren't in the movie. The number one thing that ruins this game is the video game randomly changes Buzz's voice where he screams. That made no since at all! How did the manage to not use Tim Allen's voice for the screaming Buzz? It sounded like they were using a strangers voice for Buzz's screaming voice instead of Tim Allen's voice! Buzz in not in good shape at all in this whole game, he can't even run as fast as when you race the car in the Any Neighborhood level. Buzz even can't outrun an alien who's running after him in a certain level. Buzz can't always grab onto a ledge when you want him to. Worst of all, Buzz can't perform flips! Buzz is so weak here in the video game, but he's smarter and stronger in the movie. Super Mario Sunshine is a much better video game for nintendo gamecube. Mario makes a lot more since in Super Mario Sunshine than Buzz here in the Toy Story 2 video game. Mario is strong, he can even perform flips, and he can hold on to ledges more 70% of the time than Buzz here in the Toy Story 2 video game. He can sprint fast, and he's in really good shape with his robot friend, Flood, behind his back. In Super Mario Sunshine, Mario is 70% smarter than Buzz here in the Toy Story 2 video game. I'd say watch the movie or play Super Mario Sunshine and don't waist your time or money here!",1.0

Since I do not plan to buy from Amazon providers and I may not buy anything else from Amazon for that matter since they obviously do NOT screen their providers well.

To add insult to injury, they gouged me on the restocking fee of 35% when their site mentioned only a 10-25% restocking fee.  Amazon seem to be encouraging this type of exortion by allowing up to 50% restocking fee.  Meanwhile DealTavern increased their price on Castlevania by 50% more than I paid.

Castlevania 4 was the peak in the series with controls, sound, and enjoyment then they wanted to try something new. Big mistake. Why couldn't they make a game that built upon Castlevania 4. It will always be a mystery to me why SoTN was so well received.",1.0

"It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it ""best game of all-time"" or ""best Castlevania game you'll ever play"".
I don't think so.  If you want a ""real"" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.
Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.
After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.
Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!
But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.
Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.
Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.
You're probably thinking by now ""Alright, talk about the actual GAME!""  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.
Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.",1.0

"Kingpin is the Phantom Menace of video games.  The graphics are breathtaking, especially at 1024 x 768.  It incorporates hundreds of skins and textures to give that seedy, dark atmosphere to the game.  However,  take away the fancy computer graphics and you're left with a terrible plot,  confusing layout and boring gameplay.
There are so many problems I don't  even know where to start.  Enemy AI is best described as psychotic.  They  run around in circles, shooting at the walls.  Often times they run in  squares and incessantly yell insults at you (actually there are about 4  that repeat over and over again).  Enemies are either telepathic since the  instant you unholster your gun, they fire at you.  Talk about your  quickdraws!  Although the plot is decent, the map layout is so confusing  you'll end up circling around yourself looking for the door to the next  level.
And then there's the weapons.  The rocket launcher has a blast  radius of 2 feet.  You literally have to hit your opponent or else they  will kill you.  Also they can jump over rocket explosions.  That's right,  jump over.  The flamerthrower requiries at least 15 seconds to kill anyone.  The Heavy Machine Gun shoots 3 bullets a time, and can kill you from 2  miles away.  The shotgun takes about 10 seconds to reload 8 shells.  And  the grenade launcher can sometimes take out a whole room, while other times  it barely scratches the furniture.
Well if the first person game sucks,  multiplayer should be fun, right?  Nope, guess again.  Even though I'm  running a P2-300 with 192mb ram, 16mb TNT2 video card and a cable modem,  every (I repeat), EVERY, online game I've played has had lag.  We're  talking Grade A, jumbo-lag flown in from Alaska.  I've logged about 40  hours online, and there hasn't been one game where I've seen characters  float in the air, walk in slow motion, or skip to several places at once.  You guessed it, Kingpin is the Matrix of video games!.  As soon as you get  your opponent in your sights, he disappears and reappears several feet  away, conventiently shooting at you.
If you want multiplayer action, get  Unreal Tournament.  If you want violence, gore and some serious gunning  action, wait for Soldier of Fortune.  If you want to curse at the monitor  screen and yell ""work dammit, work!"", by all means get Kingpin.",1.0

"I'm not sure what's wrong with the dice generator on this game or how the odds are stacked. However, I bought this game to have a little fun with a computer opponent(one). Everyone knows that if you play again one opponent the game will go faster. So I like to just spend a short time(an hour or less playing).  However I find that when I play against one computer opponent I will usually lose. For example the computer will usually get first roll and will usually get all properties of one color first. If you don't mind losing time and time again (you're a little masochistic) then this is fun. I have looked for updates or patches to this program but have never seen any that will balance the lopsided 'luck' that the computer usually has. I must say then that the computer has 'loaded dice.' Has anyone else had the same experience? Is this problem corrected in newer versions? I'll give it two stars for the ability to play online against a human opponent but the computer opponent's 'luck' knocks off 4 stars

"To be honest, when I first looked at Battlezone 2, I thought it would be  pretty darn cool, I mean, with graphics like those, what can beat it?  Everything. The first problem I encountered was the excruciatingly long  installing period, which takes about as long as a brick moving 10 yards on  it's own. When I finally woke up and saw the installing program had  finished, I booted up what would be one of the worst gaming expiriences of  my life. After the dull entrance cinematic, I was again forced to wait  another half an hour to get past the frickin' main ""menu"" which  takes you practically straight to the 1- player mode, then gives you 3  seconds to take a quick glance at the crucial controls. The boring  cinematic will have you alreading pulling your hair with it's poor effort  put into it's sound which will make you struggle to hear what the  ""commanders"" are whispering to you. When you actually start  playing, you'll first encounter a rushed, buggy feeling with your ship and  poor brake engine(hope this thing has airbags). The mapping is pretty sorry  itself. A huge map isn't all bad, but if the timed mission is held in only  one hard-to-find location, you could get a little ticked off. The computer  ""animal enemy"" AI misses every shot of the occaisonal fire from  them, and they have a life meter so long you'll be wondering why you just  didn't bring a can of radiation with you.

"A lot of good reviews--two perfect 5 star reviews even. Amazon.com gets to choose which reviews are ""featured"", so that's not really much of a surprise.
You should definitely read more reviews. The graphics are okay, but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many. Bright oranges, glowing blues, and odd color assortments await you in this game. Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone. That was a game I played so many years ago I can't even remember when, but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good. The story made more sense, the missions didn't tell you exactly what to do (you had to figure it out, which was the fun part), and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time. To summarize what these reviews (on the first page) are all leaving out:
- You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves. You'll also have to do this to access the tactical map, the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there (by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed, too little, too late)
- Missions aren't involving, and the story doesn't continue from the original game. In short, there's really not much of a story, as you'll find yourself doing strange things that you've been ordered to do for no apparent reason
- Interface is cluttered, buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things, and it's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle. In many games, the only deciding factor of whether you'll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enough",1.0

"This controller extension worked well enough to be able to get by when I first got it, but was temperamental at best. 99% of the time, if the connection between the controller and the extension moved at all, the controller would stop working, and it had to be unplugged and plugged back in to make it work again. The adapter side that went into the Playstation itself was loose, but never seemed to act up.

This lasted me a couple of weeks before it finally died, and when I went to unplug the controller from the extension in an attempt to make it work again, I discovered that the plastic itself had bent and broken at some point.

This isn't worth the 8 dollars it cost me after shipping.",1.0

Even though these have a great price, I wouldn't suggest ordering them - you're probably better off ordering a higher priced set that will last longer.",1.0
"I got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile. It blows it is a boring extremely hard game. I liked the movie option, graphics and real car phisics. The story was okay not great. The controls were horrible. The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring. The first mission took us 3 weeks to fufill. Also your stuck in the car driving around. The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path. It's not even challenging fun. It is more like boring impossible!! Also you can't see in front of you. I'm still on the first city. On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies. Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway, carnage, surviver and time trials ect. There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies. Also I think this has much improovement from the PS1 version by far. But still this game is horrible. The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving I've ever seen. If you want a fun wide variety driving game for the PC reserve GTA3.
  Pros: Lot's of non story games
  Good Graphics
  Way better than PS1 version
  There is movie editor
  Real Car fisics
  Some might like Story
  Cons: Boringly Hard Story Mode
  Bad Controls
  Game is Uneccesasseraly hard
  Can only stay in car
  Huge lack of Mission Variety
  Large Lack of Car Variety
  Game gets incredably boring and hard
  Missions very unforgiving
  Probily takes at minimum 15 restarts to complete a average missions
  Cops will start a dangerous car chase for speeding and don't stop when you stop to them
  Cops to easily provoked
  Cops go to dangerous lenghts to get you for a minor violation.
  Unrealistic and Dangerous Cop AI
  Can't run over Padestrians

 So if you want a wide variety driving game where you can get out of a car and get in another and more mission variety reserve GTA3.",1.0

The controller came to me with the d-pad nonfunctional. shipping issue? doubtful. Wanted to return the product.. but having to pay the shipping all around for them to send me a new one would have ended up making it cost twice the amount of the controller. Over all it could've been a manufacturer mess up.. but whether or not you want to take that chance is entirely on you. Frankly I think this prob won't be the last time. The controller was very cheaply made. very light cheap plastic.. nothing like the original. My personal opinion: pay a little more and get an original.. they pop up from time to time on here. Its what I did.,1.0

"There is a limited market for this type of thing - and I do not want to be part of it. I enjoy submarine simulations, however I do not want to hunt down and destroy friendly forces.

Software games should try to reinforce good values, traditions and taste.",1.0
"Ah...the WWII U-Boat; it instantly conjures up memories of classic movies such as Das Boot. Imagine the terror of a depth charge attack, the thrill of a successful torpedo attack, and the repugnant stench of forty-four sweating sailors stuck inside a steel cylinder no wider than a city bus...
Well there's none of that here. If Ultimation and Ubi Soft were aiming to create a highly realistic and enjoyable simulation of WWII submarine warfare, they missed. If they intended to create a poorly-coded, antiquated and historically inaccurate pile of unstable hacks, then congratulations. Without a doubt, this was one of the most disappointing games I have ever played, with glaring faults and bugs that should have easily caught by QA.
The graphics are mediocre at best, a fact made worse by SH2's maximum resolution of 800x600. Remember the famous storm scene in Das Boot? Well, in SH2, there are two types of weather: sunny and cloudy. There is no rain, no sleet, no spray in your face, nothing. To SH2's credit, the ship and aircraft models are nicely done, but the pyrotechnical effects are severely underwhelming. While the ship's control stations look decent, there is no control view room. Admitedly this is a quibbling point, but a control room would have made you feel as if you were inside a real U-boat, not just gazing at static displays.
Which wouldn't be so bad if those stations were actually USEFUL. Everything, navigation, rangefinding, attacking, it can all be done from the map view. This is rarely, if ever, any reason to visit the other stations. Particularly useless is the sound station, in which the game automatically marks down contacts, their bearing, and the type of vessel, so all you get to down is simply turn the dial and listen to the sounds of their engines. Speaking of sound, the game's audio is severely lacking. When I hit an oil tanker with a torpedo, I want it to sound as if I am bringing about the end of humanity itself, not a tinny, stock ""boom"" that I have heard in countless games before.
I have never captained a naval vessel in my life, but I am sure such a vocation includes concepts like ""do not run into other ships"" and ""do not run into ground."" Unfortunately, the AI of Silent Hunter 2 seems to have not taken notice of these basic martime rules. In one mission, I was tasked with sinking two British battlecruisers, so I quietly slid into their midst and unleased all my torpedoes against the lead battlecruiser. Shortly afterwards, the trailing battlecruisers gleefully rammed into the flaming hulk of the first battlecruiser, allowing me to pick it off with ease. The nearby destroyers would have been a threat to me had they NOT ALSO RAMMED EACH OTHER AND SUNK coming to attack me! Another time I avoided the H.M.S Ark Royal's destroyer escorts when they ran themselves aground on nearby islands. To add insult to injury, the beached vessels were sticking out of the ground at a 90 degree angle like giant lawn darts. While the AI can be monumentally stupid, it can also pinpoint your exact location 100 meters under the water WITHOUT THE AID OF SONAR and drop depth charges upon your hapless submarine with unerring accuracy.
With the possible exception of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, this has to be one of the most poorly coded simulations I have experienced. While I was successful in running the game under Windows XP, I could rarely complete a mission without a crash to desktop. Other bugs are numerous; sometimes I would lay one waypoint on the map, and the game would lay down 100 waypoints right on top of each other. The pitch of the engines would often remain unchanged, even when I increased speed to flank from a near crawl. It is impossible to play through SH2 without wondering if the developers flunked all their computer science classes. For example, for reasons beyond my explanation, Silent Hunter 2 and vehicle viewer are two seperate programs, so to keep the user from (heaven forbid!) seeing his desktop when switching between the programs, the game actually has a ""SH2 Screen Blanker"" to blank your screen! Such inexplicable programming practices points to a lack of experience on the developer's part.
Even if the game were eventually patched up, I still could not recommend this game. Don't let the current dearth of submarine simulations part you from your hard-earned money. Go play a real WWII submarine sim, like the original Silent Hunter or Aces of the Deep.",1.0

A powerful wizard spell  can wipe the force out in seconds.  The dragons, ""the most terrifying  and powerful of creatures"" fall all too quickly under half-decent  defensive structures.

"I played EQ for about 6 months.  This game has great potential, but is seriously flawed.
Its _NOT_ a ROLE playing game.  There is no way to role play, no changes happen due to your actions.  Indeed, since _most of the  people on the servers do _not roleplay, you attempts to do so are doomed to  failure.  It is a leveling game, pure and simple.
Verant has the _the_  worst customer service I've seen, period.  Problems with the game are not  dealt with, long standing bugs and code flaws are ignored.  A prime  entire time the game has been in existance, despite _months_ of bug reports  and feedback by _hundreds of customers.  Verant couldn't duplicate the bug  in testing, due to a flawed testing approach, and basically concluded that  hundreds of customers were either lying or simply couldn't do the task  properly.
Servers are grossly overcrowded, players will give detailed  reasons why the servers should have an active number of players in the 1000  to 1200 range, yet the servers constantly run about 1800 to 2200.  This  overcrowding seriously hampers game enjoyment of any kind.  Verant views  this as acceptable, and has done little if anything to alleviate this  problem.  New servers pack to overflowing within days of their  launch.
Verant's constant stream of changes and revisions to the game  mean that you can't expect _anything_ to remain stable.  Spells, abilities,  treasure, creatures, skills, all these go through constant changes and  modifications.
Overcrowding and farming of items (gathering items for  sale either in or outside the game) mean that you will have to  wait in line _hours_ realtime to get nice items and equipment.  No, you  can't avoid this, you will actually need ot constantly improve your gear as  you advance, or weaken drastically.  Verant's policy of putting valuable  items on rare spawning creatures, and then only having a small percentage  of that rare occuring creature drop the valued item means tht you will  spend endless frustrating hours (yes, real hours) trying to gather the  gear, and mostly failing.  Oh, and that assumes someone more powerful than  you simply doesn't 'killsteal' the creature, taking it and its loot from  under you nose after you've waited hours.
This game has a lot of  potential, but is too flawed to waste any time or money on.  It will be  remembered as the game that pushed the MMORPG (gah, its not a RPG, but that  the acronym it has).
It will also be remembered as a the game run by a  company making money hand over fist, but absolutely unwilling to spend it  to give its customers the product they both expect and deserve.

"Sorry to burst the bubble of all the people who thought that this would be a great way to roleplay online, because to be honest. I've had the game for a number of months now and I've seen distrubingly low amounts of Role  Playing in this game, if you are one of those people who insisted on  finding every secret in the Final Fantasy series of games, and don't care  if there is an interesting story surrounding your god-like character (which  will take you thousands of gamplay hours to create, and you still will not  be on par with the toughest monsters in the game). Then ignore my one out  of five star rating and knock yourself out.  Oh and as a side note be  prepared to be exploited by Verant at every corner, because to them you are  just $9.89 a month nothing more.",1.0
It didn't work. I  was ripped off!!!!,1.0
"I am actually kind of surprised that Sony and 989 Studios would jeopardize their good names by being associated with the unprofessional service staff  at Verant software.
At first you might think that once you buy a game,  what does it matter how the company runs its customer service? But believe  me, it does. In a game where you can only play online you are at the  complete mercy of your hosts. And if they are poorly staffed with an array  of unhelpful and sometimes arrogant, unprofessional personnel, you are  probably playing EverQuest.
EverQuest is and of itself a fantastic world  of fantasy adventure, and probably one of the best games of its ilk to come  around in a long time. The character designs, graphics, music (when you are  in a place where the game plays music), and gameplay are all very good. The  real problem with this game is the way that Verant handles its customer  support. The term ""customer"" is ironic here because never have I  seen a company treat the people paying its bills with such utter  disregard.
Any time a player has a problem with the game (and plenty crop  up), the only course of action that will have any effect is to  ""petition"" an ""in game"" Verant representative known as  a GM (which is not a highly publicized fact). E-mails to various  ""authorities"" will go unanswered and fruitless long distance  calls Verant's California offices will result in endless run-around to the  point of which one can only conclude that the company is atrociously  organized. When a GM finally has the time to answer (it could be hours),  expect a hasty conversation, contradictory information, and in the end  unsatisfactory results. All this will add up to great frustration while  trying to play the game and a feeling that the company couldn't care less  whether or not you continue to use their service. It is inevitable that  when there is release by another company to rival this game, people will  abandon EverQuest en masse.
The programmers of EverQuest have done a  great job at creating an online 3-D fantasy world. It is perhaps a  testament to their skills that people in great numbers continue to play  this game even though the staff running it could possibly be worst front  line to the consumer ever assembled.",1.0
"The original game EverQuest, was a great idea, but the people at Verant have taken that idea, and bent it out of shape for the only purpose of  slowing down character advancemet so you will have to play longer, and pay  them more money!
This is not an RPG, unless you read that as... Really  Profitable Game!
Varant has some of the worst customer service I have  ever seen in any company, and their basic assuption is, the player is  always lying!
If you don't believe me, check out the EQ web sight message  boards, And see what other players say.  But do it in the next two weeks,  because they are about to clamp down, and censor the boards of any  un-favrorable posts.
They have banned peoples accounts perminatly over  some of the most ludicrus things.  and once your account is banned, you  might as well throw away your CD, because its now useless! if you ever want  to play again, you have to buy a new copy, and start all over with new  characters.
If you enjoy frustration, and boredom, play a character past  about lvl 25, you'll have a ball!
You may find it fun at low levels, but  try to build a high level character, and you hit the ""hell  levels""  that take forever to get through, and then the next level  penaltys for death, are 2-3X normal, and throw you right back into the hell  level!  again, if you don't believe me, check the message boards.  see for  your self!
If you want the most powerful items in the game, expect to  spend 12-18hr non-stop on-line to get them! (this is not an  exageration!)
And even if you totally discount me as a disgruntalled  player,  just check out the web sights, befor you buy this turkey!
Save  your money, much better things are on the horizon!",1.0
"Well don't get too excited.  It seems Verant is interested inselling the scraps ommited from the original design because of the popularity.  But this time with Lizard people!  Woo how unique.

Have fun (I wish they would sell something from the good people at  middle earth)",1.0
"I had fun in Everquest, for a little while.  I could list the things I hated about this game, but I'm going to save the energy.  One thing I must mention is that the gameplay is crap.  The game progresses terribly slow and worst of all it doesnt progress anywhere in particular, just up.  Up  another level, up another level, up another level.  Its about as much fun  as climbing a ladder.",1.0
"When I first played the game I found it very fun and interesting, but the more I played I realized I was doing the same exact things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It became mind-numbingly dull. I only managed to make it to lvl 5 before I couldn't take anymore.
The game has a great concept and the graphics look very nice. I enjoyed playing in a world full of other real people that I could actually interact with. The huge downside is that there is little variety to keep things fresh and interesting. I spent hours upon hours running around killing rats and snakes and whatnot. I would find a rat, hit the ""attack"" key and watch the battle unfold. Yeah, it was sort of cool the first few times, but after hours of doing this I felt my sanity starting to slip away.",1.0

"Daikatana is to computer games as Battlefield Earth is to movies. The plot is one-dimensional and does not let you stray, even to the point of letting your supposedly smart teammates (read: more of a hindrance than a help), keep you back. If a man can't figure out how to walk in a straight line across a bridge, why should I trust him in a fight? Additionally, the enemy AI is alternately idiotic or lethal, with little balance between which road is taken. The weapons range from the interesting to the downright Twinkish. The program itself drains a system of precious resources to accomplish what most other games can outdo with less programming, and with better results. This is a game to avoid. For a truly good game experience, stick to something with more plot, better game engine, and more developed player-to-AI interface.

"""I am only left asking, ""how long until Daikaitaina 2? """" - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!
I really tried to like this game.
I felt like screaming ""Turn the lights on!"" during the first level. What a murky morass. I installed this game twice and I still can't stand it.
What angers alot of gamers is this: We wonder what games didn't get made because ""Daikajokea"" sucked up so much cash?",1.0
"Well, after several years of promises and many delays, Daikatana is  finally here. This will probably go down as one of the worst games in  history. Why do I say this? The game's graphics look ten years old, there  are so many bugs in the game that gameplay is almost impossible, and the  game crashes at random times. However, the worst part is the customer  service. It looks as though Eidos Interactive has already given up on the  game. They keep promising to fix the various problems throughout the game,  but it looks like these promises, just like the original release date, will  be taken care of in about five years. However, there is an upside for  having this game in your home. The box makes a great coaster for your soda.",1.0
"I rue the day this title came out for Playstation. It was considered so original, it influenced many, many stealth-type games that followed it. Too many.

Where do I start with the things I hate about this game?

1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing ""Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!"" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. ""Easy"" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what ""Hard"" mode was like.

2. Way too many cutscenes! I've never seen anything like it. There's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes. This has got to be the talkiest video game I've ever played.  And these dialogues are all so silly, and you're pretty much forced to watch them or you won't be able to understand what's going on. In fact, I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes. It's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.

3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, ""Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!""

4.  Even more excusably, there's not way to pause the cutscenes.  You can't even pause the codec dialogues!

5.  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didn't, the scene would be too easy.

6.  There are far too many boss monsters.  It's like every other encounter is a boss monster.  The first part of the game (say, up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot) is pretty great, but that's not representative of the game:  after that it's basically an unending series of boss monsters.

7.  Frustratingly, you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die.  Having to ""kill"" the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you're going in circles.

8.  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down. Was this written by a 14-year-old?

9.  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time:  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didn't mean to do this.  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still, allowing your enemies to shoot you.  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.

10.  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.

11.  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices, such as the thermal goggles.

12.  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you:  you can't look ahead because your radar is ""jammed"" and then you get shot by a security camera.  Or blown up by a mine.

13.  The way you are prevented, after having killed a boss, from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didn't collect during the battle.  Is it there or not?  So why can't I get it now?

14.  The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game's finale.",1.0
"I bought this game thinking it would be cool, Design your own ships and take em out for a spin, Not the case!  I could do a better job using MS Paint, Major Dispointment! Dont waste your money here, If you looking for a  Star Trek game try Starfleet Command, It rocks.",1.0
"When I first heard of the idea for this game, i thought it would be interesting.  What I didn't relize is there is no ""cross-bredding"" of ships.  You can't have a Galaxy Saucer with  an Akira body with Defiant Nacelles.  Also, they have four presets for each  part, and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer. As  aforementioned, since there is no cross bredding, you cannot make a new  class.  And, one of the true low points of the game is, since you are an  admiral, not a captian, you just send the ship out and your  ""capable"" crew does the rest.  No Control, no nothing.",1.0
Where to begin?  How about...not fun.  Bad graphics+bad gameplay+bad sound+no replay value=bad game.  The saddest part is that Eidos put so much money into this game that good studios (i.e. Looking Glass) ended up  shutting down.  Quake II is still more fun than this!  They should have  pulled the plug on Ion Storm a long time ago.,1.0
"I am going to make this short but true.  First off this game is HARD or at least what I played. this game is no Shoot them all like Quake 2 or anything.  I found this game Repugent.  I don't even want to try it again.  I don't care if you have 1000 weapons, if you can't beat the first stage  with Ease, then forget about the rest.  The Graphics in this game are  Dated back to the DOOM age.  This 5 year opus did not pan out like I  wanted.  I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems  not.  The game might have good points but the save system (save only if you  have a crystal?) is an abomination.  This is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in Console System games, but never should have made it to the  PC.  I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game (Deus Ex) but this one  is just a pile of turds.  Bargin Bin Box.  I also just want to close with  this.  We can now see the real genius behind Doom, and Doom 2, was John  Carmack, not John Romero.  Sorry about being rude and mean, but this game  is really horrible, and I just want to be honest.",1.0
"This game is a major disappointment.  As I played the game, I repeatedly thought ""What were the designers thinking?""
I'm an avid first-person shooter (FPS) player.  I have played every major FPS game out  there.  The first level of Daikatana, for example, is one of the least fun  levels in an FPS I have ever played, ever.  It's very challenging, but that  is because many annoying frogs and mosquitoes attack you and all you have  to defend yourself is a badly-designed gun that shoots bouncing green goo.  This gets old very quickly.  (The game designers compare this to the  fast-paced action of Doom, but Doom is actually fun, and this is incredibly  annoying.) The level itself has a boring design, and is split up into  pieces, with a ""Loading"" screen and pause separating them a la  Half-Life, except the load times are much longer and are accompanied by a  headache-inducing sound effect.  In addition, you must collect ""Save  Gems"" in order to save your game.  For a few minutes I thought  ""Save Gems"" was simply a misspelling of ""Save Games,""  thinking that no sane game designer these days would put such a ridiculous  savegame system in a game.  It makes you want to pull your hair out when  you've just fought off tons of those frogs and mosquitoes for an hour but  die before you find a Save Gem.  Save Gems are a thinly-veiled attempt at  making the game more difficult without actually designing it better.
Why  put up with this junk when there are many better games out there to spend  your money on?
I had high expectations for Daikatana.  It was overhyped,  and of course it couldn't live up to that hype, and that is understandable.  But sadly, Daikatana fails miserably even trying to be average.  If you're  in the market for this sort of game, look almost anywhere else and you'll  find a better game.",1.0
"Dont ever, ever buy this game! I knew it was going to be bad. So far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive, even beating Trespasser by 2 days. A game that took 4 years to develop, well, you know  something's not right. Lets start with the graphics. Really very dated  OpenGL graphics. If this game came out 2 years ago, it would've been  awesome. Interface: No In-Game save. Only way to say your progress is by  picking up Save Gems. No Gems, no save. Control: Ok, so it's like any other  first person shooter which is why I gave this game it's one and only star.  AI: very very bad. Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up.  You'll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you. Also,  there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake.  Story: just watch the old TV series ""Time Tunnel"". Overall: spend  your money on another game.",1.0
"After all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have *something* to recommend it.  Sure, I realized it wasn't going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES.  I always make sure to discount 25% for hype.  But,  my gods, what a poor showing this is!
There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying ""find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc"" style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment.
Well, you get the point.  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $20 on the  discount rack, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed.  As it was, I went back  and exchanged it for ""Soldier of Fortune"" which, well also not  ground breaking, is solidly entertaining and, at least, mildly  innovative.
Please, folks, don't get sucked in by the hype.  Save your  money for something better.  In the meanwhile, I'll be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product, Deus Ex, does a better job of living up to its  reputation.",1.0

"To put it simply, I would rather undergo a visectomy via weedwacker than play this game again.  When I first played it, I was convinced it was going to be good because I everything else about the game was good.  It cost 7 bucks and I didn't even have to pay for it.  The title was pretty good and the screenshots were appealing.  When I played the game, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  One of my friends later pointed out that I was in ""Bad Game Denial.""  This game's graphics were comparable to Pong, and Arkanoid 1.  It was so dark that I had difficulty distinguishing walls from crudely-drawn, sword-wielding skeletons.  When running, attacking, casting spells, and performing simple actions, my character, regardless of who I chose, looked like a perturbed fetus.  His/Her facial features looked very similar to a peach-colored grape.  He was constantly hunched over like an old man facing arthiritis in virtually his entire body.  My character's grunts when he was being hit were similar to the sounds that come from a rhinocerous in labor.  The motion his body made when he swung a sword or staff or whatever were like a door on its hinges.  I spent many hours after my realization laughing incontrollably like a psychopath at the sheer stupidity of it all.
Graphics: 4  I can only give it this much because of the chicken that runs around in town.  That little guy made me laugh and he was well made.
Character Structure: 2  The characters, for the most part, looked like a pillow for their torso, and string beans for their arms and legs.
Storyline: 3  The basic story is that for some reason or another, you're supposed to collect 6 or 7 crystals.  I got as far as the second crystal, but then, there just weren't anymore quests to do.
Gameplay: 4  You can cast a variety of spells and use more than a few different weapons.  However, since it has a very Diablo style form of gameplay, (except not as good) it got old very fast.

In each ""game"", Elmo moves around a virtual hallway, looking for a specific letter/number. When he touches what he's looking for, he gets a good point.

Don't get me wrong it might be fun.  Good concept, interesting  story,  Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights.

One time I went to Wal-Mart and I saw one of them there games of yours and I saw it was for sale at ten dollars and that there.  It was Specops stealth patrol and I bought it thinking it was a good bargain.  Needless to say it is a horible game with long loading time really bad graphics I could not see the bad guys my eyes were open. The main menu was low tech and the soldiers disguisedly grunted like pigs.  At eb they said they would only give me 4 bucks and that there.,1.0

"We bought this for our child and were very dissapointed. First, the controls were very inacurate causing her to constantly feel like she wasn't ""good"" at it. We encouraged her that she is great...the game is the problem! Not a reccommendation for children's self-esteem. Then the game was boring after just a week. We finally shelfed it and won't even sell it as we feel so strongly that it is not properly marketed as a children's game. Very poor.",1.0

"This game was terrable.  Bad graphics, bad plot, classic moves and gameplay gone, it was not made by the same comepany who made the first two,  and it ended up when it was done to only seem like a good idea!  This is  another great game that got killed when it was trasfered to 3D (Bubsy 3D  anyone?), and just lacks more thought.  Now this doesn't mean there's no  hope for another Earthworm Jim game, Sonic had a few dissaster's in the 3D  world on Saturn until SEGA learned to use the classic moves and feel to a  Sonic game, so Jim might have a chance.  But I think he should make one  more 2D game before entering the 3D world again.",1.0
"This game was one of the worst games that PlayStation extricated.  The game sounds diabolical because you hear that you are a crook doing stuff for the mob.  The graphics are worse than horrible, all you get is a birds-eye view and crooked dialogue, such as ""Gimme that..........""  What's even worse is that there is going to be a GTA3 that will come out eventually.  What I really want to tell you is, stay away from this [game]!",1.0
"I bought this game and I have to say that this is a game worth NOT buying because I have been a gamer all my life and I have never turned off a video game within a minute of playing time.

1. Controls are horrible.

2. Who cares that the charecter can burp and fart

3. The graphics are ridicuous for a playstion one system. These are the kind of graphics that you would find on the the first video game systems ex: Atari, NES or game boy pocket. If you want a game that you would like buy any of the GTA games on the playstion 2 system. Dont buy this game.",1.0
"Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.

The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that, my friends, is a sad, sad thing indeed.

The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all. Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.

I love GTA. It's a great game, but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999. It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.

I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar.",1.0
"I had this game a while ago. I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version. I liked being able to play a girl, and to get a cat, and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites (all other HM recently, I've noticed you NEED them...I'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it)...but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.

And thats not the worst of it...

This is a 'real time' game, and after a while, either it decides you're not playing enough, or the time system just breaks...either way, unless you play it almost nonstop, it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.

Its good fun while it lasts...but it doesn't last long enough to even win it.",1.0
"I was hoping for an addictive tetris game, but ended up with a rather weak attempt to revive a classic game.  You can get the same excitement from the free tetris-type clones that you can download off the web.
In my mind, the best tetris-type attempt is still yoshi's tetris attack for the super nintendo.  Now that was an addictive game.  Which makes me depressed that nintendo does not support the playstation with some of their games.",1.0
"Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this (cough) classic I decided to give it a second chance.

Sound: 1 out of 5 (fairly decent sound effects, bad music)
Controls: 1 out of 5 (these are the worst controls ever)
Fun Factor: 1 out of 5 (I still returned it the next day)
So there you have it.  This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again.  Word of advice, buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3, you will not regret that financial investment.",1.0

Okay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in 3D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk4 in 3D that just puts the other ones to shame. so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks don't even buy it i don't recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game that's why i gave it 1 stars,1.0

"I just wasted thirty bucks on this ..game. I bought it for my son, who was very excited about purchasing it. After reading several of the reviews on here, I thought it must be a good game (Most of the reviews are favorable).  The player spends most of his time at a boring ranch. Each month, you choose one type of food, and one type of training for your monster. It seemed as if no matter what combination we chose, we either ran out of money or the monster decided it did not want to do what we told it to. This is called ""foolery"". If your monster has a high foolery rating, it will not behave during a battle, and it will get stomped on. Even the very first battles seemed impossible to win, and after owning this game for three days, I have taken it back and sold it as a used game.  Also worth mentioning is the fact that there are no open areas to walk around in (like in Pokemon for game boy color), and the entire game is very linear and limited. It promises unlimited combinations of monsters from other CD's but you have to win special badges to be able to access this feature (we could only do it with the help of the game shark, and even then the game was extremely boring and not playable). Rent before you buy, or buy at your own risk!",1.0
"Tecmo took an unnecessary chance creating Monster Rancher 2. I cannot see how any human being in their right mind could possibly enjoy this excuse of a game. As if the original wasn't torture enough, Tecmo had to put us through the agony of a sequel. You might as well take your hard-earned money and burn it. Throughout the game, nothing is done by the player, except making selections from a menu. There is no hint of creativity behind the production of this failure. No person should waste any amount of money for this piece of garbage.",1.0

It took me to a weird screen and I could not figure out how to start up the game. Maybe I'm just a n00b but I'd never seen this screen before and tried everything to no avail. Definitely disappointing and I will order through someone else to see if it works.",1.0
"I first bought this game in a Hastings book store a long time ago and I've been a Mk fan for quit some time, so I went ahead and bought it thinking ""This is great! I've got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it. And Midway makes really great games.(LOL) And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin. This is truly a lucky day for me.""
Until I played it....

Then as time went on, I kept it in my basement, and then one day I decided to bring it out because I hadn't played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves. So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again. Then I remembered why I put it the basement. What I should have done was bury it in the back yard, never to see the light of day again.
As soon as the first round said ""FIGHT"" I might as well thrown in the towel. The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was 99.9% dead anyway, I mean, what the F is the point?!

I don't even think the skill level even works.
The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro, (he's your best bet.)
If you play as Motaro you will get your a** handed to you literally! (Pun intended).  The A.I. actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen! But if you were to uppercut the A.I. Motaro, he only staggers, can't have him flying into the air, oh no, that would require fairness in the game.

MK has been known for the copy and paste routine on characters, and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it. The male and female ninjas, and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at Wal-Mart and calling them cyborg ninjas, you know this is a cheap a** game. What the hell was this game made off of, a 50$ budget? I guess Wal-Mart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale.

If the Matrix was to take a glitchy $***, I'm sure that it would look something like this. For every time it loads a match, I can actually hear my PS one groaning like it was trying to pass a cinder block.
If that PS could talk it'd say, ""Oh lord... please... help me!"" :(...

I can see now why it was in five dollar bin, but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it, and if I knew then before I bought it, I would have said; ""Hey, this is in the wrong bin.""

Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordan's big fat head keeps popping out saying ""Toasty."" I wouldn't be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen pop-out of the corner and say; ""Already got your money dude.""

And when it says on the back of the game. ""Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death."" That's you, your the opponent. The A.I. will make sure of that.

As for brutalities, who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes? Wow. I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before. Apparently Ed or any of the designers of this pile of $*#& game, doesn't know a damn thing about the human anatomy. Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves, now this?

To sum it up.
The game play was awful.
The A.I. is cheap.
Glitchy as hell.
They copy and paste the characters as they always do.
The option menu is useless.
The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato.
The audio is awful.
And the story sucked.

Forget water-boarding. Forget Guantanamo bay. That would be considered a health spa compared to this game. S*#$, force a terrorist to play this game for 8 hours strait, and he'll tell you on how to cure any form of cancer.

I can't believe how these retailers on here are pricing this POS at $99.99. Hell, there's some retailers on here that are ranging this torture device, at $150.00. Yeah, good luck with that guys. You let me know how well that works out for ya.
Any poor bastard that was unfortunate enough that played this atrocious, inhumane, intolerable game, with a brain stem knows, this game couldn't be given away.

This game is ranked right next to the Jumanji board game, both should be thrown into the sacred ark, welded shut, put into a create, and shipped to a warehouse somewhere, and there it will be ""dealt with TOP... MEN."" Because this game will melt your face off while you're screaming in agony.

Looking back on my teenager days where I was young, dumb, full of ***,  and didn't know any better, I was easily manipulated into crap like this. So of course I would defend games that I didn't know anything about. Of course I would deny that I've been taken advantage of.  And now we see the same types of teens that are doing this all over again. They'll read this review and say, ""Oh how dare you talk that way about MK! Even thou I didn't grow up with it... bla, bla, bla."" I doubt that any one of them ever played this game on a PS 1. They'd argue that they'd played it of off their iphone or somethin', and say it's the same thing. NO! By then, the bugs have been fixed and it's NOT THE SAME. YOU'RE PLAYING IT FROM A PHONE! It has to be from a P...S...1! Hell to them they'd considered it a retro game. They can't judge a game accurately that wasn't in their childhood. All they can do is look at it from a future point of view. As for us 80's babies, we grew up with this crap. It's only right that we judge it from OUR timeline, no one else's.  And it's hard even to this day, to let go of something that, even thou I've been scammed by marketing-ploys by some cheap broken product, I grew up with them. But ultimately, you have to say to yourself, that I've been had and it's time to let go.

I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless you enjoy yelling at your TV screen all night, then look no further.
But if you care about your sanity, and want to keep it intact. Then stay the hell away from this thing!  You'll find no entertainment from it. And that's where it fails, it fails at what the main purpose of this game was made for, ENTERTAINMENT!

All it will do, is poison and scar your mind for life. You'll never be the same again.
You'll feel cheated, lied to, manipulated, used, frustrated, raped and robbed.
That's what you'll be left with. Enjoy.",1.0
"I'm sorry to tell you this, but this game is not all it is cracked up to be.  Let's start with the original - ""Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain"".  This is a classic.  The game is a little crude, suffers a little from slowdown and is a little badly esigned when it comes to menus.  However, it is a class game, filled with excellent features and is pure sadistic fun.
The sequel you would expect to follow on from this, improvind on its predecessors shortcomings.  The game starts well - it looks promising.  Nice graphics and vampire slaying is fun.  However, the promise ends here.  This game bores very quickly.  the story line is weak, and the gameplay is repetive.  Puzzles are irritating from the point of view that as the game progresses, the same puzzles crop up - they just take loger to complete.  This will soon bug you in such a way that you hope that at the completion of the puzzle, the game will be over.
The bad news doesn't stop there.  One of the best points of the original was the vast array of spells ypu could obtain.  Call me sick, but I found imploding people a hell of a lot of fun.  In Soul Reaver, not only are the spells hidden away in the most obscure areas but they are absolutely useless.  you may spent 30 mins getting a spell to find out it is utterly devoid of purpose within the game.
If you liked the first one, do yourself a favour and remain tru to its purity - do not poison it with this poor excuse to make money.",1.0

Nothing is explained

Lame powers

Poor boss fights

Easy to get lost

You have to shift inbtween worlds to advance

How does that work?
It doesnt. Hes shifting from life & dead

"Looking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you. Well this game is for you. I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance. His favorite games soon showed me that he really wasn't all that bright. He said (In a gay womenly voice) ""Hey try this game out."" So I said hey what the hell. As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it. So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it. So after a couple of trys it finally ran. So the title screen appeared...I never knew this was an alien/vampire porno flick. The idea of impailing naked green ""Slaughs"" as their called in the game isn't my idea of a thrill. After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy. Wow now I know im scared. Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds (one retarted...another more retarted) is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sh*t. Answer me this: If a vampire/gay alien, has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk? Its amazing!! ""Feed on the balls of your enemies"" ""Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet!!"" The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire. His arch enemy is another vampire but is about...I don't know a billion times better then him (Just a rough estimate). The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo. WOW THREE HITS!! Then press x to dodge/lunge and triangle to impale. Oh the complexity. My mind strains over this sh*t. Well if you like to get off to blue alien like men...Go for but I suggest you don't waist your money.",1.0
Didn't work upon arrival. My N64 wouldn't recognize the game at all. I asked for a return/exchange but I was supposed to pay for shipping back to the seller.

"Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games. Those being of course,Special Forces and Shaolin Monks. The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place. I guess you could call it a pre-quel. The gameplay is absolutley terrible. The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game. MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences. As many have said,this game is extremly difficult. Hell,I had a VERY hard time beating it,with cheat codes...and with it being on very easy. All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies. There is also puzzle solving as well. Most of which will have you pulling out your hair. Overall,This game is crap and you shouldn't waste one dollar on it. Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well.",1.0
"I was suprised to read that other people have played this game.  I have windows XP and I cannot get it to play.  If someone can tell me how you got this to play, I would very much appreciate it.",1.0
"Absolutely the lamest adventure game I've ever played.  Almost no gameplay in it at all.  Extremely annoying sequence in which you're stuck with nothing to explore, but you have to keep poking around aimlessly until you get a line of dialogue from your ghost.  Two places in which the game hung completely and my machine had to be rebooted.  (Do not touch locked doorknob until you have key!!  Do not touch trapped clown!!!!)
Game is comprised of simple inventory manipulations, with lots of moving around between each step.  Only minor puzzles, and few of them at that.  Movement is annoying, sight angles are unclear in most of the scenes; very confusing to figure out where you are standing and what you can look at.
If you liked Obsidian, or Neverhood, or Rama, or Curse of Monkey Island, DO NOT BUY AMBER: Journeys Beyond!!!  It will be a complete waste of your money and time.",1.0
"I really did not enjoy playing Amber.  I found the puzzles random, easy,  and not interesting in the least.  The whole game was very short, and the  resolution wasn't satisfying.  The idea in this game is to find out how  each ghost in this house died.  You have a device that measures sound  waves.  For each ghost you journey back in time.  The settings are fairly  interesting, but each is also very creepy.  Again, I would not suggest this  game.  At the end I felt like I had wasted my time and money.",1.0
"This controler stinks.  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing.

The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action.  Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine.  Enjoy!:(",1.0
I made the mistake of purchasing two of these controllers.  It took me several tries to get them to initialize with the Dreamcast.  Many times I'd attempt to move my game character up only to see him moving left.  I returned both of them the next day.  The salesman said he'd seen these controllers returned more than any other in the last 2 years.  He told me that most of the other Mad Catz junk that the store attempted to sell usually got returned as well.  The original Sega controllers are far superior in every sense of the word.

"Everything about this game is terrible, which is surprising since ID used to make the most amazing games. Let's face it- since John Romero left everything has gone downhill. Rather than anxiously awaiting each level, I constantly asked myself ""Will this game ever end?""
The music is horrible- repetitive generic metal songs with occasional electronic elements. The monsters are boring and overused. The levels are for the most part bland, though a few do stand out. The  main character also seems to have 6 different voices.
There is absolutely no story whatsoever. It's just the same ""Go to this room and get this item so you can go to next the room"" type of game (Wolfenstien 3D, Doom, Heretic), poorly disguised. In fact, when you beat the game, instead of finding out what happens you get a screen which reads ""THE END.""
The worst part has to be the weapons, however. The Super Shotgun goes through ammo like crazy, the Machine Gun constantly raises itself when firing so you have to keep tapping the fire button or soon you'll be shooting above your enemies, the Rail Gun takes about a second to fire, then needs to recharge itself, the Rocket Launcher also has a recharge period, and the BFG takes forever to even fire! Much longer than the original took.
In short, this game was a complete letdown. I should have spent the money on a disk of Doom wads instead.",1.0
"I used to love playing Quake 2. I played it for hours on end. When I heard about it's impending release in 1997, I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out. And what did I do when it did?

(Well, at least for 10 years or so) My point is, after you log hours and hours of gameplay, it starts to get old. FAST. Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you don't overindulge.

"I first played this game when it was released 14 years ago. I feel compelled to finally write a review because I am very agitated by the countless amount of 5 star reviews and the high acclaims and praises that this game has garnered. One of the best Final Fantasy games, if not THE best in the series? Psssh. Please.

I must start off by saying that the plot had A LOT of potential. I actually enjoyed this game at the very beginning. I had liked Squall a lot and I found his cold, often downright mean personality hillarious, but it also made me more curious, or concerned, about this character. He was very intriguing. I was also intrigued by Seifer and his rivalry with Squall, as well as his strained relationships with just about everyone. It was a definate foreshadow of a conflict that was meant to evolve into something much, much more. I was VERY interested. Especially when the team all becomes SeeD's! I wondered where their missions would take them and how they would continue to development. But that was when the story went downhill for me. Meeting Rinoa during their first mission was supposed to be some kind of turning point for Squall, but it was actually the most annoying encounter ever. She was very aggravating and would be aggravating for most of the game. Was this game really supposed to be based on a love story? It didn't seem natural...at all. Rinoa was obessessive and soon the team became obsessive with making them fall in love. Squall didn't even have a choice; he was PUSHED to tolerate and then finally ""fall in love"".

Enough on the very weak theme of ""love"" in this game... Lets move on to how weak the overall story was written that the writers had to formulate random, senseless situations into the storyline in a desperate attempt to bind the plot together and to cover up holes. 1: When the team ""suddenly"" discovers that they were all raised in the same orphanage as kids. I remember playing through this scene for the first time and thinking, ""They can't be serious..."" Dumbest. Discovery. EVER. It was extremely random, so random that I actually got frustrated. But not as frustrated as... 2: ""Hey do you remember Matron?"" ""Oh yeah, she looks a lot like Sorceress Edea...oh wait; she IS Sorceress Edea!!"" *Gasps* It just kept getting worse and worse. Where were all these ""memories"" and realizations coming from?! It was so random. Was this supposed to invoke more curiosity and interest in me? Was it supposed to ""move"" me? It felt TOO INSINCERE. I felt NOTHING. Oh, and guess what the writers use as the culprit for the memory lapses? The GF. Oh how convenient. *rolls eyes* 3. NORG. Another random character and scenario that was totally pointless, but I guess the writers had to find some way/someone to spill the beans on Sorceress Edea and Headmaster Cid's marriage. He was conveniently and randomly written in the story to be angry enough to tell the team about their matrimoney. Oh what a shocker that was... *rolls eyes* There were other scenes in the game where I was so frustrated with the random situations that were OBVIOUSLY thrown in the plot to connect already weak dots. Don't even get me started on Sorceress ULTIMECIA...the most random idea of them all...!!!!!! >_< If the writers would have put more thought and LOGIC into this story, such stupid and random scenarios and characters would not have to be thrown in...

And the Laguna ""dreams."" Oh. My. God. ZzzzZzzzzZzzzz. The idea of it was interesting, I have to admit. But the stories themselves I found very, very boring. I didn't enjoy Laguna's character, honestly. His story just failed to captivate me. My curiosity to know what the heck was the point of it all was what got me threw it. And when I found out that it was all Ellone's doing because she wanted to see ""how much her dear Uncle Laguna loved her"" I nearly threw my controller at the screen. More stupidity and simplicity. It just NEVER ENDS. Like I said, the IDEA of the Laguna experience was interesting. I really liked how Laguna turned out to be Squall's father and Julia turned out to be Rinoa's mother. Though Laguna and Julia were never met to be, Squall and Rinoa were. Laguna being an ex-Galbadian soldier in the war COULD have been made more interesting. I would have liked to see more emphasis placed on Laguna and Raine. Laguna visiting her grave at the end of the game and having flashbacks did nothing for me because...the execution of those two during the game was just so weak. I didn't feel for either characters. I also didn't feel for Ellone. I just found the bonds in this game so devestatingly WEAK. I felt for NONE of them!

And then...there is the much despised JUNCTION SYSTEM... I'm going to avoid writing an essay on how much I hated the Junction System by just higlighting its main flaws in points...
1. Your character's stats (strength, defense, agility, etc.) depended on the number of magics you draw and ""junction"" to that stat. The strongest/most valuable magic gives you the best augmentation of these stats...SO DON'T USE YOUR MAGIC, GUYS! Your character's effectiveness in battle depends on it. :-/ Oh, and I have to add that a lot of the magic is quite weak anyway...
2. Drawing magic from monsters is long and tedious. It gets old REALLY quickly. Actually, I think that drawing the spells was like 50% of the game...
3. GF's give your characters all their abilities. You can switch GF's around any way you like on whatever character. When you are forced into a scenario where you must use certain characters is when this gets really upsetting because you could have your ""main"" party all set up with the GF's and magic junctioned and that gets ALL MESSED UP when you suddenly have to use a whole new party and reassign them with GF's and magic, etc... Again, this gets old REALLY quickly...
4. You are only allowed 4 ability slots... >_<

Other irritations in the game... I think that the music was also very weak, especially compared to VII. Someone commented that it was a bit childish and it definately was...perhaps because most of the characters were childish in this game as well. It just set a tone in this game to not take things seriously. I liked Eyes On Me and its different variations...and that was it. Speaking of childish characters, you have Laguna, Selfie, and Irvinne who all reminded me in the worse way that they were adolescents. (Shockingly, Laguna in his dreams was supposed to be older but you can't tell.) I was 11 when I first played this game and even I was rolling my eyes at how juvenile and ANNOYING they all were. ESPECIALLY when the team came together to push Squall to ""love"" Rinoa. Ugh, it was all so aggravating!

So what DID I like about this game? The very beginning of the game before Rinoa entered the picture. I actually digged the card game and I was OBSESSED with finding all of the cards. And some of the side quests were cool, like the ones in trying to find the hidden GF's. That's about it...

People who were so ""mesmerized"" by this game are probably also intrigued by a dog chasing its tail in circles. This game was very poorly written and a complete JOKE. I'm not sure how you could take 90% of this game seriously. The writers obviously didn't take it seriously when they devised this garbage plot with its random scenarios and characters thrown into it just to make a complete story. TERRIBLE.",1.0

"I've played the Quake III Arena demo (Q3A) and the Unreal Tournament Demo (UT), and, with UT coming out first, I see no reason whatsoever to buy Q3A.  The demo was extremely disappointing, with minor gameplay updates and more  visually distracting textures, but essentially this game (Q3A) appears to  be little more the original Quake with better graphics, but without a  significant single player mode.  (Single player mode is like multiplayer  deathmatch mode, except you're killing AI bots intstead of other players.)  The game taxes even the newest computer hardware, but without significant  draw.
Unreal Tournamnet was released first, and it too features a  single player mode much like Q3A, but it also has multiplayer (single  player with bots) missions that are at least fun.  I would encourage anyone  who is considering the mistake of purchasing Q3A to go for UT  instead.
John Carmack and his buddies at ID seem to have missed the  reason for the intense popularity of Half-Life and it's many online  modifications.  (Team Fortress Classic, CounterStrike, etc.)  These games  have appeal because they have a goal that is not merely killing the enemy  as many times as possible.  Unlike Q3A, which is, in the lingo, just a  frag-fest.
The bottom line is: For me, it was a great, great  disappointment.  I have no use for a game that merely features mindless  killing, and I won't buy Q3A.",1.0

"I have played and beaten nearly every Final Fantasy game (1,4,6,7,8,9,10,10-2,12, and some of the offshoots like Mystic Quest and Tactics) and I can safely say that FF8 is THE WORST one EVER made.  Don't believe the mass hysteria which seems to have afflicted these poor people who say it was the BEST.  I honestly have no idea where that could be coming from.  The characters are terrible (ESPECIALLY Squall) and I didn't find myself caring who lived or died.  The plot was utter nonsense, and all the relevant points were just thrown in at the beginning of Disc 3 without any kind of warning.  Leveling up means NOTHING, since the GFs are the only way to get anything DONE in the battles.  Magic?  Forget it: it's useless.

I could go on for pages about the flaws in this game, but there's really nothing I can add that the few sane people who also despised it haven't said yet.  The ONLY redeeming feature is the graphics, which were way ahead of their time.  The plus side of having trudged through the Long-Line-at-the-DMV that was FF8 is that now, NOTHING Square Enix can do could possibly disappoint me more, so I'll pretty much give any piece of crap they come up with in the future a big ""thumbs-up"" (guess where).",1.0

"In Japan, it was called that this game was the worst Final Fantasy until Final Fantasy X-2 was put on the market. Its Graphic is the super-beautiful at that time. I admit it. However, other part is not good. I feel that this game left more important parts than graphic...  I actually played this game for more than 99 hours. But I was not able to consider this game to be a good game. Actually this game is called ""Kusoge-"" (name applied to a bad game in Japan).

I will explain why this game is bad.

First, characters. Squall's character is too gloomy. ""So, speak to the wall!"" is very disappoining. I think that hero should not use such a serif. However, Rinoa's character is worse. It is a famous story that so many Japanese players dislike her.

Story is bad. Everything is made for Squall and Rinoa. Other characters are only supporting them. When did Squall come to like Rinoa?

The battle system is bad, too. Usual attacks are too weak. So, you have to use G,F. However, G,F's scene is too long! And you cannot skip it. Whenever G,F is used, you must watch these long scenes. Thanks to this, the battle is very troublesome. So, many players want to avoid battle. It is out of the question that battle is not interesting in RPG...

In Japanese Amazon, a lot of other faults are talked. The average evalution is 3.3 stars. I wondered to see this game had received the high appraisal here...

Thank you for reading this unskilled English.",1.0
"Good gravy.  What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one?!  It's terrible in almost every aspect.

First of all, the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities.  This means that if you use them, your skills actually decrease.  Not only that, but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99, you're actually susceptible to the nervewracking ""Level 5 Death"" spell.

Secondly, the cast is shallow and characterless.  The main character is grumpy and unsociable, and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to.  Also, none of the other cast are very memorable, like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.

Lastly, the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of... well, you get the idea.  The story begins all right, but then lapses into a nauseating, mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival's ex.  Not only that, but the main character's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the ""villain"" is really after; they never give you a deep enough look at her.

So, really, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, skip this one.  You didn't miss anything.",1.0
"I hadn't played an FF game for a long time, so I picked up FFX, hoping that all the good pub this game got would be true.  Alas, it was not.  FFX was a wretched game, no doubt.  Disgusted after spending 40 hours, I went back into the series, having heard that the earlier games were better.  My best buy had FFVIII on sale for like $15, so I bought it, figuring it couldn't be worse than X.  I was wrong.  Where to begin?  I'll start with the music, which is really repetitive.  It's really not even that good.  Next, the storyline, which is SO bizzare.  So Edea is the enemy.  No, she's being possessed by some other person.  Who you've never heard mentioned.  Not once, until the 3rd disc.  WTF?  The draw/junction system is horrendous as well.  Why can't I use the MP system?  But my biggest complaint with this game is the GFs.  At least by FFX they were smart enough to have the option to eliminate the intro scene.  NO such option here.  And I looked HARD.  Each one requires a year and a day to summon, so you just sit and watch Leviathan materialize, create a slide, and drop water down it.  How impressive.  If each character is summoning a GF, you could get up, drive 3 hours away to pick up some shoes on the side of the road, come back home, make dinner, eat, go to the bathroom, and sit back down and Pandemona would still be firing its attack.  And you can't avoid this, because your characters are so weak physically, that you must use them at least twice a battle.  In the event you find enough items to improve your weapon, this amount decreases, but you still use nothing but GFs during boss fights.  You don't even use real magic!  Why?  because using magic takes away defense points from your junction system!  You may use heal and status magics, but blacks are out of the question.  Besides, they're weaker than the GFs!  Even when triple cast, a triple cast blizzaga is weaker than Shiva!  Who thought of this?  I'm about 1/3 way through the 3rd disc, and I really don't even want to finish it.  When I found out the same people who designed this game designed X, it came to me as no surprise.  So many bad things about this game were evident in X, it was eerie.  Shame on square for allowing the makers of this game to make X.",1.0

"I found Final Fantasy VIII to be the one of weakest Final Fantasy games yet (this is only because I haven't played the NES ones.  But they're probably more entertaining than this, at least for their comedic value).  Okay. The plot got off to a promising start, but quickly fizzled into a contrived, ridiculous mess.  A few of the characters seemed interesting in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle of the game the makers decided to give them all the same past (which is moronic and unbelievably farfetched) instead of giving their characters any depth or personality.  They even all looked the same: no more ""fanciful"" Red XIIIs or Gogos or green-haired Rydias.  Just a group of whiny, self-absorbed 17 year olds who are about as interesting as Saved By the Bell characters.
  In what could have been a turn for the better (but wasn't), the second half of the game completely focuses on the two main characters and their love affair.  Predictably, the girl is whiny, annoying, and chatty - not a single endearing personality trait.  The boy started out as a potentially interesting character, until he meets girl, falls in love, and we, the players, are subjected to an embarassing, excruciating love sequence that's made *even better* by some cheesy pop song assaulting our ears.  Shame, shame.
  Ok, had my character soapbox, now moving on to the plot.  Got off to a (pretty) good start.  The backstory involving wacky Laguna and his pals kept me interested for a while, as did the evil sorceress Edea, who seemed like a pretty cool villain.  Yeah.  She seemed even cooler after you learned the sinister secret about her past (Sarcasm detector, go off now, please).  Well, she eventually gets replaced by, I dunno, some random sorceress chick from the future who's up to no good, someone we, as gamers, are supposed to be really motivated to destroy.  The plot starts to make less and less sense as you go along, until it sinks altogether, amid talks of ""time compression"" and evil future sorceresses or some other pointless junk. Anyways, this is about the point I turned it off (over four years ago) so I don't know if it gets any better in the last section of the game, nor do I care.
  Graphics, good.  Gameplay, bad.  Your characters are physically weak, which cause an overreliance on those flashy summon monsters, and don't even get me started on the draw system.  There was some other really pointless system that I don't remember the name of.  Oh well.  You don't even get money after battles, you get a salary at random intervals.  Everything that makes Final Fantasy, well, Final Fantasy, is completely thrown out the window in this game (yes, there are chocobos, but it's the lamest chocobo system yet, and will probably remain so for many years to come).  I guess if you're really into graphics (although people who play games for just for that typically aren't the world's biggest RPG fans) then you'll enjoy this game.  It also has a really cool opening number.  There, I said something positive.  ^_^  Buy FF7, people!  Even if the characters are blocky and awkward-looking, and the translation is hilariously shoddy at times, it will be a much better way to spend your time.  Promise.",1.0
"This game was a major disappointment.  Not only are the graphics and sound mediocre, but most importantly, the gameplay and control are some of the worst I have ever seen.  Poor control the first time around was ok in the original Tomb Raider, and poor control for the second time was accpetable  in Tomb Raider 2.  Poor control for the third time in Tomb Raider 3 is  unacceptable, and is even more pathetic for the FOURTH TIME in this latest  installment.  It is quite frustrating to get stuck on one of the starter  levels because you cannot make a simple jump because the controls are so  sluggish.  I thought that after three years, Eidos would have addressed  these issues and fix this problem, but they have not done anything to help  the situation at all.  The game also suffers from poor camera angles.  When  I play games, I like to actually see where I am going and what I am doing.  This is often not the case in Tomb Raider 4.  This game offers nothing that  the original didn't, except for the extra 30 bucks you have to pay to get  it.  This is the most disappointing game I have purchased this year.  If  you are in the market for an adventure game, get Indiana Jones and the  Infernal Machine.  That game is far from perfect as well, but at least your  character actually responds to your commands.",1.0
"I caught on to the fervor, and succumbed to the advertising blitz for this game.  I was very disappointed.  The graphics are good, but that should be expected for a game in 1999, when considering other 1st/3rd person games  like Half-Life or Unreal.  With a half-decent plot, this game could have  been better, but the steep learning curve and secrets too subtle to be  found without a guide turned me off immediately.  I uninstalled it today  and am back to playing Broodwars, out 40 bucks.  Learn from my mistake and  avoid this ""game.""",1.0
"Before buying this game, I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first.  As a fan of many of the ""God Games"" out there, I found this one very unintuitive.  In short, all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things.
For instance,  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the Nile River rises.  The question isn't ""what's causing this  person to just sit there""... the question is ""why is this even  occurring?""
That's just one example, there are many, many, more.  Another example?  Ok, I got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave.  Then, six months later, they'd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year.  Does this make any sense?
I found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring.  The object of the game isn't to build an empire, it's to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thought.
This is just the demo, folks!  I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real deal.

"For those of you that are true Final Fantasy fans (like myself) you rushed out to buy FF VIII long before I wrote this review, so this is to appeal to the non-FF fans, and I only write it out of a sense of warning.
FF8 is by far the worst of the Final Fantasy games, to the point of me wishing I'd never bought it, and just skipped to 9, which made everything all better.
FF8 is pure eye candy.  It's a gorgeous, beautiful game, with wonderful FMV's, rotating camara angles, unbelievably smooth movements...
Unfortunately, it doesn't have anything else going for it.  The music is repetative and annoying, the story is non-existant, unexplained and lacks transitions. (Who the heck is the last boss and how did she get into the story again?  Tossing someone in there at the last second does not make her worth fighting.) There are times when you have to wander around completely on your own without having any idea where to go next, or what to do.  The characters are totally shallow, and not even one time during the entire game do they actually -develop-.  They just run around from Point A to point B, and accomplish said nonexistant plot.  The Guardian Force system is so complicated it's just not even funny.  Most players will spend more time in the GF window trying to correctly setup their characters since the auto-setup doesn't really do it correctly.  Add to that an incredibly boring combat system, where you have to sit around for hours on end 'stealing' spells from enemies because the creators wanted to dispence with the MP system... Oh yeah, and did I mention that every time you steal spells, you have to redo your guardian force window all over again?
All in all, this game is absolutely dismal.  It's one and only redeeming factor is it's graphics, which were, yes, truly incredible.  Unfortunately, it's basically like watching the Star Wars 1 of Final Fantasy.  Boring ....  It's a chore just to play it.",1.0

"My review simply is: DON'T BUY!  Not on the PC!
At least not until Eidos has issued a better patch to download on their website The present patch does not correct the fundamental problem:
An instant game termination as soon as it is  installed in the Autorun. The autorun works fine but the Setup doesn't and  the Play doesn't.
The game generates a Memory Page Fault exception and  thus is unacceptable as a Windows application.
There is no game to play  on the CD-ROM and until Eidos have corrected that it is a waste of  money.

"I like RPGs but this is just horrible. Final Fantasy 8 is probably the worst RPG game ever made. The battle system is horrible, the characters are very boring and annoying (especially Squall), and the enemies are too powerful for your weak characters. Whoever thought of this inexcusable junction battle system should be fired. The monsters and bosses level up as your characters which makes leveling up totally useless. The bosses have way too much HP and you have to worry about your GFs leveling up. Basically you just enter the battle and summon your GFs to death.
To top it all off you have to watch the GF intros over and over. It gets very annoying after a while. Another thing, there is no real ""bad guy"" in this poor excuse for a game. What's all of that work for? A BIG fat nothing. The only thing that's impressive about this game is the graphics. That's that. Even that doesn't save it. FF8 is lame, repetitive, and just plain horrible. Avoid this one.

"This is, in my opinion, the worst Final Fantasy game ever. First of all, the plot does not develop at all throughout the game, & seems rather static until near the very end. And then even around the end of the game, where usually the story takes a huge turn for the worse through some sort of a shocking revelation (apparent throughout most of the FF series), this situation is just dumb, & the plan for resolution seems to be pulled out of nowhere at the end. As for the junction system, this system is [poo]& requires you to play through many redundant battles just to try to get some spells to use on the higher creatures. The push-button critical attack is also frustrating, taking some near hours to master a certain characters timing correctly. If you want a good FF game, go get FFVII, or play through the Anthology series.",1.0

"This is a example of how far video games have regressed over the past five years.
The hype machine behind this game rivaled that of Star Wars Episode 1: the Phanton Menace. They both had a brand that was a household name. They both had incredible special effects. They both were hyped for months. They both...sucked.
Remove the incredible graphics and CGI sequences and you will end up with a game with annoying, irritating, angst riddened characters, a head lulling storyline, a flawed, confusing, and frustrating Draw & Junction system, and none of the charm that made the SNES Final Fantasy games good. Furthermore, as awe-inspiring as the graphics are, even that hampers the gameplay. There are times where the graphics are so overly detailed that you can't tell where you are or where to go without a little Mickey Mouse hand to point to all the exits. I have never felt so cheated in all my life when I played this game. It's so sad that games like this, with all graphics and no gameplay, are considered the norm in video games. Years ago, you didn't have Spielberg budget graphics to hide behind. Your game had to be a fun, addictive game, or it's trash! Nowadays, your game could be so horrible to the point where it's debatable to even call it a game...but if it's pretty enough, it will get accolades galore.

"Good gravy... This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life. Not that the game was even that bad, but... It never lived up to its own hype. I have played all of the Final Fantasy games... Since I beat the very first game, I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic. I cherished IV, and I absolutely LOVE VI, which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music. And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind... The Final Fantasy... In a whole different perspective, with three dimensions on the battlefield. When FFVIII came out, I already had a copy reserved... I held the glowing package in my hands, looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics, and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to. But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII... There was a voice screaming in my head... My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden... And then my friend said that very thought: ""Jay, this game sucks."" Yes, it does. This game is a disgrace to the series. A storyline that is so slow, so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences? There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme! The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score. There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey. The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies. The character development was never there. Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk. ...Or WHY the GFs (Ha, ha) erased the memories of the characters. The lead character, Squall, answered every single question with the word ""whatever."" Compare that to the strong-willed, heartbroken Cloud from FFVII, and it becomes obvious. Allow me to say one more thing: Final Fantasy VI gripped me. I captivated me with a spell that bound me. I played, played, and played that silly game, with it's cute 16 bit graphics, as if I were possessed. The same goes for VII. I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment. I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII, and never gave it a second glance. Only a year later, after exams were done in college, with no car or friends around... Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance. How sad. The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Cloud's arms... But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII, I know that I wanted to just bawl.",1.0

"I bought Nocturne on a whim because it had a slick, appealing package and a few credible blurbs from known reviewers.  However, from the amateurish and cheesy opening movie, I fought myself to find something likeable about  the game.  No luck.  I have a fast and vast machine, but this game made me  feel like I owned a 486.  The load times were excrutiating even after  non-events, and unbearable between major scenes and after a character  death.  I could overlook the poor cuts during combat and carry on with the  action if all else was smooth, but watching the lead character move around  while travelling through town (or elsewhere) was like watching someone with  diaper rash trying to transport a roll of sand paper between his/her legs.  Realistic movement?  Maybe if you fight bad guys with a load in your  britches.  I wanted to like this game, I swear I did.  I went in with the  attitude that a few technical glitches could be outweighed by a creepy,  intriguing storyline.  Nope.  Other than the throwback setting and mediocre  historical background, nothing came across as particularly original or  scary.  I wish I could say something nice, but I honestly cannot.  The dark  color scheme and fog was neat, but just not enough.  As a veteran gamer  from the days of text-based Zork through Resident Evil and beyond, I want  nothing more than to play a game that tests your imagination and your  dexterity, not merely your patience.

I consider Nocturne a huge waste of my money and time (despite the fact i only spent a couple hours playing before i  uninstalled, it was time i could have spent watching my dishes dry...boring  yes but at least not frustrating!).
Despite gorgeous graphics (well, i  guess...my computer isn't quite up to spec), the problem here is that instead  of a first person view, it is 3rd person movie-style.  This means that at  no point can you actually see what's in front of you!  If you're in the  front of the screen, you have no idea what's around you...if in the back  you cant see anything.  Also, that means that if your character is facing  you, you have to move him like you would a mirror image, but if he's facing  away you have to move opposite! Forget trying to do any quick combat  moves...I'm spinning around like a top in parts of the screen I cant even  see.

"Could have been a lot better. to put it simply, to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan ever,me, i was totally diappointed by this game. i hate the whole modern/futuristic look that this game has. even ff7 had this to a point. i want this to be like fantasy..castles, swords, mages, kings, knights, wizards. i hate that there is no armor or accessories, plus i hate that there are no magic points, and magic is not earned. the experience points thing stinks. leveling up/money mean nothin in this game.  my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies.  ergo my sabin, celes, edgar, and terra army from ff3/6.  in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up.  this game is soooo dumbed down.  the villain or lack thereof is horrible.  BRING BACK KEFKA!  the gf's take like 20 years to finish making battles so annoying, instead of fun like in ff6 and chrono cross.  the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking.  plus every character is essentially the same, each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks. maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy 8 i woulnt have been disappointed. this remains the only ff game ever that i haven't finished, i stopped playing on disc 3. if u want a good RPG to play, get FF9 which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great. also i recommend ff3/6 which is undoubtable the best FF game ever, and arguably the best game ever. i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games.  don't waste your time or money with final fantasy 8.",1.0

The character and storyline are the worst i've ever seen. Squall is a horrible lead character, his compatriots are pointless and whiny, and the enemy is horrible as well. The music, which is usually four star quality for final fantasy games, was horrible. What happened to materia? The draw system is horrible and the GF system is really bad as well.

Even after beating the game I was left wondering ...WHY???. Unlike the other Final Fantasy's there was no definate villian, no real hero (squall was quite abusive to the heroine) and no real challenge. Just as seven the hardest boss was an optional boss that you could pick not to fight and get the same ending.

"Before you get all jumpy about the Five Star Reviews for this game, read this.  I've been playing Final Fantasy games since 2 on the Super Nintendo (4 in Japan).  At this point, I've beaten IV-IX...Some of them up to 3 times.  Anyways, my point is don't buy this game.  If you play all the other Final Fantasies with their memorable soundtracks, developed characters, unforgettable plotlines, etc and then play this, you'll wonder what you just payed for.  The only thing this game has going for it are the graphics and pointless cinemas.  This was one of those games where I would ""pretend"" that something good was going to happen..You know to make me feel like the game was worth playing.  Nope.  The characters are insanely dull and just can't make up their mind.  One second Squall hates Rinoa and the next he ""wants to be with her the rest of his life"" and all that garbage.  Love story..yeah right.  The soundtrack is nothing that you'll remember like the other games and the plot is just so...confusing?  I still have NO IDEA what is going on in the last cinema.  I mean the game just jumps to places with no explanation or reason.  One second I'm protecting this fisherman's town, the next I'm in space and then I'm going to the future.  That's another thing I don't understand.  How will killing Ultimecia in the future affect the present?  More horrible storyline I guess.  Also, Ultimecia just comes out of nowhere.  She is the ""third mage"" who comes out of nowhere.  She says like 4 lines in the whole game and really isn't evil or spooky.  Like when I played FF VI and Kefka poisoned the Kingdom of Doma...that was a true act of evil among many.  Also, when Sephiroth killed Aeris in FF VII, I at least felt like she needed to be avenged.

"This game is a disgrace to the Final Fantasy series.  It is way off par from what I have come to expect from Squaresoft.  What's so bad about it? Let me explain...
First of all, look at the title, ""Final Fantasy"". There is nothing fantasy-like in this game.  It's way too futuristic.  This cheapens it.  One of the things I have cherished about the Final Fantasy games is the quirky character design and plots, this game has neither.  Rather it has incredibly life-like characters and a stupid plot. Strike One
The Battle System.  It is horrendous.  Why?  It is incredibly complicated.  I like complicated things, but not to this extent.  I want a battle system that takes skill, but not one that you have to spend 15+ minutes tweaking your characters.  You will often fight bosses over and over until you have tweaked your characters to just the right degree.  The ""junction"" system is incredibly boring.  Strike Two
Finally, I just didn't ""connect"" with this game.  The plot wasn't much and the characters were nothing special either.  I didn't hate the villian, and I just didn't get that feeling of sensation when playing the other games in this series. Strike three, your out.

It was that common error where the computer said that the game disc was not in and I tried every thing I knew to do, downloading it even, which I never do any more, but even with the no cd hack and such still didn't work so just gave up on it but hey can say I have the game right? haha Well a short moment of glory.

"Don't buy this product. It's not even worth the money. First off, I wouldn't even say 'what you pay for is what you get.' This product is not worth the money. Second, after thirty minutes of playing it, the buttons weren't responding right. I'd have to slam my foot on the pad for goodness sake and that's ruining the pad! Third, some of the buttons do not operate right. For instance, I pressed the right arrow and it said on the screen that I pressed the up arrow. Also, my shoe size is eight and my feet barely fit without pressing a button. The buttons are too big and too far apart. Any movement triggers a button.

"I've been playing this game since it came out in 2000.  The game really is a lot of fun, and somewhat addictive, and it has great replayability.  That said, the online experience has gotten sufficiently bad that I'm giving it up.  I'm writing this review to warn prospective customers NOT to waste their money on this game.

The problems with internet D2 play are twofold.  First, there's a lot of lag since the most recent patch came out.  I mean -- a LOT of lag.  It's serverside.  Apparently Blizzard decided to economize on the support for D2, because it does not provide a monthly revenue stream the way WoW does.  It's not clear how they did this, but a good guess would be that they set up a scheme that allows servers to steal cycles from individual games in order to run more games on each server.  Whatever the mechanism, the result is that there are constant ""lag spikes"" running through games, sometimes causing play to freeze for as much as 15 or 20 seconds.  It's not fun.  The long lag spikes often cause player death, and the short ones are so numerous that some player activities (like ""teleporting"" by sorceresses) can be annoyingly jerky, with the character sometimes appearing to cast the teleport skill repeatedly without moving at all.  It's now quite common for a player to have to press a skill button twice to get the selected skill to change, or to have to click on an  NPC in town two or three times to interact.  Very frustrating, and no probability Blizzard will fix the problem.  After all, as mentioned, D2 provides no revenue stream.

The second problem is hacks, cheating, and ""botting"" by unscrupulous players.  Despite assurances from Blizzard that online play on ""the realms"" is ""secure"", hacks and cheats are endemic.  Blizzard's response has been at best ineffectual.  They have finally settled on an ""anti-bot"" strategy that relies on the simple expedient of penalizing everyone.  For example, it's now inevitable that a player repeatedly creating two-minute games to do magic-find runs will at some point receive a temporary ban from online play that lasts for one to several hours.  More severe violations, like making successive games less than a minute apart , result in punishment much faster.  This means that if you create a game, and it's a really horrible lagfest where your character can hardly move and you don't dare leave town, you're stuck with the game for three full minutes.  As like as not, ditching the laggy game within the first minute to try creating a new one will get you banned for an hour.  And if your game dies, as happens all too often in the new battle.net, you'll be treated to both a rollback that loses some of your experience AND a stint in the ""penalty box"" where you won't be able to create games for as much as an hour.

Sound like fun to you?  Didn't think so.  Despite the enjoyment I've gotten from this game, my advice to you is to avoid it unless you have a sky-high tolerance for frustration.",1.0
"Oh my god! this gfame is so boring. This game is so predictable. I played it for 12 hours (not strait) and got so bored I wanted to play Super Troll Island! The graphics are okay, the enemy has no tactics except for swarm and die,the music is kool but not worth the gamplay. Dont get this game unless you are a hardcore gore lover, like cheesey graphics, or love rpgs to the point where you rename yourself after your favorite charactor.",1.0
"wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a ""clicker"" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves",1.0
"I really did not like this game. First of all, the fact that you HAVE to do every single quest and there is only about 20 quests makes the game very narrow. After playing any of the Fallouts and any of the Baldur's Gates game, you can see how pathetic Diablo quests are.  Once I beat this game, i tried to replay it. It was so monotonous i could not finish it. The redundancy of only having a certain amount of quests and the utter fact that its just a repeat of itself is totally boring.  When i played, Battle Net for Diablo 2 was so overloaded even though I had DSL, i lagged a lot. I tried the expansion which was fun....for a week, b4 it got so boring i had to admit i wasted another $30. From now on im sticking to Interplay and Black Isle games.
Im a heavy RPG'er and I say buy Baldur's Gate 2, for it is infinately better.",1.0
"If you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game, cause thats all it is, clicking annoying flying/popping graphics off your screen.",1.0
"In psychology there is a concept called ""variable reinforcement schedule"".  Basically, if you reward a rat for pressing a bar, say with a food pellet, he will want to press the bar.  BUT, if you only reinforce the rat randomly as he pushes the bar, well, he'll push furiously, neglecting socializing, hygiene, and all else.  Diablo 2 works exactly like the latter situation.  You kill a baddie.  Did he drop something good?  Maybe, maybe not.  Every random time a baddie does drop something good, it inflames your brain to want to repeat that behavior, just like a slot machine, or a rat pressing a bar.  The priciple is PROVEN to be elegantly addicting.  In one sense, that makes this an incredibly efficient game, based on sound scientific data, with a vicious hook.  On the other hand, I could put you in a cage with an IV of endorphins that randomly activated occasionaly after you pressed a bar, and you'd all be giving it 5 star reviews on amazon and wasting your time playing it.  Here's an idea: spend time with your loved ones, read a book, draw a picture.  Life is short.",1.0
"At first, I thought this game was good. The graphics are not very visually pleasing but the lighting affects were very nice. There were several different characters each with their own abilities and such. But with each waking moment I grew more and more bored, and my mouse grew more and more worn out as all I basically had to do was point at something and click like crazy till it was dead, not very entertaining. To add insult to injury, the monsters I was encountering were pretty much the same old beasts with a new outfit on, and maybe a different attack or special ability.
Sure, there are tons of collectable items, and Blizzard claims that the items you wear change your appearance (A half-truth as boots, gloves, and jewelry do not show up on your character). But you can only do the same thing over and over so much. The game's ""quests"" from what I've encountered are basically you go here, kill this boss and come back. Sure, there may be a few things you need to do, like a grab an item from point a, an item from point b, and put them in point c; but the basic premise still stands.
The game has it's merits, they did spend a great deal of time making the full motion video cut scenes beautiful (ala SquareSoft), and there are alot of items, and the areas are fairly sizable, and the load times are next to nil (since the entire game is on your hard drive instead of on the cd like diablo 1).
The install process is slow and requires you to swap several disks including one with large movies on it (you should have the option of not viewing movies in any game). But the uninstall takes mere seconds. Which leads me to believe the game doesn't get fully uninstalled. I also hear the multiplayer is very fun (which can make the worst games great).
What honestly kills the game in my opinion? The constant need to click the mouse in a rapid fasion (the alternative is to hold the button down, which is just as bad), and the repetitiveness (which is also a major flaw in Phantasy Star Online).
If mindless clicking is your cup of tea, then by all means pick up a copy today. But otherwise save your cash.",1.0
"It IS point and click!  Yeah, the greatest RPG of all time!  It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG.  All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing.  They are all now one with the chair that they sit in.  Greatest RPG?  Not even close.  Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now.  I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.  The only thing that moves is the hand, making quick, convulsive movements.  I say that even if it does expand your brain (Ha, ha), the other negative effects far outweigh the good.",1.0
"Point, click, point, click, point, click.  Need I say more?  Incase you missed that it was point, click, repeat.  THIS GAME SUCKS!  I doubt the expansion will be any better.  I guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then it's sorta fun, but where's the challenge?  It took me ten minutes to master this game!  I cannot say enough bad things about this waste of money.",1.0
"Blizzard has fundamentally ruined the playability of the original Diablo by removing your ability/responsibility to regularly, explicitly Save your game.
In the original Diablo, if you didn't explicitly Save your game at frequent intervals, you faced the likelihood of *real* loss (of time, accumulated treasure, attributes, etc.) if you were unexpectly killed.  In the original, once you were under attack the attack was often so fierce that it was too late to Save -- you were dead before you could complete a Save.  And, even if you did Save at that point, when you resumed play you resumed right back in the heat of battle and, appropriately, were likely to be slaughtered within a heartbeat.  In other words, you faced something akin to real death when exploring the dungeon and that produced an element of real fear.
In Diablo II, your game is continuously, automatically ""Saved"" for you.  You can get out of ANY difficult situation by summarily quitting play -- when you resume play you'll find yourself automagically back at your safe ""base camp"" with your character, and all accumulated treasure, inexpicably intact.  The authors don't try to ""explain"" this bit of absurdity -- probably because they know they can't.
The problem is made even worse by the fact that the monsters -- at least in the first 3 quests, which is as far as I've gone so far -- are hopelessly outclased by your character from the get-go.  In my first eight hours of play I haven't come close to dying once -- and, believe me, I've tried (anything to relieve the boredom).
I LOVED the original Diablo and I expected to love this sequel. I don't feel good panning this game but I'm SO disappointed.  I expected to see more detailed graphics and plot (quests), but with the fundamentals of play preserved.  Instead, graphics and game plot appear unimproved and game play has been absolutely butchered. ...",1.0

"description says works on PS1 and PS2. Product failed to work on my PS2, tried many games. ordered another through another vendor that worked great. only paid about 12 bucks so I didn't even ask for a return/refund.",1.0
the controller did not work. i contacted the seller and he said to return it for a refund. i never got the refund. he ripped me off. i do not know what to do to recover my money,1.0
"It appears to be the original product that sony has, however once it arrives to your home and after you unpackage the product, you will find an unpleasent surprise. The controller is a cheap knockoff, an imitation and the picture is a phony and a fake. Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1.0
"What I got is nothing like what is pictured. All i was looking for, was an original PS1 Dual Shock controller. The simple gray one from when Playstations were first released. What I got was some poorly developed/designed third-party controller. Not the least bit ergonomic in anyway and to top it all off, it is completely useless in that the controller does not even fit in the port. It's too big for it so don't let the price fool you, they get you with $9.99 for shipping. So even for 1, I am sorely disappointed.",1.0
Fun game but it didn't save it said it saved but it actually didn't,1.0
"Thanks to Nintendo's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems, we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there.  True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.  Complete waste of money.  I do not recomend.  Let's hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trash.",1.0
This is argubaly the worst system EVER. The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation. There are no good RPG games for  this system. The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system. The best game it had was Goldeneye 007 and in my  mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the  entire system during its 4 years on the American Market.,1.0
Controller was broken middle piece missing. Unable to play the game without it. Will be returning,1.0
"If I could leave 0 stars I would- product does not work. Used different cords & tried different TVs and concluded it is the N64 that doesnt work.
Now to begin the long drug out return process. ",1.0
"I was so excited to surprise my girlfriend on our anniversary with a N64 and she was sooo excited when she received it! Unfortunately, whomever sent us a box with a dusty console and a couple of cords didn't exactly satisfy my needs. At least send a controller with your broken console! Dont worry, Ill pay the shipping for my major disappointment. I guess Ill buy a pack of MnMs for Valentines Day.",1.0
"Product didn't work. Arrived filthy and smelled horrible. Had to clean it before even taking it out of the box as I did not want to put it in my home in the current state. The restart button sticks. Item turned on but that was it, seller advises checks all products before selling. I think seller makes sure they turn on not that they actually play a game. Disappointed I wasted my money.",1.0
Doesn't work.,1.0
"The n64 doesnt turn on. Im still trying to figure out if the issue is the n64 power cord or the n64 itself, but regardless its dead.",1.0
The system works but the controller does not. The joystick is broken,1.0

Very disappointed.  The console didn't come with any remotes or cords.  Bought it for my son for his birthday and he cant even play it until I order or find all the missing items.,1.0

"is the review writer ""Software User From Wisconsin""(the first review)being sarcastic? because the graphics are aweful, and don't get me started about bugs. they say that the dinosaurs came out of the movie, its ""the lost world"" not the spice girls music video.i don't know what  an AMD is so i cant talk about it. anyway, it sucked so don't buy it.",1.0
"This is not a game. It is manure masquerading as a game. Smelly manure.  I'm all for a ""sense of wonder"" but when that ""sense of wonder"" is bogged down by an insurmountable wall of bugs (bad bugs), an extremely clunky physics engine, non-existent gameplay, and a bunch of other gaffes who needs it?  This is an excellent box-stacking simulation but is nothing else",1.0
"I love Star Trek, so all movies, games, and books I can afford and get my hands on I buy.  This game is a real disappointment.  Don't bother buying it if you have any kind of an up-to-date computer, it won't run on XP Pro.  I did get it to run on Win2000, only to discover it wasn't worth the effort.",1.0
"My God, if this is a game, it needs to be called Destruction Derby because of all the crashes.  My computer is WAAAAAAAAY above minimun specs for this game, and I experience crash after crash.  The fact that there is no in game save option really [stinks] also because you have to start the mission over after your game crashes.  The only reason this game got a star was because the graphics and movies are cool, but as far as game play and interface.... it [stinks].  The game isn't hard, it's just time consuming, and gets really frustrating when you have to restart you computer every half an hour or so because of the crashes.  Don't ask interplay if you there will be a patch out soon either, they won't respond, lately they have just been shoving games out on the market half finished and then not providing help to the customers who bought the games.  I know I'm not the only person experiencing these problems because I bought the game with three other people and they have them also, and feel the same as I do.  Quite frankly this is the last game I will ever purchase from them.",1.0
"I just got mine from here ant it doesn't even turn on, the power adapter won't click in and the console has no power. I want this fixed and I've already sent a complaint to the company that sold me the defective device. I paid so much money for this and it doesn't even work. Not a good purchase.",1.0
Doesn't work sent it back twice.,1.0
DID NOT WORK SCAM.,1.0
"It was below my expectations. When I received it, one of it's corners was broken. On top of that the controller analog was really lose. I give it a 1 star rating.",1.0
Terrible!,1.0
Really disappointed with this purchase. I received this system with the controller missing and the console didn't work.,1.0
This was great until it stopped working after two or three uses.,1.0
I bought this for my husband in October for Christmas. I had not opened it because i would know how to hook it up. It was absolutely gross with dirt and it didn't work. I tried to contact the seller and because it was past 30 days i got no response. You are better off going on 5mile or offer up.,1.0
It was dirty and all nessacary cords were missing,1.0
Misleading.,1.0
My son opened to consul this morning for Christmas and it does not work.  Furthermore the controller appears to be broken.,1.0
Received without cords and controller and now I find out its a Japanese version and can't play American games,1.0
"I don't know if it was specifically stated, but the game system came without a cord. What good is that?",1.0
Why the hell did this come with no chords or controller as in picture? I read the discription before I purchased and all it was was a history on Nintendo. I don't care about that I wanted to play my games and now I can't and have to spend extra money to get everything else... thanks for ruining xmas!,1.0
System works but why advertise that it came with a controller if it does not. It's misleading and I would like a refund I do not want this product anymore.,1.0
Did not work. Not as described,1.0
Came with absolutely nothing!! Had to turn around and buy the power and av cords. Glad I bought a controller!,1.0
"I really anticipated the release of this game, as all Gaming Magazines had rated this game off the charts!  After purchasing the game, I went through the tutorials, and read the entire instruction booklet.  I found the ship  relatively easy to control, and figured out all of the controls fairly  easily.  The graphics were spectacular!  What I didn't like was the  boring game play, and graphics glitches, ie. Flying right into a  planetkiller, and no damage to your ship.  The gameplay was boring because  of an excessive lack of a GOOD storyline.  Whoopee, Decker's on the loose.  That was about it.  They could have made the mission briefings 10x better.  There basically was none.  How about having the capability to go to warp  speed.  INTERPLAY-  TRY COMBINING AN RPG, AND A COMBAT SIM WITH A GOOD  STORYLINE AND THE SAME GRAPHICS QUALITY FROM THIS GAME.  IT WOULD BE HUGE!  Also, I felt there was absolutely ZERO replayability.  Overall, I give it a  one.",1.0
Sent item with busted cords does not work!!!!!!! Super disappointed being that it was a gift!!! Would give zero stars if I could!,1.0
Came broken not working at all.,1.0
Lame s*** had me excited for nothing,1.0
"Did not come with controller. Could not just plug in and play. It didn't come with games or anything but the console. Was expecting a controller, now my gift is ruined until I can get controllers in. Even my rumble pack is here. What happened guys?? Also this console is filthy. Covered in dirt, I can't even try to see if it works with no controller.",1.0
Console did not work my uncle ws able to fix it ..did not want to deal with the hassle of sending it back,1.0
System was beat up,1.0
"DON'T BUY.  WILL SEND YOU HALF A SYSTEM.  DOESN'T DO MUCH GOOD WITHOUT A POWER CORD, DOES IT?!?!?!?!?",1.0
Console doesn't work,1.0
The controller's Z button does not work and I ended up having to purchase another AV cable as the one supplied did not work.,1.0
It's neglecting to mention it's only the box no wires or controllers they need more details I'm disappointed.,1.0
"Ordered this, thought it came as pictures (aka...with power and AVC cables...) it didn't. Literally just the Nintendo. Would have been nice to at least have a warning/somewhere stating that all I would be getting is the console.",1.0
"No power cable, audio video cable, or controller; also found a big hole in the side of the box.",1.0
"Going to have to return. Fourth controller spot came looking like a bite was taken out of it. not even sure how this could have happened. Looks like its been chewed on. pieces of the plastic i guess from that are rattling around inside the console.
It came fast but im extremely disappointed. Took to a video game store with working AV cables and they checked for me-- entire console is broken.",1.0
"Although I am very thankful for the console, I was VERY disappointed when I opened my package to ONLY find the console. I was expecting at least the power cord to be with this item and it was not. It also pictures a controller which was also not included. While I was more okay with that because I have been able to find various controllers for cheep. I was just not expecting to have to also purchase other items for this to work. Very upset about this. Better off buying the whole package deal for $90 because in the end that is how much this has added too. Not to mention I have had to pay shipping for each item. Not worth the time.",1.0
Wow,1.0
Did not stated console only,1.0
It did not work when i tried it.,1.0
I received the console in a plastic bag with thin layer of bubble wrap. This is no way to ship something this delicate. There are broken pieces of plastic rattling around inside the package and inside the console itself. No sense in even trying to see if it works. Returning asap,1.0
"I haven't checked to see if it works yet, but it DOES NOT COME WITH THE CONTROLLER as pictured or with ANY OF THE WIRES. Not quite sure how I am supposed to use it without the necessary wires. It is missing a lot of the necessary pieces. SHADY AS S***.",1.0
Probably my worst Amazon purchase ever. Came all scratched up with NO wires and NO cords. That may be something you'd want to mention in the description. What a sham. If I spent more I'd find out who sold it and destroy them.,1.0
"Doesn't work. Gets power, hooked it up to both tvs trying  it out. Made all the connections properly, plus adjusting the source mode on the tv.
Got NOTHING.",1.0
Console was not new as description said. Controllers are new but not Nintendo brand. Do not buy.,1.0
It took me a while to get all the cables ready for it because it wasn't an American model it was a Japanese model and by the time I had wires to test it it didn't work and I was a few days over the month return policy.,1.0
Console looks and works great! But!! There are no details saying it's just the console and no power cord or AV cables. It came in a box with just the console.,1.0
"CONSOLE DID NOT WORK.  I tested the system and accessories (controller, adapter, etc) with a system that did work so I know for a fact that the console was shipped to me broken.",1.0
Did not work.,1.0

It came with The console only.... Not cords or controller at all despite the fact that other picture even shows a controller.",1.0
"I receive my item today only to find out it was broken on the top area near the memory card. I am extremely annoyed at the fact that I paid for what's on the picture only to get a broken merchandise. Next time, make sure you put the merchandise separate from the cords and put more cushion on it!",1.0
I bought this n64 console to surprise my wife on Christmas. She was absolutely delighted. She went to hook it up but from the first use it took many attempts to get it to turn on. After that it would work for a little while then shut off. I tried replacing the power supply and AV hook ups but the issue was with the n64 itself. Now the console won't turn on at all. Out $50 plus it ruined her Christmas. Tried contacting the seller but they never reply.,1.0
"Pretty disappointed, both the power and reset buttons stick. The thing looks like it went to Vietnam. Won't be ordering anything from this supplier again",1.0
"Let me try this for the third time...
System was not in good condition, but very poor condition, and did not come with any of the cords even though the description plainly stated that the system would include ""all the hookups.""  I'm very disappointed but as it is a birthday gift, I do not have enough time to return it.  I am very disappointed.",1.0
This system was supposed to be a Christmas gift. It came and it doesn't work. I have tried hooking it up to two different TVs and nothing. I even tried calling Nintendo support. The light turns on but it looks like there is a problem with the AV port. I needed it for Christmas and now it's ruined. Thanks. Buyer beware.,1.0
"Ordered didn't work,sounded like stuff loose,power button hard, totally disappointed,  never ever had a bad experience, but never again will I or family buy from amazon again. Also descriptions said purple pack but was original red. Then tray where cartridge goes had dirt and food crumbs. Look like someone had written on it with crayon, has small marks,",1.0
System doesn't work at all. Really sucks cause this is all my wife wanted for Christmas and now no matter if they refund or exchange she will not get a present. On top of I had to order all the cables and a controller seeing as the pic is deceitful,1.0
"I want to say that I do think I got ripped of because where you put the Bundle Thingy was broken and i tried hooking it up to my tv trying 700 cords trying different games, reseting constantly, until I finally gave up... RIP My dreams of playing a nintendo 64. Hope you guys got to play.

"Don't buy this game unless you're an abxolute drip! This game is so boring and stupid, I hate it and never play it anymore and I can withstand a lot of boring games but this one-the most fun on it was when I first played it and went around the place exploring.

"Please hear me out. Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating.

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.

I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.

Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.

For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.

Take off the rose tinted glasses people.",1.0
System was claimed to be tested and functional. However it was not after I received it. Clearly took some damage in its day. I had to take it apart and remove hair and do my own repair.,1.0

"Was not pleased with purchase, system does not work and I just want to get my money back. This is the first time I have had a problem when ordering anything from of amazon. Really don't want to give any stars but I guess I have to put at least 1 star to submit my review.",1.0

I emailed them and when they didn't respond I bought a 3rd party controller.  Then out of the blue I receive a replacement controller and an email concerning my low rating.

Here's their email:

""Hey bro,

I was just wondering if you got the replacement controller? Anyhow.. If you get a minute, we would really appreciate it if you could remove your original rating (3). I thought your first rating was honest and fair. We are at %88 currently and we are hoping to be in the %90's by the Holiday season.
Much thanks! Eli (Opal's Attic) ""

So after they sent me a broken item and I personally bought a replacement for something that should have been right from the start they have the nerve to ask me to raise my rating.  Yeah ok...no BRO!",1.0
The antiquated game engine and poor targeting functions alone should be enough to make most gamers avoid this sequel.  My one star rating is due to the few fleeting seconds of enjoyment I received while firing a sabot round  through an allied multiplayer opponent's tank.,1.0
Disaster,1.0
I own this game.  I have gotten a 5 star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you can't get your money back or build anything.  The people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away.  I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never ends.,1.0
Would not work. Broken plastic pieces inside console.,1.0
If you don't have this game don't buy it.  I bought it.  It's impossible to not go bank rupt.  Every time I tried to build a good tower I went bankrupt.  It's the most stressful most frusterating game I've ever played.  If you want to get a good game get Spider Man for Windows 95 + 98/2000.,1.0
"I have always been an avid Sim player - SimCity (the original one), SimPlanet, SimTown, SimAnt... I've played them all (some only in teaching my nephew the fine art of being a SimAddict).  This particular game was dull (there's so much stuff that could have been done with it - but wasn't).  You only get a single perspective of the building and the main challenge (rather easily mastered) is to manage elevator service.  I could think of a variety of perks that could have been put in to the building to make this game more interesting... but in the end you end up feeling like a slum-lord as you create this monster tower with no character to it.

"Ordered the n64 console from this seller said it was tested and works great got it In the mail and the front right side of the console had a very visible crack in it left side of the vents had a stick like piece broken off.
As far as it playing well it's plays not to good I go to play WWF no mercy and the game freezes up and skips makes sounds so I go buy another copy thinking it's the game tried that copy and still the same result it does it with wcw vs NWO revenge also. I emailed them and told them this and they said it must of gotten damaged during shipping. To me it looks like it was dropped some how. This was August of 2013. Been trying to use it like it is for a year but it Keeps getting worse. I just now ordered another n64 from another seller. Would not buy another video game console from them again. Not only did the seller lie about the condition of the N64 but put fake pic of the N64 console that showed it was in working condition which in fact wasn't in working condition. I wasted $50 plus shipping on this and all I got i was a hunk of crap. When buying a vintage video game console or even a new console from any seller on the Amazon market be carful if it's used ask for pics before buying. The worst part is this seller still could be on Amazon selling items it's a shame now I'm more carful what I buy and whom I buy it from.",1.0

"I bought a Nintendo 64 from this seller a year ago and it was the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent. When I turned the system on my television screen went black and nothing else happened. I have read similar reports that this has happened to several other people. If you do end up buying this product, remember that if it doesn't work you only have a month to return it. I didn't know this and I spent months switching out components, such as wires and games, and asking around on how to fix the system. Now I can't even get my money back. I was also led to believe that the system would come with cables but sadly only the broken N64 came. Very fast shipping though, which is good as long as you don't care about whether your console works or not.

"This game is in the trash.... Waste of money everything that came with this purchase was none functioning..seller sell out. I'm glad I was able to line your pocket for a brief moment, but keep your garbage in a can. I recommend you also keep your trash off this site..epic fail.",1.0
"it worked only once, don't buy anything from this seller. he said the system was proven to work but im sure he lied to just get rid of it. stay away and buy from someone else.",1.0
"I was really excited to order this. It was supposed to be a replacement deck as my old one stopped working. The ad said it was in collectable condition....wrong. It was so dirty when I took it from the box that I immediately started sneezing, and the reset button must have been really gunked up because it was stuck down. Then, I look in the box and there is a note Inside telling me that all parts were cleaned before shipping and the system was tested. That seemed odd because I was sent a filthy system. Not one to judge a book by its cover, I set it up and turn on super Mario 64 and am really excited.  The game turned on but could not recognize a controller that I know does work. After 3 controllers i am able to start the game...AND IT SHUTS ITSELF OFF! And it will not turn on again. I've changed the power cords and the av cords...nothing. I am very disappointed.",1.0
It came with nothing and was completely useless!! Getting my money back for sure. Would give it 0 stars if I could,1.0
"No, just no. Av cable didn't work, I never got a replacement, and it just looked crappy. I would not recommend this guy.",1.0
the console arrived quickly but the system did not work. It would power on but it wouldn't send signal to the tv. other than that the N64 was in beautiful condition.,1.0
"i ordered a n64 around march 2012. The shipping and everything was fine but when i got it, it turned on,but it didn't read the game so it didn't play it, so we cleaned the game...nothing,cleaned the system nothing, so i figured that it was time to inform the seller about this",1.0
"Really doesn't match up to my ps4 and gaming PC with newly installed graphics card. Graphics are lacking with the N64 as if it was some kind of 64 bit system, very pathetic. I would like to also point out that there are no USB ports! How am I supposed to play music on this ""system"" or charge my phone? Ridiculous. Also, where the bejesus is the HDMI output/input? Graphics are bad as it is, but no HDMI port? Unheard of. Did I mention no Ethernet hook up? Spent atleast a day and a half searching for one and to no avail. ""How am I supposed to play online multiplayer,"" I thought to myself silently. AHA! It must have a wireless connection! To my dismay, and after taking apart the entire system piece by piece, my hopes were again shattered as I realized that this ""system"" does not, in fact, have online capabilities. I was crushed.  All the talk of this ""elite"" system being the best ever is just simply nonsensical. I mean I can't even use it to watch Hulu.  You would think this system came out in the 90s, jeez.",1.0
"I bought this product a couple month prior to use as a birthday gift. My girl friend was so excited when she saw it. But I was unable to get it to work with any of the tv's we had, including one older model. I thought it may be due to compatibility issues, so I went to the goodwell and bought another older tv. The product would turn on but it still wouldn't work with the new tv. I tested the tv and it worked fine with other systems, and an antenna. So I contacted the seller. This is what I got in response

 ""Im really sorry that the item is not working out for you but i know that the system was working 100% fine before it was shipped to you if you woild have requested a refund i would have been able to possibly help you but unfortunately you are outside of the return policy at this time therefore i cant really help you out im so sorry for that ""

So I wrote him back explaining that it was a present and hadn't been used. I also asked for any advice in how to repair it if he would not take it back. I never received another response. Though I can see how it may have been damaged during shipping, due to the fact that it was sent wrapped in news paper in an old beat up shoe box taped together.

Personally I found that "" DawgFrankDizzl85"" was completely unprofessional, and would encourage others to look at other options prior to his equipment",1.0

"I made this purchase over a year ago, so I can't even tell you who ripped me off. I bought an N64 with the expansion pak so I could play Donkey Kong 64. Well, I finally got around to buying DK64 spring of 2013 and when I put the game in, it didn't work. I opened up the n64 and the guy just gave me the standard pak to play games in general. (This was included in every n64) I paid 25 extra dollars for no reason, now I have to go and spend more money just to justify my purchase. Make sure you don't get ripped off. Open up your n64 the day you get it and make sure you get what your suppose to. Or just buy the expansion pak separate to avoid this. The n64 itself was in pretty good shape, a few scruffs, but that's coming from a system that's almost 17 years old.",1.0
We bought it hooked it all up and it doesn't work. Can't decide if we r going to send it back or send it in for repairs,1.0
I would have given it a 5 if it had worked.  Heck I would have given it a 4 if it worked half the time.  Plugged it in and it wouldn't even start.,1.0
"this game is a real turkey.  1. the theme is goulish, almost disgusting; 2.  the pace is extremely slow; 3.  the player options are poor.  Also, it "" eats "" memory out of your computer.  I have nothing good to say about this game.",1.0
hate it wouldnt  work in my pc  never will i buy a pc on here again its sucks,1.0
It didn't even work when i got the 64. Every time I plugged up the 64 to the TV it would go blank. I don't know if it was the wires or the console its self but i expect the item to work if i'm buying it from someone i don't even know.,1.0

"This item arrived on time, and well packaged, but it was disgusting. It smelled like it had been stored in cat litter, and then when I got the rest of the accessories, the entire system did not work. I bought new cables, new controllers and different games. The item did not work. Guaranteed to work? It would be nice if the guarantee was checked before shipment...",1.0
"The description was a lie.  I paid more in shipping and handling plus returning it with proof of delivery so I'd be sure to get some money back than the cost of the game console.

Don't trust anybody unless you have verified proof that what they are selling is 100% in what they describe.  My grandson wanted this so bad for Xmas. He was so excited when it finally arrived.  We tried everything to get it to work.  He has a Wii and thought it would be fun to play the Nintendo 64.  He saw You tube videos of the games and wanted so badly to play with his dad but that game had stopped working.

"NES is the best ever, SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible.

The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day.",1.0
I did not like because it brought the cables and does not explain much product information I did not like the salesperson explains the detail of what sells,1.0
"Where do I start with the overall disappointment. Let's start with the packaging with something this big I expected it to be in a box, once receiving my envelope with rips and tears all over I was very irritated with the lack of care from the seller. Once opening the package I was at least relieved to see that all the contents were inside of it.  After getting the contents out and inspecting them I was wondering how I bought something ""like new"" with scratches, dents , and the controller has a very lose analogue stick. Once I power up the system it did work which is surprising with all of disappointment that was brought on before.",1.0
"I ordered this system for a particular game that I was having trouble finding. I found the game, and ordered the system.

The items that they said came with it did not come with it. The product description said console hookups and controllers. They sent just console. When I contacted them they said I was lying about it.,1.0
"Kind of disappointed.  The Nintendo itself is fine, but I chose this one because it came with a controller.  The controller was a generic piece of junk.  The wiring is bad so the game deck keeps saying the controller is not plugged in, and the plastic cap on the joystick keeps falling off.  And I have to mention that its shape isn't even close to an N64 controller.  Big, uncomfortable and bulky.  Thanks for nothing!",1.0
"I like adventure games, but I like them to follow some sort of logical  puzzle solving, so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators,  figure out how they think and figure the game out that way. These puzzles  are completely illogical, obviously designed to be frustrating, and keep  you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game.  Also,  although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d  game is quite a stretch by any definition. Even the 3d cut-scenes were  crappy, and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible.  Supposedly the game made ""game of the year"" in Europe, they must  be pretty hard up over there, now I know not to take that as a  commendation.",1.0
"I got a Nintendo64 when they first came out. Unlike this gold N64 this is not the true gold controler. When Nintendo lauched N64 in a few of them was the orginal gold controler.

"This game could have been really great - but Nova logic hasreally dropped the ball in a big way here.

(the diamond monster sound cards crash too).  there have been literally hundreds of posts on their web site begging for help and there has been _no_ response from tech suport for over a month now. go check their web site for yourself - it is very revealing...i strongly suggest you save your money until they fix this program.",1.0
"I think that it stinks. I have contacted support three times and they never get back to you. Also, the software keeps crashing and locking up my computer.

"The game was fun back in the day, but now-a-days novaworld doesnt give two @*#&s about their old games and just let them run wild; especially Delta Force 1, 2 and 3.

If you want to stay in the delta force series (fun) I'd suggest Black Hawk Down and/or Joint Operations - Typhoon Rising (basically Delta Force 5, but they changed the name).

Black Hawk Down is most similar to DF 1-3 and also has an expansion pack available called Team Sabre. Team Sabre opens up a whole new set of servers that are more focused on forest and urban playing and also unlocks 3 more guns (G36, psg-1 and G3). Lately BHD has been getting less and less Novaworld servers and there is talk stats will be shutting down completely  before 2008.

Joint Operations is an extreme makeover of the Team Sabre expansion. The maps are HUGE and nearly everything was made from scratch. Updated graphics, gun models, human models, vehicle models, not to mention drivable boats, helicopters, trucks, buggies, etc.

If your mind is still set on the terrain type of Delta Force 1,2 or 3... Novalogic also came out with Delta Force X-treme. Its the exact same game almost except with updated graphics and drivable vehicles.

Hope this helps... because throwing away money sucks.",1.0
"I bought this game at a fairly low price, and when I started playing, I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.

 The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.

 ""OK...,"" I said to myself. ""Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?"" So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).

 So, anyway, I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all. I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.

 Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game. Enough said",1.0
"Really. This game is not that good. The graphic are choppy, the gameplay gets kind of boring after about thirteen minutes, and its about the same as Rainbow Six or even the original Delta Force. So, don't waste money on this. Spend it on Land Warrior, or Soldier of fortune. Not this.",1.0
"Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck,boring gameplay(I usually like realistic military games), coudn't acess campaign, takes forever to install.

"Even with a Pentium3 800 and 160M RAM, the constant stuttering, crashes and overall poor graphics quality make this game extremely aggravating if you use a Voodoo 3 card. The nighttime missions are especially bad because the horrible night vision goggles make the problem a lot worse. The missions are much longer than in the first game, with no ability to save during the mission. The missions themselves are designed for arcade style action with very little practical stucture. Does anyone actually believe the real Delta force sends a single, poorly armed soldier with two or four completely incompetant teammates into highly sensitive battle situations against heavily armed enemy factions? I doubt it. I wish Novalogic would make a more realistic Delta force. This is the only shooter game series I've seen with an open environment and non-linear mission structure. It has the potential to be much better than it is. At least they improved the graphics and VD3 compatibility in the third one.",1.0
"Delta Force 2 has to be the WORST action game I have ever played. The game is terrible. The graphics are horrible, the enemy intelligence is not as great as everyone has made it out to be, and the overall gameplay is just  frustrating. You can't get your teammates to do anything. And the graphics  are so bad, that they make you sick. While there are interesting weapons to  pick from, the gameplay is so bad, that it will turn your attention away  from the things that are cool in the game, and point you in the direction  of complete confusion and frustration. While the terrorists are  ""semi-smart"", your teammates are dumb as rocks. Multi-player mode  is probably even more frustrating. There may be neat places to hide and  snipe from, but chances are, after you die, you are going to start out  again in the worst place ever (as soon as you start... people are already  firing at you!). In my opinion, multi-player mode would be better if  everyone only lived once... and then a new game started. Sorry Delta Force  fans... but the game is terrible. If you are looking for a good action game  where your teammates actually respond to you, and the graphics are great,  then take a look at Red Storm Entertainment's ROGUE SPEAR. I played Delta  Force 2 to see if it was ""better"" than ROGUE SPEAR, because that  is what I had heard. Now, I can't even figure out how they could even say  that Delta Force 2 was better than ROGUE SPEAR. Delta Force 2 was really  bad... it could have been done A LOT better.",1.0
"This wheel works very well, when it works. Installation was easy, and I was very happy with the wheel the first few times I used it. After that, my machine would not recognize the device.

"i wish i knew how these people with 266 machines are getting this hog to run well....i have a 300 with all the bells and whistles and FS2000 doesn't even get off the ground. the frame rate is a freakin' slide show. it takes  minutes at a time to load or change scenarios. putting a 166 as the minimum  requirement is blatant false advertising. but i'm sure it's a great sim.  someday i'll buy a 500 and check it out.until then i'll be satisfied with  98 and some of the excellent add ons available for it, or pro pilot 99  which has better atc than either game....",1.0
"On the back of the box, Microsoft says it needs a Pentium 166 with 500mb free disk space and a quad speed CD rom drive.  I have a pretty good system: Pentium 233MMX, 2 gig hard drive, fast CDROM and a 3d banshee card.  It was terrible! The typical install took over 700 megabytes and there was  blood running out of the hard drive. It took about 40 minutes to install  the game and another 10 while it was building the scenery database. It also  took the hard drive 7 minutes to load the game and much more to change  aircraft. Because I had a 3d card, the actual perfomance was not too bad,  although the SLIGHTEST change made the hard drive go crazy!
I was very  disappointed. For those of you that may be considering buying this product  and have a 166 or a 233, STAY with FS98! I went back and I am pleased with  its performance! It may not have all the fancy features and scenery that  2000 has, but it is worth the tradeoff in performance.
I am very happy  using FS98. The third party utilities I downloaded made it almost as good  as FS2000, so if you're in my position..DON'T BUY IT! Buy FS98 instead, or  keep it if you have it.
You will spare yourself time, patience and money!",1.0
"Please read this review. Try to disregard the fanatical praises heaped on it by all the others that have succumbed to the rediculous amount of hype piled on the game. You'll thank me for it some day.
Ok, I'll admit i was  suckered into buying this game just because Bowie was in it. I am still,  however, a hardcore gamer. I've spent plenty of hours on Everquest, Tribes,  Quake 3, Starcraft and plenty of others. So I know a quality game when I  see one.

We'll start with graphics. First off, you need to be running  a very high end machine for this game to look decent. I'm running a  'pitiful' P2 450 w/ 256 megs RAM, and a Voodoo 3 2000, and I needed to set  the game to 800 x 600 with all the detail levels at medium for this game to  have a tolerable framerate. I can run Quake 3 at 1024 x 768 and almost  maximum settings, and its by far a much better looking game anyways.
And  this MUCH HYPED facial moting capture? Its AWESOME, BUT THE PEOPLE DONT  $#$%# BLINK!  Thus shatters the illusion of emotion, as all the characters  stare at you creepily like retarded zombies. Come on, how the heck did  Quantic Dream miss that? Plug in your old Nintendo and you'll see that even  the original Super mario Brother blinked! Cripes.
The setting is well  done, if not original. Sort of 5th Element meets Dune. The plot is obscure  at first and there's little to get you interested. it does get better, but  there's one main problem. . .
the play mechanics suck BIG TIME in all  modes of play!  This is typical of games that try to cover too many areas.  Rather than excell in one singular aspect (like Quake 3, Tribes or  EverQuest) it spreads itself very thin and comes out mediocre at best.
  the First Person shooting is choppy, the weapons are unispired and slow to  fire, enemies appear out of thin air (probably due to some bug) and you are  forced to rely too heavily on med-kits.
The fighting engine is also weak.  Its especially difficult to play with the mouse and keyboard combo, not to  mention the fact that its boring and usually fights are tossed in  hap-hazardly to culminate a first person shooting round. I would have  preferred that this was just left out and the FPS tweaked, but oh well,  what do I know, I'm just the consumer.
So with all this frustration, tis  a chore just to continue in the game. not to mention the fact that your  objective is very damn obscure at first and you'll spend most of your time  walking around aimlesly.
And then there were BUGS. And plenty of them.  Certain commands like walking or crouching don't work when applyed to  certain buttons. No particular reason it seems. For instance, I set walking  to left shift, as almost all FPS players will do, and I use the WSAD  running / strafing system. Forget it, cause that will cause a ton of  problems. Instead of using the up arrow when at the game menu, you need to  use the 'w' key because the game is too stupid to know when its playing and  when its not. You cant us the 's' key in your name if you've done this  either, because it takes you back to the menu. Sucks if your name is Scott.  There's plenty of other bugs too, but'll lets not spoil ALL the  surprises.
As for Bowie's 'gametrack', don't buy this game if you own his  new album, 'Hours. . ' because thats all it is. Really. he doesnt supply  the ambient sound as I had hoped he would, and the only time you get to  hear his songs is at a bar where some badly animated singer jerks around  like a puppet while Bowie's music is dubbed over. Sure the songs are great  but by the album, its cheaper. The ambient sound is still good, but it  skips, a LOT. So it gives you a headache most of the time.
As for the  game, if you want depth, by Everquest. if you don't like D&D go the  Final Fantasy 8 route. if you want shooting, by Quake 3 Arena or better yet  Tribes. If Omikron only runs half decent on your computer these games will  look amazing. if you want fighting buy Tekken 3 and see how it's SUPPOSED  to be done. Avoid this Eidos cash-machine like the plague.",1.0
"Only 1 star because I can't submit this without it!  I have a machine that is well over the minimum specs for this game, but I have had trouble running it sucessfully.

This game was a dude.  It did not work at all.  Could not get it downloaded.,1.0

The product was okay but it did not work on Windowa Vista,1.0
"This game is crap. I bought it after reading the wild praise lavished on it from all corners, and after weeks of playing it I decided that it's a vastly overrated waste of time. I even bought a strategy guide to understand what was behind it, but it left me with the impression that this game has very little depth to it.

People call this a strategy game. There's no strategy involved at all. It's simply a race to see who can amass the most technically advanced army first. Any tactics to reach that goal are very simplistic attempts to kill off enemy gold miners and lumberjacks. And  defence involves erecting walls around your town, or if you can bear the ingeniousness of it, by putting guard towers around your gold mines. All games play very much the same:

1)Put your villagers to work chopping wood and collecting berries

2)Once you reach the next age, build farms and make some soldiers. If you want to pretend there's skill involved, harrass the enemy villagers. Build some defensive walls. Continue making soldiers archers, and cavalry, and upgrade them. If you have allies research cartography and save yourslef a world of hassle.

3)Reach Castle Age and build a castle, with the ultimate goal of making some trebuchets in the next age. Slowly expand from your initial starting point by building some forward buildings, Keep hararssing enemy villagers if you want.

4)Once you reach the Imperial Age build trebuchets and troops to protect them. By this time you can afford almost all the upgrades available. The first person to achieve this situation has all but won the game. The trebuchets outrange almost anything and you can thus attack any building with relative impunity provided the trebuchets have enough guardians. For such a  powerful weapon they're vastly underpriced. Slowly pick off each enemy this way. Periodically check to see if your defence is okay. Apparently you can win by building a wonder or holding relics for 200 years, but it's far easier to achieve victory through miltary conquest, so these options are practically useless.

That's basically it. Come on, strategy? The most strategy I ever used was to build gates at river crossings, keeping the enemy out but allowing my units free access. That doesn't make me a military genius. What about morale, flanking bonuses, entrenchment bonuses, road travel bonuses? Cliff tops offer defence bonuses but relocating there isn't worth the time lost. Diplomacy is a farce. For 500 of each resource an AI opponent will join you. He'll be your bestest buddy if you feed him a 100 of whatever resource when he periodiclaly requests it. The you can happily build a castle and station troops in his territory, and when you feel like breaking the alliance, your troops act like Trojan horse and run riot in his town.

And it's abstracted almost to the point of silliness. A ""year"" goes by in 2 seconds. A farmer going from his field to the town center takes more than that. So over a year to walk from a farm to the town center. Units miraculously change into upgraded units in the blink of an eye.  And a group of villagers can actually destroy a stone guard tower. I thought the point of towers was to be defensive?

People often praise the rock-paper-scissors attributes of the units, but it only makes getting anywhere in this game frustrating. The most neophyte of gamers could build an army of pikemen to wipe out your army of knights, by taking advantage of the anti cavalry bonus of pikemen Does that make him a genius? The only solution is to build a balanced army. Thus all armies of all players wil tend to be very similar. Only the player with the biggest and best army will win the game.

And it's got ONE zoom level, and it's too close in. You can't figure out the ""bigger picture"" with one zoom level. Just as you're concentrating on your assault on the enemy town center, the enemy could be doing the same to you just off screen and you'd never even notice. There are alaam bells but you rapidly get overloaded with audio signals and they become meaningless.

Apparently it's better multi player, but if you want to put up with stuck up poseurs who continually denigrate people with ""noob"" jibes in all seriousness, be my guest.

The most commendable thing about this game is the manaual which is attractively presented and well written. I wish all manuals could be like that. And I could mention that it's actually quite fun for a few days before the awful truth dawns on you.

As for the ""commendable"" historical aspect, it just means that you can't use more tactically useful air units, pyschics or magic spells. The historical aspect only prohibits any strategy forming.

Don't be fooled by the hype. Age Of Empires 2 is a shallow RTS  that rapidly becomes formualaic. If you want an historical RTS with depth go for Sid Meier's Gettysburg, Caesar 3 or Medieval Total War, not on this rubbish.",1.0
"I bought this game because I really like the first one. This one doesn't compare. The maps are darker, the movement stilted and clumsy. There are some good additions to game play, but the scenes and population are inferior IN USE, if not to the eye. I was really disappointed.",1.0
"I don't hyave this game.  Then how could I write a review for it?  Because my younger has this game and he plays it quite a lot.  The pros? buildings look pretty good and ummmmmm oh yah there are a lot of units.  The cons?  Big one.  It seems that that this game was a rushed attempt by microsoft.  The game seems to be lacking so many things.  Also resource gathering tkes a realy long time.  This is a really bad thing since the only way to win in this game is to throw lots of units at your enemy.  You harvest 4 recources.  It takes a REALLY LONG TIME to get enough of any of the 4 recources. Also it seems like you have to constantly have to replant your farms. The game involves little or no strategy. This might have something to do with fact that all the 13 races are almost identical.  Each race has the same buildings, technologies to research, units, and tactics.  Upgrading gets repetitive and boring.  The graphics for the terrain are terrible.  There is a unit limit wich is annoyingly low.  Also age of empires has some of the most boring batles in any RTS game.  You spend more time on getting resources than attacking.  The sound effects are horrible and the game has NO music.  Also there are no air units.  Except for trees the terrain is not deformable.  It comes with tons of useless game modes.  If I couold give it -2 stars I would have.  This is a game for little kids.  There is so much micromaneging in everything.  The naval units are pathetic.
 In conclusion every element of gameplay you can imagine sound, graphics amount of strategy etc. is terrible.  This is a rushed atempt by microsoft to compete with the best games such as dark Reign and Red Alert 2.  I think that this is a disgrace to strategy games.  This is the most BORING AND PATHETIC STRATEGY GAME I have ever played.",1.0

The discs did not have the black on the back that is characteristic of all PS1 games. I put the disc in and it was never able to read.

"While the game is enjoyable as an adult... it has one serious problem for anyone easily offended or thinking about buying it for their kids.  Microsoft (who controls policy for game play) will not take any action on anything said via a private message to you from any player.  It may be death treaths, it may be racist hate speech, it may simply be harrassing messages of a violent sexual nature.  ""Nothing"" will be done to players sending these messages... it is their policy that anything sent via private messages is just that... private.  That being the case, I highly recommend choosing another game if you are easily offended or plan on letting your children watch and/or play.  The game is advertised as for ages 13+, however... due to the violent and graphic in nature messages you will recieve, the true age group is likely 21+.  I enjoy playing, but have quickly filled up my allowable list of players I can ""squelch"" so I won't have to listen to the profanity, threats, and general harrassment.",1.0

The game play is to easy and,all the servers are what some people called ""Tweaked"".Which means the whole point of the game can basically be given to you by someone else.

I  do not encourge buying this game....It is very time consuming and you will be glad to turn it off after your first month.",1.0
"Okay, here it is in a nutshell.  The graphics bite, and bite HARD.  The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable.  And there is little if any help by the  GMs.  My two cents.  Buy at your own risk.",1.0
"This is one of those games that you think is the greatest thing ever invented when you first load it up.  However, after a while, you will realize that this game is absolutely terrible.  THIS GAME IS 100% HACK AND SLASH!  The quests are no fun, since dozens of people are camping them.  Getting yourself equipped is no fun, since even more people camp the chests  and monsters with items (which are few).
Every place that is  interesting is crowded.  Sure, the world is huge.  But 95% of the world is  completely uninteresting, so everyone ends up in the few places that are  worth going to.  Then, your computer slows down from all the people, you  get portal stormed away, and you can't read your chat window because so  many people are talking.
You see all these reviews, raving about how  great the game is.  I was like that too.  But in a month or two, after you  have wasted all your time making a powerful character, you will ask  yourself, ""What now?""  The answer: quit; but you won't want to  because you spent so much time creating this powerful character with neat  weapons and armor.  The only thing you can do is get more and more  powerful, for no reason other than to get more and more powerful.
There  are no quests to save the world, no secret items to find, nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Asheron's Call is basically one big fancy chat room.  After you get bored killing the monsters (which are insanely easy to kill,  no monster needs more than one player to kill it), and you WILL get bored  killing monsters, since they provide little XP.  After about level 40 you  need 10,000,000 XP per level (and that rises exponentially).  But the most  XP you can get is 15,000 per kill, from monsters that are very rare (level  159 Tusker Guards, etc).  So think about it.  You are killing thousands of  monsters.  And they all do nothing but run directly towards you, so if  there is a wall you just shoot at it (you can shoot through the walls) as  it runs at the wall.  Fun fun fun.  After you get bored killing monsters,  then you go Player Killer and kill other players.  But you will find that  some loser has spent much more time endlessly killing monsters and is level  70.  So even though you are level 40, you will get murdered non  stop.  It's just no fun.  So it's a fancy chat room, with Quake 3 added in  (but not nearly as intense as Quake 3).
If you want to pay alot of money  for that, fine.  Online 3D MORPG gaming has not reached it's pinnacle yet.  Save your money, your time, and your pride.  Don't end up like me: looking  back at months of time completely thrown away.  I am ashamed and  humiliated.  Watching TV would have been more useful (and fun) than playing  Asheron's Call.
Also, there are no houses or insignia yet.  The designers  lied about that.  It is buggy and you will find yourself losing valuable  possessions due to lag bugs in the game, and if you lose things due to  THEIR bugs, they will NOT help you get anything back.  There also aren't  really any people coordinating the game.  Little kids run around swearing  at you and stealing all your stuff.  You can report them, but they must be  caught 3 times in a row (and they never get caught because they keep no log  of what people say, a sentinel must be there at the time of the incident,  which is rare) before they are suspended for a day.  You can guess how  effective those countermeasures are.
Positives: The graphics are great,  the world has no zones (except dungeons), and you can greatly customize the  look of your character to be unique.  This last thing is the best part of  the game.  The second best is the allegiance system, which is perhaps the  perfect solution to helping out newbies.  If only they took all the good  parts and made it into a memorable game.
Take it from an experienced  player, don't listen to people who just bought the game.",1.0
"This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame.",1.0
"I am unfamiliar with this relm of video game play so I believed that the animation would be as pictured on the inside cover and in the game preview.

"Microsoft, in their ""infinite wisdom"",has decided to warm over their FS98 version with this ""clunker"".

At least with FS98, you can load it and play it off your hard drive. Iv'e spent more time loading and, swapping cd's than I have playing FS2000. Nothing too ""whoopee"" about their so called improved graphics either. A few little ""frills"" here and, there. I'm sure MS is proud of the fact that to start the game you have to verify each time by loading the CD's, taking from 1 to 3 minutes.  ""bummer"".",1.0

Even when I fooled around with the settings I couldn't make the sim work as well as Flight Unlimited did on an old mac two years ago! This is a prime example of bigger not being better.

"This game is one of the saddest and most unetertaining titles to come out in long time. It just goes to show you how desperate some game companies are to develop anything when the right corporate sponsor comes along. I'm certain that the daily racing form is not only embarrased by this game, but wishes that their name was not associated with it.
Specific Flaws: Not enough horses, Only a few tracks that all run alike. Such limited control over horses that it's sad. Early speed wins almost every race. Engine is pathetic. Graphics are pathetic, you look like your riding the horse from the ambulance! Plus it's not full screen, heck it's not even a window. The simulation is even weaker that Hooves of Thunder.
If you want to feel the true sensation of Owning, Breeding, and especially Riding a horse then your only real optiion is to buy Gallop Racer from Tecmo! It is the only game that does the sport of kings true justice! If you don't own a playstation you can emulate one easily on a pc with Bleem (sold at amazon) or connectix virtual game station.
If you don't beleive me, go to the Tecmo website and check out the Gallop Racer Forum, you will see that with Gallop Racer the fun never ends.
I bought this piece of junk because I am a horseracing freak, but I was sadly dissapointed! Save your hard earned money and buy Gallop Racer. If you don't remeber I told you how it is!  This game gets one star because someone decided to try to come out with a pc jockey game, unfortunatley they failed badly!",1.0
"Despite how cool the actual sport is or how cool the idea sounds this game is HORRIBLE!  In my opinion Activision could not have done worse.

The  questions repeat themselves so often it is embarrassing and insulting to  the consumer.  They should have had at least 1000 questions available.  The  game repeated its first question after we had played three games.  Now  every question is a repeat and the CD might as well be a coaster for all  the good it is now!

The computer 'cheats' by having no  time restrictions on building fleets and refitting ships. But it takes you  hundreds of turns to just refit a single ship.

It was then  that Regis started calling us ""dummies"" as well as  ""pathetic"" and then shuts down the game!  Can you imagine the  reactions of these kids who already suffer from low self-esteem.

We had a lot of fun with this game...for the first hour.  Then, we started seeing the same questions over and over again.  By the time we had played for several hours, every question up through about the $32,000 level  was a ""repeat"".

"We installed and started up the game with much anticipation, having all been infected by the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire TV show bug.  The four of us crowded around the keyboard had a wonderful hour of fun answering questions, making fun of each other if we left with $0, and revelling in  the competition to get into the hotseat.  It was also a lot of fun laughing  at the customized Regis voiceovers after each game.
Unfortunately, the  glamour wore off quickly.  The questions presented started looking really  familiar the second time we sat down to play.  In fact, they were the same  questions.  If you look on the game box, you'll even see that it proclaims  ""Hundreds of brain-teasing questions.""  More like maybe just ONE  hundred?  Obviously the game was no longer fun with the same players after  a few rounds.  We haven't played it since.
If you want a great game for  one (but just one) party, this is a good game.  But don't buy it for retail  price.  Try to find a used one on an auction site somewhere.  In fact, if  you want my copy.  ""Come on, let's play, let's do it, here we go, let's play Who  Wants to Be a Millionaire!""",1.0

My  hope is that Disney will create an upgrade that meets what consumers expect  from a company like theirs.  For all the money Disney is making on this  network show being the number rated, they should upgrade this program and  make the upgrades available to all who purchased the current version.

"This is the most meager cash-in attempt I've ever seen. There may well be hundreds of questions, but it'll take you a thousand games to see them all. I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game, and a  majority of repeats by game 10. There seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty, which was proven when I saw a $500 question later  repeated as a $125,000 question later in the game.
An example of the  game's inadequacy runs thusly: I am cruising through the game easily until  the $32,000. Fine, by now I'm expecting them to be tough. I use the 50-50,  then the call a friend, who says she is 75% certain the answer is (A). Just  to be sure, I use the audience poll as well. Guess what, 92% say that (A)  is their choice. Well, now I'm convinced and go with (A) as well. I'm  WRONG, it's (B). That is just stupid beyond measure. If they wanted to  throw me off, make the audience rating more like 60-40% or  something.

Not worth the novelty of being the first in the  family with the game.",1.0
I gave this to my brother for his birthday and we were all very excited about playing....but within one nights play we had repeat questions. Sometimes as many as four times! Anyone that bought this first version should be entitled to FREE updates,1.0
"Recieved the game for xmas, at first it was a lot of fun, but then it was the same questions over and over, not much fun anymore, Im sure they could have done better, Don't buy!",1.0
"This game plays the same questions over and over.  After two games, we began getting repeats.  Surely the makers of this game could have added more questions?  I could have thought of more myself.  I felt bad that I  ordered it as a Christmas gift.  THIS GAME IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!",1.0
"I must say that yes, it was an OK game. I thought, ""Oh great! I liked the TV show so this must be as great as the TV show."" Let me point out the two main things that really bugged me (there are others but these were  the main two): -First of all, when u are playing the fastest finger  question and no one in the room gets it right, the game quits itself! Now,  I cheated one time by pressing my letter everytime an answer would come up.  THEY NEVER GAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER! -Second of all, if u are playing and lose  all of it (meaning ur back to zero), Regis comes on and is really rude! I  mean he practically insults u.
Now, take my advice and the others who  have bought the game, don't buy it. Buy some other trivia game, just not  THIS one!",1.0
"The game provided about one hour of continuous play before I started to see duplicate questions.  After two hours of play (maybe 15 games), 5-8 of the questions were duplicates.  I do not reccomend this game to anyone.",1.0

"VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I'VE PLAYED ""YOU DON'T KNOW JACK"" (FROM SAME COMPANY) FOR MONTHS WITHOUT GETTING A REPEAT QUESTION.  AFTER ONE NIGHT ALL OF THE FIRST 10 QUESTIONS WERE REPEATS.  THE MULTI PLAYER FUNCTION DID NOT WORK.  I KEPT HITTING VARIOUS LETTER KEYS FOR THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT IT DID  NOT REGISTER.  FINALLY AFTER MUCH PROMPTING FROM REGIS, HE JUST SHUTS DOWN  THE GAME WITH A RUDE REMARK. DID THEY EXPECT PEOPLE TO PLAY THIS GAME ONCE  OR TWICE?  VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.",1.0
"After working for Jellyvision and purchasing every single ""You Don't Know Jack Title"", I became accustomed to the high-impact multimedia designs created by Jellyvision in their games. You would think, in a  product marketed by BOTH Jellyvision and Disney Interactive, that there  could be more interactive elements, better questions, and a greater  similarity between the TV show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire""  and the CD-ROM game. For starters, the CD-ROM is missing many crucial  elements that would make it a success: 1. In every Jellyvision game,  narration between the host and the player takes place. ""WWTBAM""  leaves you to fend for yourself. Even when incorrect and the correct answer  is given, Regis does not explain why. 2. No video. Except for the opening  and closing video clips with Regis and his wad of cash, there is no  ""live"" video other than 3D transitions. 3. Sound. Sound could be  more consistent. With all levels at max on my mixer, voices were still  lower than music.
Obviously, the creators of this software were rushing  to market this product before the holidays came and it is clearly  evident.
This game and its concept are phenomenal, it just is lacking the  critical elements seen in other Jellyvision products.",1.0
"Please be aware that this game will only run on the lowest screen resolution, with 265 colors and 640X800 resolution.  If you have a new machine, it simply won't run.  I paid for it but can't use it.",1.0
"I have to admit that I never was a victim of the ""Tomb Raider Hype Machine"". I liked the idea of a 3rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the big-boobed Lara Croft just turned me off.  I bought this for 4 bucks at the used software house and played it for about 2 hours. I liked the save game feature somewhat, it should be more specific. I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the 50th time because I didn't hit the ""jump"" button in the right sequence with the ""run"" button at the correct prescribed time.  The interface is just too rigid for a game like this, it reminded me alot of that old ""Dragon's Lair"" game. And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles.  I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first non-adult game with a overly-endowed female protagonist. It can't be because of the gameplay.",1.0
"I am one of the biggest fans of Adventure Games there is, especially those by Lucas Arts (Monkey island, Sam and Max etc.) but this game lacked all  elements which i enjoy in a game.  I played it for half an hour and then  took it back because in that time I had experienced no conversation or  decent interaction of any kind.  All I was doing was walking around a  planet picking rocks up - hmmm, fun.",1.0
"This is a perfectly dreadful game. The characters are awful. I got to the point where I couldn't stand any of them. There are long sequences where you have no real choice but to listen to them make idle, idiotic  conversation. The game play was agonizingly slow and buggy. I played it out  but was deeply disappointed by the whole thing. Yuck!",1.0
Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. Starship Creator is very lacking and restrictive in its abilities. There is little flexibility. Hopefully the Star Trek franchise will come out with something much better soon. Let's keep our fingers crossed! Where is Q when you need him?,1.0
"This ""game"" is very primative, and not worth anywhere near what they charging for it.  In all honesty, i wouldn't keep the game if it was freeware, much less having to pay for it.
The concept of it is great,  but the product just isn't any good.  the missions are incredibly slow, and  boring, where you get to watch a vague resemblance of your ship slowly make  its way across the screen, while you read about stuff its going through.  no interaction whatsoever.  the designing part doesnt get very far either,  where there is no origionality.  If the game was made so that you could  design ships that you would use in other games, maybe it'd be worth it,  then.  but as of now, it just doesnt make the cut.
Very dissapointing!",1.0

"I purchased this Starship Creator Deluxe Edition.  I thought I got a good deal and can't wait to load it into my Pentium II computer.  Until I found I just made one big mistake in my life for purchased it.
No!  Even if you are a Star Trek Fan you won't like it.  And even if you have the best computer, this game won't do any good.
First of all, you won't get to create or design anything.  I am an  aerospace engineering student at UCLA, and I found it neither entertaining  or educating.  Second, you won't get any real 3-D graphics at all.  The  graphics is slightly better than the X-Wing game came out in 1993.
If  you try to name your own starships and print them out to show your friends,  they will laugh at you.  Because the poor graphics looks like you download  them from some freeware, and this program can't even put the letters in  their actual place on the ship's hull.

It freezes up frequently, making me restart very often, so I started saving my games like crazy.  But after 18 games, it lost the previous 3, taking me way back, and I couldn't get any further.

"Wow, I expected something decent when I bought this at my local Half-Price Books store, (I was on a Mortal Kombat Craze, hell I even bought MK:Annihilation at the same place on dvd) BUT THIS IS GOD AWFUL!!!

The Presentation is terrible! You only have a Choice of 6 characters. Scorpion, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Sub-Zero, Sonya. No Johnny Cage. The Game itself is just a 10 fighter tournament. About 6 fights of the same thing. then last 3 is Endurance rounds (aka tag team fighters) Then Goro fight where Goro just gropes you, then Shang Tsung fight. THE END.
Enter your name, turn off game, Rethink the past hour of your life, turn back on, name is not saved on leaderboard, OUT OF THIS HOUSE, OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

The Controls make me wish I was playing Shaq Fu! Im dead serious. Its incredibly sluggish! Every single button command has to be inputed slowly. To execute special moves, like scorpions's spear, heres how you input it:

Back, (1 sec pause), Back, (1 sec pause), B.  Don't try and speed-run this game.

The music is just an abomination, take a listen:

"Eternal Champions is an awesome game....for Sega CD.This version of it for Genesis is total crap. First of all,the game is almost IMPOSSIBLE to beat. You'll have one hell of a time just getting past the first fight. What makes it even worse is there is no way to adjust the difficulty level on this game neither. Another bad thing about this stinker is when you lose a match,you gotta keep hitting reset over and over again if you wanna change your fighter. This game sucks. There IS some history behind this game though. This was the very first exclusive fighting game that went straight to Genesis,and that wasn't in the arcade first. But that little history lesson doesn't save this terrible game. Oh and did I mention that you need a six button controller to play this game too?...You can play it with a three button pad,if you like to keep hitting the start button over and over again to change your punches into kicks. My best advice to you is to stay as far away from this game as you can,and pick up the Sega CD version of it.",1.0
"This game is the worst fighting game ever. You have to press start to change from punch to kick, the players are original, but just damn dumb, and the game is hard. You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person. The graphics are ok, but it's horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game, and you can't even change your character if you loose, so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change characters.",1.0
"This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible. Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system. As per the SEGA gargon. Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldn't handle the colors. So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial. Now we are stock with this thing. They kept most of the moves and all the colors, but doesn't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done. Before you defend this game, think of this. Super Street Fighter looked great, but they they just didn't take the time porting this game. And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab, choppy, and well peiced together.

 On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X. It is one of the best ports out there. This is one of the most ported games of all time, and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was.",1.0

"This is exactly what everybody has said already about this game. It's bad... REALLY BAD. The intro movie alone is enough to let you know what you're in for which is a whole lot of crap.

The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics. Seriously, it really does look like if you tried to make a 3D world out of construction paper. The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running, it's near impossible to turn/stop/maneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing *directly* under your shadow or you will get hit and die. Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you ""float"" a little.... it's completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floor-fan-enemies to float up. And the sounds.... ugggghhhh... oh my... atrocious.

But here's the thing about this torture devise... it's entertaining to a certain degree.

"My older brother and I enjoyed the Bubsy series for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo growing up.  Now that those systems were no longer creating any new titles in favor of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation, it was time to move on to the 64 bit world.  When Bubsy 3D was launched in 1997, we were so excited to try it out, but little do we know that we were being  tricked.  It was a pixelated 3D mess.  My brother got it for his 15th birthday and it was probaly the worst gift he receieved in time.  After trying to figure out this crappy game by enduring the confusing camera rotations, boring music, crappy navigation, and Bubsy's annoying random comments (throughout the game); we just went back to playing the original Bubsy on Sega Genesis.  I may have been the worst friend in the world because I gave Bubsy 3D to my best friend in exchange for Marvel Super Heroes game for Playstation.  This game tarnished the reputation of the lovable, sarcastic Bobcat.

"It is very difficult to talk about this miserable piece of crap without using profanity but I will try.
Where do I even start with this game? The backgrounds looked like they were made out of cardboard, construction paper, and glue by mentally retarded kindergarten kids from some country where those items are illegal. Every level looks the same and I think there is only one type of enemy in the whole game, a green alien who sneezes on you. Bubsy himself looks like something I drew on my desk in high school and has about as much animation. The camera sucks and will constantly move to the worst view possible and trying to control bubsy is like trying to drive a truck with your buttcheeks. This game has no music and the sound effects and voices are torture. This game is a cruel joke that you play on your friends, you taunt them with the controller saying ""wanna play a game? huh? huh?"". It's funny to play it for about a minute to see how bad it is, but that humor quickly turns to horror if you actually decide to beat a level.

I've never played a more retarded, slow, boring, poorly put together game in my life. Bubsy even beats Unlimited Saga on the crap list.

The 2 player aspect is just pathetic and completely useless. The whole concept of this game is sheer crap.

Graphics - 3/10

What can I say, the graphics suck. They're choppy, flat, glitchy, and utter chap.

Gameplay - 1/10

The movement sucks, the camera sucks, the fighting is just plain retarded. You either have to land perfectly on the exact top of the enemies head or you'll get hurt. Or you could try shooting a orby thingy at the enemy which explodes after like 3 seconds so you get no time to aim.

Sound - 2/10

Ha, don't make me laugh. Not even worth mentioning.

Replay - 0/10

Screw replaying. I didn't even beat the game. I played the first 2 levels and brought it back to the store. I was lucky to get my 15 bucks back which wasn't even worth it. I took my money and bought Spyro 2 instead which was a much better game.

"Well, here it is guys: the WORST Mortal Kombat game of all-time.  Yup, the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II.

I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time.  I was very naive (all my friends were right!)

Time hasn't been kind to this game, but who am I kidding?  Time wasn't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then, and it's trash now.  It will forever remain trash.  It's so trashy, the trashman won't even take it.  He says it stinks too much, and it's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck.  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world, he doesn't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently.

So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't).

I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day, than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again.  It's really that bad.  At least then, you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun.

If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price, I urge them to think twice. There are plenty of far, far better games for your money. I know there weren't that many RPGs for the N64 but that doesn't make this game a classic IMHO. You'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.",1.0

"I felt like doing an old game review just for the hell of it. This just happened to be it. *sigh* this game flat out well sucks... The only thing i like about it is the old school feel i get when playing it. The other this is that the spells look kinda cool. But in reallity the game has no real good plot combat system or even challenge really. If you wanna play this game, rent it, and then return it. Ya i know it was very disapointing huh, oh well not all games can be good. In all of my reviews..... IF you liked this game I laugh at you....",1.0
"I write this review to warn anyone interested in buying this game.  This game has the worst soundtrack of any RPG I've ever played, the worst battle system, worst plot development, and worst overall gameplay.  I passed this game quickly, and was vastly disappointed with it.  My mom bought the game for me and my brother, and she had no idea what she was spending her 75 dollars on.  It's not worth anyone's time, and I only played this game because someone I love bought it for me...however, if you want to buy an RPG, save your money and spend it on something worthwhile like any of the FF titles or Zelda.",1.0

"As said above I really didn't like this game. For one the story just wasn't anything special. I mean your dad disappears and you have to find him and some other magical jewels. *Yawn* Secondly the battle system was HORRIBLE! I mean you're stuck in this big hexagon which if you position yourself wrong or if you want to hit the stupid monster with your staff and you aren't close enough you miss and get attacked three or more times and die and then you start all over again. That happens so often it's not even funny. The graphics are okay, nothing special though. The magic graphics were especially lame though. I mean they lasted for five seconds max. Thirdly the characters were boring, period! I mean the characters had no growth and were about as interesting as a piece of sand paper. Overall this game gave me several headaches and was just plain boring. I guess it's because I expected something more like Zelda and was disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, period.",1.0
"Why does it take so long to get this game, i have checked every day in about 3 month's now and it allways says ""currently not available"" its getting quite annoing.",1.0
"First of all, Quest64 is definitely not the greatest game in the world.  Second of all, if you think Quest is cool, you should check out the Legend of Zelda games for N64!  There is no comparison.  On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best, Quest64 is a negative 7 and Zelda is a 12!
Quest64 has an easily understood storyline, as does Zelda.  They're both about a young boy trying to become a hero and save the world, to put it simply.  But Zelda takes off on the story more and does more with it.  It adds more detail.  Whereas Quest...how do I say this...doesn't.
The graphics in Quest are poor.  It's all in 3D, but it's choppy movement.  The battle settings are quite slow and dull, and there's really no excitement.  You know, when you look for a good video game, you want edge-of-your-seat action, and you want something that draws you in and keeps you playing.  You want to find a game that you can play for hours, but it only seems like minutes.  Well, if this is what you want, then you do not want to buy Quest!  It's BORING!!!!!
If you're in hot pursuit of a good game, then when you are browsing at the nearby Target or shopping around at Wal-Mart, then pass by the Quest64 game and grab a copy of either Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, or Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.  Don't waste your time or your hard-earned money on Quest64!",1.0

Even if you are doing well the computer starts walking away from you and only does sweeps on you and you won't be able to block it for long because your opponent can still grab you even though you are still blocking. It is not an opinion when I say this game sucks. This game would be a waste of money and time. I know because I bought one off ebay and I waited almost a week (very excitedly however) and I couldn't wait to get it into the system and after playing it for an hour I feel like ripping the game apart and throwing it in an incinerator, scoop out it's ashes and run it over repeatedly with a monster truck.

"This is not what you'd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series. The game has a really basic plot: The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey  Kong's island. Everyone, including me, was expecting super graphics from  the expansion pack (which you need to play this game). Not true. The  graphics are a bit better then the average game, but not as good as they  could be. The game is remarkably similar to Banjo-Kazoie (another 1 star  game) in that you learn moves as you progress through the game, something I  HATE! The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying. However,  probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly  challenging. I beat the first level fully and almost beat the 2nd through  5th levels in the first week I had it and I haven't touched it since. The  only good part is the multi-player mode. So, if you're going to buy an N64  game, look elsewhere.",1.0

I guess I get what I paid for. I got the game that was sent from a medical companies address. I thought Ok no big deal maybe they were using his bosses labels to save money on postage. I can understand having friends that are trying to do a start up company. So I put the game in and it had all of the start up logos and music I remember. However when I tried to play the actual game it went into VS mode. Then it dawned on me. He copied his game on to a blank slapped a label on it and sent it out. It wasn't a full copy it was just the VS portion of the game. Lesson learned. Not going to buy from this seller again and I urge others not to as well.,1.0

"To this generation doom 64 would look like the most cruddy game ever concived.but it is far better than about 95% of the games on most consoles,but this game is not without blemish.let us start out with the following....
1) the good, the graphics are spectacular for a n64 FPS the enemis are well animated as well as the levels themselves,the lighting effects are divine when there is a neon red light not only will it show on your gun but also the enemies too,there is no music but there is ambient sounds and what not,the story seems to be the same old same old but this is not bad.

now heres the bad news(this should be read by parents for there own benefit)
the bad-as you know Doom is about a group of scientist that find a martian lab
that in game terms opened a portal to hell,so guess what the scientist do
they open the portal and low and behold they let out a boat load of demons that either kill or zombifiy the people there(you'll find some of the limbs ,and such in the levels, of the unfortunate ones) and you are sent to exterminate them and close the portal. the blood/gore factor of game is not pretty, of course i have not got past the third level but if i know Doom well its not going to get any better,as for demonic/satanic i haven't found any yet but there is 100% chance you'll find some in the latter levels,thats all for now for the bad.

in conclusion i would never recommend this game to anyone and this game should be avoided at all cost!!!(even though it is a high graphics games)

I couldn't find a control setup that didn't suck.  For all I know, the game itself, should you be able to slog through with these abysmal controls, may be quite good.

"As you probably know, Nintendo depends on their Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and all the other stupid characters. Those are the only N64 and Gamecube platformers. Nintendo people are obviously on drugs when they make video games. Here's a monkey. Oh, let's say some weird little thing steals this other monkey! Oh , yeah. That's how the game was created.

  Nintendo games are creative, but sometimes overly so. In Yoshi's Story, play a few minutes and you'll obviously know that it was marketed to 5-year-olds. Now to the game, it's DUMB. There's not one aspect of it that's fun. You run around being some fat blob of monkey trying to get ""Golden Bananas"" that are a obvious ripoff of Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie. Just signals they're out of ideas. This has gotten rave reviews from just about anybody that has played it and I have no friggin idea why. It's just dumb and so is Nintendo. Nintendo Revolution? *rolls eyes* It will revolutionize bad gaming.

"I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.

Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.

I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.

"I have to say this is one of the most bland, boring, idiotic games I have EVER played. Sorry if you like this game, but I found that Rareware did a pretty bad job on it. Banjo Kazooie actually made sense, while this game is simply about some monkeys, (Ugly ones at that) chasing after a crocodile who for some dumb reason hates them. The worlds look all the same, but with different backdrop, and somehow you always end up running into the same enimies, no matter WHERE you are. I found the worlds to be either too similar to the others, too big (In a bad way, which means you run around for a very long time in boring scenery and did I mention VERY annoying music) or they are just too gloomy or happy.
Another annoying part of this game is the characters. So what if there are 5 of them? The only ones that looked slightly sane were diddy and donkey kong. What I mean is that lanky kong was just plain scary, as were the two others. The graphics weren't that good, and the weapons are absolutely awful - it's hard to aim, and everytime you fire it makes an annoying noise. Your ammo is fruit, and 5 characters is way too much for the game. It means you have to go back and forth, just to get a stupid puzzle done. It's hard to control your character and though you need an expansion pack or whatever, the graphics are pretty bad. They look just like anything else, and are worse than Mario 64's graphics which are VERY good. My other peeve about this game is the collecting of objects. It goes on FOREVER, there is NO END TO IT!!! I have so many dislikes about this sgame, that I'd go on forever, but I'm going to stop right here and give up, as I did in this game.",1.0

It was also because I was really young then and I really didn't know what the game was really about, which is puzzle solving sometimes.

"Back when this pile of dreck came out, I was hyped for it and I had to have it as at the time I was / still am a hard core Aliens fan. And to be honest, the controls were horrible, the graphics were...meh...at best, the AI...okay, that at least was above normal at the time...but the rest...
Story: Er...someone on the story department clearly didn't bother and instead just tossed some dribble together and hoped no one would even notice.
The level layouts were backwards and convoluted to the point that it was starting to give me headaches, seriously! For crying out loud, this is supposed to be taking place on a R&D Starship, not freaking downtown NY! The levels should not be so damn confusing to where you have to sit and memorize where you've been and what doors you opened!

It is BORING as hell if you're in the least expecting something that even remotely looks like a plot line (I mean, hell... during the parts when you talk to your team, its in FREAKING TEXT! TEXT! NO VOICE ACTING! How freaking cheap can you get?!?!)
If you need me to break it down for you all looking to buy this, I will:

Pros: Slightly polished above norm. PSX GFX.
Game AI was above normal for a PSX title.

Cons: Horrible controls.
No plot / story.
No voice acting at all.
Horrible, convoluted, backwards level design.

OVERALL: This is a game that I wouldn't even buy for my own worst enemy. But if you have to have it, you have been warned of what lies ahead.

"Allied General is a good concept, allowing individuals to be the 'good guys' after experiencing Panzer General. In practice, it is absurdly difficult. For one thing, assigning the allies a set number of turns for victory is ridiculous. Would Stalin, FDR, or Churchill have given up after Stalingrad because of any kind of time factor whatsoever?! The wildly inncurate historical errors spring forth from the very beginning of play. The Russians took an embarrassingly long time to crush Finland, but ultimate Soviet victory was never in doubt.
  Prestige points are stingily awarded, considering the kind of economic superiority enjoyed by the allies. And the later scenarios actually have post D-Day battles where both sides have numerical equality.

At first glance you might think this game is pretty cool; after all, the graphics are very well done and the animation is very fluid. But when you realize that you have a total of three moves--punch, kick, jump--and that you can defeat any evil kung fu master just by endlessly jump kicking across the screen and bouncing like a pogo stick, you realize this is not going to be a very deep fighting game. But, yeah, the graphics are pretty good so this game doesn't suck as bad as it possibly could. And then you remember that it's about a basketball hero who just happens to be a world-class martial artist, and that that martial artist is none other than Shaquille O'Neil. And you realize that you have too much free time on your hands, and that maybe you're playing this cart because you're really desperate to be entertained, and then you realize you were having more fun with Bimini Run, which you go back to. OK, to be fair, this game isn't nearly as bad as Bimini Run but it's still pretty ridiculous. Recommended only for those who enjoy a nice steaming pile of crap.",1.0

"I remember renting for the weekend at our local video store ages ago. It took about an hour to figure out how to make the grappler hit the sweet spot so I could get to the second floor. That was only the first level! In case you're wondering, I had no problem getting past the first stage in other video games. So it wasn't my lack of experience, it was the abysmal game design. The music, or at least the music I heard (as I stopped playing after the first level) was mediocre. If you really want to play a Batman Game for SNES, I recommend ""Batman Returns"" and ""The Adventures of Batman and Robin"". Some ""bad"" games can still be fun but this one isn't.",1.0
"As the other reviews have stated, this is a very boring game. You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface. An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat, high punch, low punch, up to jump and select to use your grappling hook. When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs, gas guns and baterangs. There's not much to the game, you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys. The graphics are pretty amazing, being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat, so are the graphics!",1.0

"So after the success of Batman Returns, there would be a movie adaption of Batman Forever.  The graphics looked interesting.  Almost a next gen feel for the SNES.  And it would be a brawler.  So how could it go wrong?  Well first off, it feels like they are trying to rip off Mortal Kombat.
But the worst sin is that the controls are horrendous.  They are so frustrating.  I remember spending most of my time mashing buttons just trying to get my grappling hook to work.  Still brings up bad memories all these years later!

Unfortunately, my copy of the game is so distorted from use and abuse, it can't be played.  What little visual I have on screen is just a pixelated blob.

I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift. It was her favorite video game as a kid and she was so excited when she opened it, but then ultimately disappointed when I put it in her brand new SNES. It didn't work at all. Nothing but garbled 8 bit theme music and a glitched out screens. The cartridge was loose and floppy, dirty, and had what looked to be burn marks on it. This does not qualify to me as condition Used- Very Good  to me. I returned for refund and found a like new condition one at our local used games shop for $15 less than what I paid for it from this seller as well.

"This is so obviously just a game to milk money.  It came out after Mario Kart 64, a great game by the way in many respects, and this one is just so cheap and tacky.  First of all, Mario Kart is fun because you get to go to worlds you recognize and see characters you've loved for years; in this game, however, you don't see any of that, except Diddy, that's it.  And the atmosphere of DK is inexistent, they just through a bunch of crap together to make raceways... a lot of raceways.  Yes, you race a lot, which is fine because this is after all a racing game, but how should one feel after having to race the same bunch of tracks 3 times, while having to race a 'boss' 2?  Yes, each world has like 5 tracks and a boss, from what I remember, and you race them a lot, so you have to race 17 times every single world.  Oh yeah, and there's some other really unnecessary stuff on the side that you have to race too.  This game is so tedious, lacking, and cheap all together; but, how does no one else see that?",1.0
"What can I say, this game was dumb!  It's just a copycat of Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart 64 has freakin' fun!  Diddy Kong Racing is a joke!

"Perhaps it's my fault. I played the original Legend of Zelda for NES and I loved it. The gameplay was fantastic and it kept me busy for many weekends. So when Link to the Past hit the shelves, I hit the ground running to the nearest game store to pick up a copy. I can't tell you how disappointed I was after four hours of playing -- but I'll try to tell you anyway.

The introduction to this game is beautiful -- cutscenes and wonderfully rendered 16-bit graphics laying out the lore of Hyrule and preparing you to start your journey as Link. This is as good as it gets, people.

The game begins with you (Link) in your uncle's house. As link awakens, he sees his uncle, dressed for battle. The uncle instructs Link to wait for him to return as he leaves the house.

Minutes pass. More minutes pass. Link's uncle said we couldn't leave the house, but he didn't say anything about the bed, right?! I hop down from the bed and walk around the modest home my virtual uncle has made for himself. It's pretty boring.

An hour passes. I try to play with some of the assorted jars on his shelf, but to no avail. Oh ho, but there are some pots I can pick up next to the bed -- they're quite breakable, though, I learned. Link's uncle would be most displeased to find his pots in a crumbled mess on the floor -- if he ever CAME BACK.

After three and a half hours of waiting, I shut off the Super Nintendo, and sold my copy of the game. Nintendo, I don't know what you were thinking, but making an adventure game that imposes rules on the player and confine them to a home is NOT my idea of adventuring! ""I'll be back in the morning."" Were you trying to teach children about coping with patriarch-figure abandonment? This uncle left Link to rot!

I would not play this game again.",1.0

"This was the most boring game I've ever bought.  Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you.  It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters.  The valiant  effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent.  It's tedious  going through the same mini-quests over and over.  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game.
This was a  good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety.
If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.",1.0

"First of all, this game is very outdated. The framerate and blocky images that litter the levels are nauseating. Right now in 2009 I still enjoy a lot of classic Playstation FPS's like Doom & Alien Trilogy, but I have to say ""Dark Forces"" is almost unplayable. The actual blasting of Storm Troopers may be monotonous, but it's fun-for about 5 minutes. The problem is that Dark Forces has some of the WORST level design in FPS history, and even the most experienced explorer of crappy old dungeon-type FPS's will probably get lost for hours in each level, constantly backtracking and circuiting through the same hallways looking for some key or some means of completing an objective. Even with the aid of walkthroughs and Youtube videos, I spent at least 45 minutes on each level stepping over the same imperial corpses about 150 times trying to figure out where the hell to go. This game is kind of like a really crappy badly-designed Doom WAD that uses the same textures over and over and is about half of what Duke Nukem or Doom is. If you're really curious, don't spend more than a dollar on it. ----Oh, I should mention also that many PS1 games can have smoothened textures when you play on the PS2. Doom looks very nice on the PS2, but THIS game seems to have no difference! Same blockiness! Same migraine-inducing framerate! I can see copies of this playstation-game forming their own hill on Ord Mantell's junkyard.",1.0
"The fact that those two wrestlers aren't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it.

"Well, we have another example of a game that is selling itself with hype and screenshots. First of all, the graphics are great, good, best.  No dispute there. However...what is important in an RPG? Gameplay? Tactics?  hohoho...there are none. You just keep clicking the mouse as fast as you  can and the AI guys keep hitting as fast as they can. You move from room to  room where monsters sit in one place and wait for you. The spell system is  very bad. The game has much more action than the pen and paper game, so 80%  of the spells are useless. Yes, you use your healing and maybe a few damage  spells but there is absolutely no reason to use anything else. The  stats...well, they seem complex but have a very small impact on combat,  which I must say again, is devoid of tactics. The Group AI has some faults  especially when ranged weapons are used (most felt in the modern day part)  since your vampire friends will repeatedly shoot at walls without going  around them to get a clear shot at the monsters. Story...I though it would  be good, original, and immersive. I don't know how, but they managed to  fail at doing that. It is very linear, predictable, not exiting, and is  nothing like the vampire books that spawned the game. I have not and will  not play the multiplayer game since in this combat system the speed of your  mouse clicks determines your characters combat performance, and no  story-teller, no matter how good he is, can fix this. Well? Do I think I am  out of my mind? A few days ago, I would have thought the same. Alas, I  bring you the sad truth. Vampire the Maskerade sucks and the people that  made it should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a poor game.  Still don't believe me? Check out the 'professional' reviews on sites like  gamespot and they will tell you the same thing.",1.0
"I've been playing Tomba since it came out and loved the story, the characters, the game play, graphics, animations, side games, and everything.  In my mind, that game is one of the best (if not the sole best) platform games created.  One could play that game over and over again and still have different things to do.  I heard raving reviews about the second game that rivalled the first, and loving the first game I gave the sequel a try.  Much to my dismay, the graphics in the game are blurry, blocky, and distracting.  The highly-rated speaking voices of the characters and the music are as annoying and distracting as well.  The ""events"" are ambiguous and confusing and random, and it seems like the direction of the gameplay has been child-proofed (someone tells you where to go, you go there on a set path).  The areas in the game aren't as imaginative and don't have as much texture and depth as the first game.  The most aggrivating feature of this game is that Tomba is now, for some reason, ridiculously tough to control!  There's a lag between controller and motion, and his movements are rigid and sticky.  I thought the ""bird-suit"" would be something like the ""funky parasol"" from the first game, an item that when equipped would help Tomba glide gracefully to the ground- but it does the opposite!  Tomba glides for a second (rigidly and tweakishly, of course), then proceeds to fall quickly suddenly!  This game is an eyesore and for me much more of an annoyance to have to play than the laid-back and visually-stunning pleasure the first Tomba game was.  I'm definitely getting rid of this game as soon as I can!",1.0

"while Kings field held me enthralled, while I adapted to the combat system and overlooked some small flaws. the second outing completely dissapointed me. while the gameplay remained much the same, I found no reason to continue further in this one.

"So i bought this game, and when i recieved it, it was tucked away in a paper envelope, just the disk and nothing else.....and lo and behold, when i take it out, it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable, so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it, i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at $25. I might review the game when i actually play it, but don't buy it without a case, make sure when you order it, it comes in some kind of protective casing, not just a disk in a sleeve

Actual Game Review: Duke is still the man, even today
Score: 5 out of 5

Ok, the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour, so i decided to try antoher one, and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour.....and it's just as awesome, the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive. Graphics wise it's not that bad, but it's a PS1 game from 1996, but graphics don't make the game, look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil, and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two. If you're an action game fan, a Duke Nukem fan, or just want pure action, big explosions, bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego, check this game out.",1.0
"I have and Intel 366 Celeron on the i810 chipset. I only expected average  results form my average system but this game will not work at all with the  i810!

I bet their answer will be to shell out $200 for a add  on card.  Don't buy unless you have a power system.

"I sadly remember the day when this game was released.  I had waited long enough, and finally I had the game in my hands.  I remember being so excited until about 1 hour into the game.  It was then that I realized that  this game was terrible.
The graphics were nice, and the cut scenes were  above average.  The voices sounded good, and the combat was a little fast,  but adequate.
But I wasn't having fun.  I realized that the game was  pretty deep, and dwelling deeper into the game's cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI, terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system, and  scrappy mouse driven interface.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I wished I  could just watch the game instead of play it, then I would of been  happy.
I did what I had to do, and finally uninstalled it.  I thought of  all the money I spent, and went to find another game.  What a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product.  If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay,  then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo 2, not this game.",1.0

"Overall:  Not Impressed
Good:
  Pretty Graphics
  Ok Story
Bad:
  Saving while playing the game  not pratical, but can be  overcome
  Spells are  completley useless in battle  (there was no time to casts spell  other  then an occasional heal spell)
  Group  Problems:
  -  There is no control over your  group in battle
  -  Group constantly geting stuck  behind walls and other objects
  -  Group wastes ammo and  mana
  -  Group would constantly get  themselves  killed by charging into  large groups of creatures
  -  I was eventually forced to leave  group at zone  entrance and solo  the zone, calling on the group  only when needed

"Okay, I have to admit that the graphics and sound are top notch, better than I've seen in a very long time, but the game is otherwise a disappointment.  Unfortunately, after all the hype, the game falls short of  being a role playing game.  You don't get to make your own character (for  the main game), the opportunities to make a choice for your  ""character"" are few and far between, and the choices you make  have little or no effect on what happens (I made different choices for the  same thing and got the same result each time).  The game essentially leads  you by the nose.  In addition, there are long, drawn out cinematic  sequences (excellent graphics) where your character interacts with  individuals, and you have NO CONTROL over what happens during these scenes.  The single player game is a pretty decent hack-n-slash/shooter game with  excellent graphics, and an okay interface, but role playing it isn't.  There are no opportunities for real strategy, role play, or thought, and  the multiplayer game that has the potential to closely resemble the pen and  paper version (the storyteller feature is a cool idea) has so many holes it  resembles swiss cheese.",1.0

"Why do I rate this game 1 star? There are several reasons. First and foremost, there is NO SAVEPOINT. In short, you'll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING. Talk about patience. The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much. It is a top-down shooter AND a first-person shooter. The graphics in the top-down mode are fine, but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL. Doom has FAR better variety, texture-wise. Personally, I got headaches after playing in FP mode after 30 minutes--and remember, you can't save. So the bottom line is this, if you want to kill dinosaurs, I'd recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC. N64 has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out.

"One of the worst PC to console adaptations ever made.

I will list the flaws that this abomination contains.

1) Grainy and choppy graphics.

2) Seriously plauged by slow-down, the SNES graphics engine can hardly keep up with a big game like Doom. Console systems weren't desinged to have high memory PC games played on them.

3) Downroght Pi$$ Poor controls. You NEED a mouse to play this game, a D-Pad just will not cut it.

4) Not even the whole game.

5) Sound is uttley horrendus.

6) No Main Menu, just puts you right into thew game as you turn it on. Yep, thats right kids, no control or difficulty settings.

7) This must be (permanatly) set on the ""Please Don't Hurt Me!"" difficulty setting because it is just way to easy.

8) Why are you even trying to play this game on a Super Nintendo?

9) No recoil when you fire Rockets, like in the PC version.

10) Just avoid this version of the game.

11) Since it's Nintendo, it's also heavily censored. You need the blood and satanic refrences in this game to fully enjoy it.

"What a disgrace to Marvel. Neither Spidey nor the X-Men come out of this with integrity left. It's seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis. Terrible graphics, worse gameplay and awful music. Don't be like me and assume that it must be good because Spidey is involved. I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad, bad game.  It is sort of a cross between a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a run-and-gun game, but succeeds at neither.

It really just feels like any other generic platformer that was reskinned as a Marvel game halfway through development as very little of the gameplay feels unique to the characters. Why is Spidey jumping up ledges to climb buildings? Why is he not wall-crawling? There is some crawling, but it feels like an afterthought. The character sprites are small and puny with little weight to the animation or impact to the action, and the level design is haphazard, repetitive and generic. Sometimes you'll even have difficulty identifying exactly what the environment is supposed to be. As for the music, well...it's not memorable. It's just noise, honestly.

Stay away!",1.0
I bought this game a long time ago when it first came out.  I wish I would have rented it first but I bought it anyway because it had Spiderman and the X-Men in it.

Froze every 2 seconds and that's If I was lucky enough to get it started. Good condition was hardly the correct description for this game.,1.0
"I bought this game 3 days ago and already I found it a rather grave disappointment.  Allow me to tell you why:
-Switching between different screens (ex. research screen to starmap screen) takes 3-5 seconds.  Unlike the previous reviewers, I happen to know for a fact that my hardware is more than capable of handling anything that is thrown at it.  It's merely bad coding ettiquite.  This is unacceptable especially in a multiplayer situation.
-The research system is SLOW.  It costs too much or takes too long (usually both unfortunately).  On top of that, the research system only allows you to research ONE item at a time.  This is extremely tedious, and makes it impossible to research most of the good items.  By the time you research something you REALLY want to use, all of the planets are either in your possession or you're dead.
-Star systems only have one planet per star.  This is just a minor gripe, but it takes out the essence of simulating star system colonization.  This also removes any possibility of one star system being more productive than another since you can terraform.
-You can only play 3 races.  Multiplayer allows you to have up to 8, but if you choose single player you only can pick 3.  This is extremely disappointing considering each of the 8 races has unique attributes, but 63% of those attribues are gone if you decide to make it solo.
-All 3 branches of research require too much attention.  I feel like I'm playing Sim City trying to manage where my population is supposed to work I'd rather be handling conquering the galaxy.
-Combat resembles Warcraft/C&C/Starcraft, but lacking many of the options you find in other games.  Even more annoying is that you have no control over your fighters, and many advances you make in the ship research department have little or no noticable affect during battle.
That's not to say the game is all that bad.  The Spy feature is nice, and the plots for single player are actually entertaining.  Graphics are top-notch for this genre of game (strategy), but again, at the cost of waiting 3-5 seconds between different screens.  If you're into multiplayer, all of the races are very balanced and this allows you to apply many different types of strategy.
But I suppose I am overly disappointed because this game lacks personality.  You get hints of Starcraft, hints of Master of Orion, and occasionally a little Dark Reign here an there.  Unfortunately I have yet to find anything in the game that tells me I'm playing Imerium Galactica II.",1.0

"The best part of Risk 1 was Ultimate Risk. Strategic attack and defense options, generals, terrain difficulties, and forts, made for ever changing and stimulating gameplay. The only problem was the computer AI which caused some opposing forces to make moves contrary to common and tactical sense. I  was looking forward to playing Risk 2 against more intelligent  opponents.
Microprose, a quality game developer, decided not to include  Ultimate Risk in Risk 2. It now has a variation called simultaneous Risk.  All players make all attack decisions at once for a turn, then you press a  button and the attacks are carried out. There is no flexibility to change  tactics based on changing fortunes of war.
This brings us back to  playing only Classic Risk on a board that looks graphically like it was  taken from a DOS game in 1993. The battle boxes are graphically state of  the art. I watched the battles unfold a few times, said, ""Cool,""  and turned them off to speed up gameplay.

Although it may seem as if I am being harsh towards this product, it is very well deserve as this simply did not work at all. I first saw this listing and thought it was an amazing deal. An original SNES plus 5 classic Mario games, as well as the extended cord controllers! What could go wrong? Well, my excitement was quickly diminished when I saw that the console wasn't producing any video or audio onto my television. This confused me because most of the reviews I had read were saying that it was a great deal and that it was working perfectly, so I decided to do some research and attempted some troubleshooting. It turns out in order to get this console to work, I would have to do a full restoration on the console, as the connectors are all fried and some are even broken. This would involve multiple very advanced methods such as soldering and buying new parts which I don't have any previous knowledge of doing.

Then to make matters worse once I was finally able to power the system up I found that neither one of the controllers even worked!!!!!  Once the new controllers I purchased arrived and I finally got to use the console and included games for the first time, I also discovered the Mario All-stars game erases all saved game progress after ejecting game cartridge and/or changing to the other Mario games on same cartridge.

"I know what you'e thinkin'!!  I love Street Fighter 2, especially the Champion Edition because it super cool, fun, and has the outstanding graphics for its time, great selectable characters, and fluent controls.  Thats good and all for Super NES releases, but what was Sega thinking when releasing this game on the Genesis?  Read carefully because there are two major things I find wrong with the release on this console.

1. The buttons are limited.  I know that the Genesis has three main buttons other than start, but a standard fighting game has six buttons (HK, MK, LK, HP, MP, LP), not three!!  I don't know if this game is programmed for Genesis' new six button controller, but in order to use punch and kick buttons, you have to switch it up by pressing start, but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent.
2. THERE'S NO PAUSE BUTTON!!!  In order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa, they made it for the start button!!
Theres absolutely no excuse for a 16-bit game to not have a pause button!
If you dare to play this game on the Genesis, make sure you have no interruptions: go to the bathroom before playing, make sure your parents don't need anything for two hours, and leave a message on your answering machine that says ""I'm playing Street Fighter 2 on the Genesis that has no pause button, leave a message after the beep.
