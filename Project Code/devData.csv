"I love the patterns in this book, like having 2 size blocks to choose from and the directions are very easy to read and understand.  I've made 6 blocks so far and very happy with the way they turn out",5.0
Very nice book,5.0
This was what I expected..and more! This book is chock full of ideas as well as patterns- wonderful!,5.0
"Gift for my quilting wife, who absolutely loves it.",5.0
"This book is well worth the money!  The sampler on the cover shows most of the block patterns but there are more.  The possibilities of quilts, table runners, placemats, wall hangings, and potholders are endless as there are so many patterns to choose from.  Lori Holt shows many of those ideas so if you have trouble w/ your imagination, no problem!  This is probably already my favorite quilt investment.",5.0
This book is one of the best quilting books I have ever purchased. It has so many different quilt blocks. Tons of ideas for quilts. You can make a quilt with all different blocks or make a quilt with one particular block. I am very very happy with this book.,5.0
"Screaming with delight!  Based on the cover I thought this would be a sampler quilt (which it is), but it is so much more.  The blocks are available in two sizes...there are other farm quilts in here and a lot of them.  If you are a fan of samplers this is for you.  Want chickens, chicks, tractors, kitchen bowls, cups and more...again this book is for you!",5.0
Great patterns!  Can't wait to get started!,5.0

"Great quilt book.  It has all the blocks in it that are on the front cover.  I'm a farm girl, and this is perfect for me to make a country quilt.",5.0
Love the quilts in this book! I am a beginner quilter and love that there are small projects also. Have made a couple of the potholders and plan to try many more of the other patterns. This is a beautiful book with easy to follow directions.,5.0
I love this pattern book.,5.0
Love the book!,5.0
if you like country quilt this is the book for you,5.0
"I love the style, format and colors for the patterns in this book. I love that each block can be made in a 6"" or 12"" size. The patterns for using the made up blocks are ones I will actually make. I hate getting a book and not liking most of the patterns...this one is 100% LOVE... The spiral format is nice for being able to open to a page and leave it open. After going thru the book, I looked up the author on you tube, Love her simple ways without fancy sewing equipment. Using vintage irons, and graph paper for making new patterns. Great tutorial on making simple boards for your patchwork squares on the go, auditioning fabrics and keeping your pieces in order to bring to the sewing machine. I feel like I found a new cyber friend! I recommend this book and I am a city girl...who is country at heart.",5.0
Love it!,5.0
"Very clearly written, easy to follow directions. Nice color photos, lots of arrangements. Love this book and highly recommend it!",5.0
This book has fantastic directions and is full of inspiration for a huge variety of ways to use the blocks. I predict it will keep me engaged for some time!,5.0
"Fantastic book! Instructions, and many layout ideas",5.0
A VERY amazing quilting book. Love all the patterns doing a sew along with a ladies group extremely pleased with it.,5.0
Such good instructions and pictures great book,5.0
Looks like fun. Can't wait to get started.,5.0
I love this book! Wonderful photos and direction. And I love all the alternate projects in the back. The only thing I wish is if she would have given the total yardage needed for shashing and background for the sampler quilt.,5.0
This is going to be used for my next strip quilt. Can't wait to get started.,5.0
Already made 8 blocks! Great directions; very cute blocks; All pieces fit together as expected;,5.0
"Too little time; too many quilts to make
Great book.  Buy it.  We can always say we are going to do all the blocks.",5.0
"A quilter can't have too many books.. I swore I'd never buy more until I saw this one. Love the fact she has blocks in two sizes and I have to admit, it was the adorable chicken block that sold me. Love the spiral binding. Just fun to look through. Very clear directions, even for this quilter who is marginally ""directionally challenged"". It's got table runners too. fantastic book.",5.0
Can't wait to start on the quilt. Nice spiral bound book!,5.0
Fun patterns. Easy to understand directions. I would not recommend for beginners as some blocks require many pieces and could be a challenge.  Super fun quilts will be made from this book. I love that the blocks come in two sizes as well.,5.0
"Wonderful book! Haven't made anything yet, but pictures and instructions seem great! Collecting fabric...",5.0
"I am new to quilting. Just started in May, 2015. I got a little ambitious and thought I'd try my hand at following the quilt along with Lori Holt through this book. I gotta say, I had a ball making every block in this book, with the exception of 2 of them I haven't made yet. I made the 6 inch blocks, and even for a newbie, they weren't very complicated thanks to the awesome instructions and visuals! It's been 6 months since I started quilting and I gained lots of experience by doing the blocks in this book!  You will not regret purchasing Farm Girl Vintage!!",5.0
"I love traditional and modern quilts and I feel like this book does a great job of combining the two with some new, fun quilt patterns. The directions are easy to follow and clear. As a new quilter I even started out with a harder quilt block (the farmhouse) but was able to successfully construct it. The patterns included in this book make me so happy! I'm inspired to create every time I open it!",5.0
"I love it, yet haven't been able to use it yet, but am so looking forward to making my own version - so many ideas!",5.0
"This is a gift, she picked it out, so it will be perfect.",5.0
Love this book,5.0
"Love the book . A new quilter can easily make a beautiful quilt using this book. Excellent use of fabric. Wil become a favorite of many quilters.
Great book!",5.0
"Our quilt group is going through this book, making each block.  Some of the blocks are very traditional and some are done oddly (the simple star for example.  Who thought up that method of making flying geese?  It works, but it's weird)  My favorites are the chicken blocks and tractors.  There are so many blocks that this book is useful for most traditional quilters. One thing that is great is that most blocks are given in both 6 inch and 12 inch, and the six inch are shown used on barn sides, with the patterns for the barns.  The blocks are shown down in bright colors.  I went for more textured looking fabrics: feather fabrics on the chickens and roof fabric for the roof of the house and barn, and the blocks still look great.",5.0
Love this book.,5.0
Beautiful quilting book with easy to understand instructions. Is one of my favorites as it captures the beloved sights and memories of the life of a farmgirl.,5.0
This is perfect!,5.0
"If  you are a quilter this book is a ""must have."" Worth every penny!!!",5.0
There are enough blocks and projects in this book that you could work for ages and still not be finished with all the possibilities!  Lori Holt is so creative and her quilt blocks are so fun that I don't see this ever becoming boring.  This is a wonderful book.,5.0

"I love this book, and have made a couple blocks from it.  Interesting to read through the book.  I plan on doing a wall hanging from 30's fabric, once I complete the other priorities I am working on.",5.0
"This book is so inspirational. I cannot wait to make all the blocks. I have 3 done so far and many more to come.  A wonderful online community to follow as well, with different ways people mix their fabrics to accomplish the blocks.  Very detailed instructions, pictures, and measurements.  The extra projects are cute as well. LOVE Lori's books.",5.0

Made a small quilt in short order.  Was able to use only my scraps except for the backing.  Lots of variety.,5.0

Love the book.  Did a retreat with the author.  Very easy to understand for a beginner. (which I am,5.0
Lori does it again. Great book.,5.0
"The directions in this book are VERY clear.  There are cutting instructions for 2 sizes of each block.  There are examples of how to combine them into quilts, but the possibilities are endless.  Wonderful photography. I can see possibilities for a modern quilt as well as vintage style quilt.  I am very glad I added this book to my library.",5.0
Love this book! Lots and lots of easy to follow patterns. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who quilts!,5.0
This is a very beautiful and well planned book.  The pages are all bright and beautiful with pictures and instructions.  I love all the ideas for making different kind of quilts using the blocks in addition to the sampler on the front cover.  The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat for when you want to make the blocks.  Lori's story about being raised on a farm is very inspiring.,5.0
"One of the best values in quilt books that I have purchased to date.  The forward in charming, the patterns and instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I also love the variety of projects Lori lists in the back of the book.  The spiral binding is a dream! I would definitely recommend this book.",5.0
Beautiful book...,5.0
"Love the book , lots of quilts possible !",5.0
"Wow!  just WOW!  You will want to do EVERY project in this book.  And there are a TON.  Possibilities endless.  Her instructions are very clear and very generous.  Often times patterns and books just give you the minimal amount of information.  I appreciate all the different combinations for making an endless list of quilts and projects.  SOOOOO worth the money.  If I had to choose just ONE book of my bazillion to keep, this would be the one.  Great for beginners, experienced, busy, not so busy, everyone!  My quilting IQ just went up  a bit after having gone through this book today!

side note:  I wish it were a hard cover spiral binding...I was a little let down that it was just a thin cardboard style cover over the spiral.",5.0
So many cute ideas!  Can't wait to get busy!!,5.0
I absolutely love this book.  The block difficulties vary from quick and easy to takes some time but doable and they are all worth it.  I can't wait to dive in and start my own doing.  Quilt block combination ideas are given to get the more novice quilter started but really they all will work together with the right fabric choices.  Thank You Lori!,5.0
Great Book!!!!!!!,5.0
Prompt delivery of the product exactly as described = happy customer! Thank you!,5.0
"All of the blocks in this quilt are fun and fairly easy to make.  I love using the 30's reproductions as Lori Holt did.  The stories about the blocks and the extra projects in the book make it well worth the price.  Having lived on a farm for many years, these quilt blocks are reminiscent of those years. A spiral binding on a quilt pattern book is fabulous as the book lies flat while you are following a pattern.",5.0
I love this book!  It has so many fun patterns...you just want to try them all.  I love the photography and the instructions are written very well.  I love how the book lays open flat because of the spiral back. Lori Holt's patterns are just very fun!,5.0

Great book shipped right on time thank you,5.0
Love it!!,5.0
I love the patterns in this book and all the different ideas she suggests as well. Takes you through each block step by step with illustrations and even which direction to press the seams.,5.0
This book is probably the most versatile quilting book that I own and I'm so glad that I bit the bullet and decided to buy it at full price.  There' a myriad of projects to be made from these blocks and that makes it totally worth the price!,5.0
"What a fun book!  The patterns are really cute---2 sizes, 6 inch and 12.  Good cutting directions, so even the Kindle version would be useable.  I like the ""hard copy,"" though, with it's spiral binding.  So many quilt possibilities here, I can't decide where to start:  the 12 inch barns with 6 inch quilt blocks in them, or a sampler quilt with all the blocks or a block of stars?  (I love stars!) ...or ???  So many choices, but a delighted dilemma.",5.0
"Love it, can't wait to make it.",5.0
"Wonderful book, can't wait to get started using the patterns.",5.0

I love this find. I have kept one for my other children and they have stopped making them the way they did when they were younger.  I'm excited each time I open it to add to my daughters future memory book.  So well put together.  Would make a great gift for a first time Mom as this is simply not something people think about until the memories are long forgotten.,5.0
A absolutely love this. I am planning on keeping track of my daughters school years and this is exactly what I was looking for. I love the folders to save her best artwork and school papers.,5.0
This school book is so adorable and so girly! My daughter was so excited when we got it. She has so much fun filling out the little questions and adding pictures and special school work to it. It will be a fun project for the 2 of us for years to come,5.0

"I bought this memory book for my younger daughter as my oldest had one and I couldn't find the same book.  I found this book on Amazon reasonably priced for what you get!  The pages are really cute and girly.  There is a page for preschool all the way through 12th grade, with room for pictures and ample pockets for memories or samples of work.",5.0

"Love it! All 3 of my boys have there's so when I was looking for my daughter's last year, I was disappointed. No fundraiser had one, no stores. A different seller had one posted for $997!?!? I checked again once school started and found this one. She was thrilled when it arrived! It's preschool thru 12th grade, the pages open as pockets to store papers and projects. Guided questions for her to fill out but also blank areas for her to draw or write.",5.0
This is awesome my girls both have one and love it. My 19 year old is jealous that she does not have one.,5.0
"I have the baby book version of this as well and I love it! It's a very compact way to organize photos, keepsakes, and milestones! And, nice-sized pockets hold extra photos and papers.",5.0

Love this! Cute and practical for organizing your keepsakes.,5.0
"These books are great.  The size was perfect, so plenty of items will fit throughout the years.  The amount of space is greater for the younger years and less for the older years, which is also fitting.  Very pleased!",5.0
beautiful book,5.0
"Was looking for a book/binder to write memories/attach photos for my daughters school years, just like I had when I was a kid. This is one perfectly girlie, well made, and even glittery on the front, with wonderful decorations throughout, questions for the little ones to answer to keep all those adorable thoughts and dreams written in one place! Will be ordered another one for my youngest daughter!",5.0
Both my daughter I in-laws loved this as a birthday gift.  Granddaughters are 5 and 7.,5.0
Very happy with the quality and details put into this book.  :),5.0
"This memory book is very nice and extremely thick. It is spiral bound, and the covers are strong. Every page is a pocket, which makes storing more than one or two pieces of artwork much easier. There are several pages for each grade until high school. The pictures in the book are girly but not over the top. It is large enough to fit a normal piece of paper into the folder without folding which was a big part of why I chose this one. I also like that it has pages for preschool, which is fun to keep artwork from that age. Overall, for the price, I was extremely impressed with this book, it will definitely make it through our daughters school years and keep everything organized!",5.0

I love the fact it has several pages for pre-k.  I also love on the cover you can add pictures of each year.  Extremely happy customer.  Recommend this book to everyone with my eyes closed.",5.0
this is perfect for anyone with a little girl! I am using the intro page to glue on her preschool pictures as well! LOVE IT! Also- mine didn't have any pictures of children in it- I saw that mentioned in one review. Just cartoon animals and hearts.,5.0
"Great memory album for school work.  Plenty of space provided for storing small art work, pictures, report cards and spaces to provide information on likes and dislikes each year.",5.0
"Loved it, very cute!!",5.0
Exactly what I was looking for. There is even a spot for the class pictures! There are four pages for each grade up to 8th grade and one page per grade in high school. My daughter won't start school for another 3 years but I bought the red one for my son and was so happy with it I couldn't risk them not having anymore when that time comes!,5.0
Wonderful quality book for keeping all of your schoolyears in order,5.0

Very cute. Super girly. Lots of pages to put pictures and pockets for awards and artwork.,5.0
I love this book. It is adorable. Maybe not ideal for once your daughter is in middle school and high school because it is very pink and little girlie looking. Every page is pocketed so you can put things in for storage. I bought one for each of my girls.,5.0
Great way to keep up with my daughters school stuff,5.0
A gift for my granddaughter and she loved it!,5.0

The book is just beauiful & my granddaughter is going to love it. Pink is her favorite color and this book is a pretty pink!!,5.0
Gave to my 9 yr old granddaughter who will be in 4th grade to start saving info.  She loved it and can put memories in it while she remembers kinder thru 3rd. Would recommend. Great gift.,5.0
This book is even prettier in person than it looks here. The price is well worth it and my great granddaughter loved it!,5.0
"Bought this for my 5 year old great niece for school year keepsakes, she immediately went through looking at the pages and asking what each said. She is excited about filling it up as she grows!",5.0
Lovely!! Can't wait to fill it with memories. Lots of pockets for the younger years. Looks sturdy but very pretty.,5.0

"This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted some way to keep track of special items and pictures for my girls during school. I also liked that this included several pages for Preschool, instead of just starting at Kindergarten. Very nicely made.",5.0
"great book, very cute and my daughter loves it. thank you. yeah! ok, see ya later alligator. bye bye bye",5.0
"Love this memory keeper.  I have the previous version for my older child and this one seems much more practical.  Same amount of pockets, just better memory prompts as you might call them for each grade.  Love all the pockets for memories and mementos.",5.0
"I bought 2 of these for my girls. I love them.

First, another reader noted that this memory book was not good for children of color because it was filled with pics of all caucasian looking children. Either the manufacturer changed the illustrations in the book or the reviewer was confused. The edition I have has NO pics of children or any living thing except a few scattered cute illustrations of cats.

Based on the photo slots on the cover you may think this book goes from K to 12, but the first few pages, to my delight, are dedicated to pre-K.

Every grade from pre-K to 7th grade has 2 pages (which is 2 pockets for papers/artwork) and 1 page to attach a pic/paper/etc.

Grades 8/9 and 10/11 get 1 page each which forms a pocket for those grades to share. Grade 12 gets 2 pages and its own pocket.

It's pink, girly, has plenty of pockets and space/fill-ins for information and I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I also posted some pics.",5.0
"this is just what i needed for my niece, she loves it. this is the second one i bought. great gift idea!",5.0
"I couldn't decide between this and a similar one in aqua, so I bought both.  This one is the ""Deluxe"" but I couldn't see a lot of difference.  However, I did think this was the cuter of the 2 for my girly-girl.  I love that you can put pictures in the cover, that the pockets hold a lot of stuff for each grade, and that the book is meant for the kids to contribute to, even at a young age (mine is in 1st grade).  Anyway, I love it, my daughter loves it, and we are having so much fun filling it out!",5.0
I love love love this book and will be getting another when my youngest daughter starts preschool!  I immediately started filling out pages and my oldest is only in 3yr old preschool!  I love the pockets in EVERY page!,5.0
I had a school years memory book growing up and I still like looking at it.  It was no where near as beautiful and fun as this one.  very complete - LOVE it!!,5.0
"Love this book.  Lots of room for stuff and very cute.  My 6 yr old loves it and there is space for pics,  artwork, her writing, etc.  Good purchase.",5.0
Just like the description. My daughter loves it! Would have been nice to have 2 pages each for the later years though.,5.0
"Great product, highly recommend. Great price and I got it on time. I love the pockets it has and a spot to write and place pictures from pre-k to 12th grade. I already filled out and added for pre-k and I look forward to pulling it out every year to fill it out.",5.0
"This was the first book I bought about quilts and I found the patterns really easy to make.
You can finish a wonderful quilt for baby in just a few hours.  It shows you how to cut and sew them, step by step, all the  materials you will need are listed in the fist pages, explains many things  about fabrics and color combinations for perfect results.
I made quilts  for my little queens, my dogs, and they LOVE sleeping there!",5.0
"If you need a great baby shower gift in a hurry, this is the book for you.  These quilts are quick, cute and easy.  Attractive novelty fabric is a must and the patterns are not brand new, but they are fun.  This is a great  book for your quilting library.",5.0
Great collection of easy and quick quilts to make for baby.,5.0
Some cute quilts in there,5.0
"Can't wait to get started making the quilts in this book, one down.....",5.0

"I bought this book when I first started quilting about 2000.  It was my ""go to"" book for a long time. I have made the quilts in this book over and over for dozens of people.  The patterns are very simple and good for beginning quilters.",5.0
I like to help my friends get started on their first quilt endeavors and this has become the favorite book to go to. I have several quilt  books however this always seems to be the book they choose for their first quilt. It has quite a few pretty patterns with a few fabric choices for each one. There is a list of supplies and fabrics needed at the beginning of each pattern and the instructions are easy to follow as well.,5.0
"I love this baby quilt book.  I have used it for years; so much I lost/misplace my 1st and bought a 2nd.

My favorite gift to give somebody expecting is a quilt to go with their nursery, this book handles every aspect of simple easy to be made tops in a day!  I have made from cutting to quilting and binding one of these in just 10 hours.  And the response to the person receiving is the best feeling in itself!

You will not be sorry if you are a beginner and just getting the hang of sewing the instrucstions are very detailed and explained very clearly.  I would consider myself an exper sewer and still enjoy it.  I make my own patterns and create a lot of quilts that way but this is easy peasy!

Enjoy!",5.0

"This book is not just for baby quilts----it provides an excellent view of how changing colors affects design.  I bought this book after seening it at a friend's, because its color photos provide incentives and a great source of previewing how to mix colors on one design to get very different and wonderful results.  Highly recommend.",5.0
"Easy instructions for cute, fast and easy quilts.  Great for a beginner or someone who has been quilting a while.  I would recommend this product.",5.0
"I love this book!  I haven't made anything from it yet, but I'm working up to it, by reading and perusing this book and others.  The quilts seem easy enough for a beginner, yet very interesting.  I love the fact that each quilt has two color options: bright or pastel.  I can't wait to get started!  I recommend this author and this book.",5.0
My wife used this book to make so many quilts it finally fell apart.  Great easy to use patterns she uses again and again.,5.0
"It is a nice book ... I don't make very many baby quilts ... but the few I do, I like this book because it is very simple.",5.0
"The quilts in here are beautiful. They are also pretty simple to make. The patterns can be done quickly and I'm a beginner quilter. Like other people mentioned, the pictures are very helpful in selecting fabric and they're big and glossy so it's easy to see what the quilt will turn out like. This is by far the best of the Quilts for Baby books that Ursula has published. I can't wait till she puts out another one.",5.0
I found that this collection of baby quilts offers the best options for simple quick quilts. I have always returned to this book everytime I make a baby quilt even though I have others to reference.,5.0
Book came on time and in good condition.  I'd buy from this seller again.,5.0
"I borrowed this book from the library twice in a row, and am finally buying one for myself.  Most of my books only get used once or twice, but I've made 5 of the projects from this book and don't see an end in sight.  Awesome presentation (fun to read and browse through) and good value (very versatile).",5.0
I love this book and have already made a baby quilt from it.  The instructions were great and easy to follow and the project did not take a long time.,5.0
"One of my most used quilting  books. I have made many of  the quilts and all the patterns were easy to follow. A first time quilter will find this book extremely helpful but all quilters will enjoy making these quick, easy quilts because they are perfect for baby quilts, beautiful as gifts and easy to enlarge.",5.0

"I got this as a gift for my daughter's baby shower and was so excited to use it. The directions say it's for infant to 12 year olds. That's a lie. My 14 month old lasted for 2 seconds with her hand in the goop before it was all over her legs, clothes and kitchen counter. I don't know of any child under 4 who can keep his/her hands perfectly still for a full minute. Do not waste your money on this!",1.0
"I think that in trying to make this kit cheaply, the manufacturer has made it almost impossible to get a good finished product.  I'm a teacher, and I'm familiar with doing crafts with kids.  It's taken three tries for me to get this thing done with a very patient and willing 6-year-old. Right not I'm waiting with baited breath to see whether or not the plaster came out too thin.  Extremely frustrating!!!",1.0
I purchased this mold kit in the store. I followed the directions and the gel set up before I even poured it into the mold. I contacted the company and NO RESPONSE. Now I have the plaster and no way to make the handprint. The last thing a company should do these days is ignore a customer's complaint. I guess I'll have to find something else to mold my daughter's hand and try the plaster like that.,1.0
"I tried to make a hand print with my 2 and a half year old.  What a disappointment!  The instructions say to keep the child's hand still in the gel for a minute until it sets up.  I don't know any toddler who can keep their hand still for 60 seconds.  Plus, do not touch the bottom of the pan.  The gel is < 1/2 inch thick, so it is almost impossible for a toddler not to push all the way through.  Needless to say the hand print was a disaster.",1.0
"The Colorbok 158721 Precious Hands Plaster Molding Kit (which is not what is currently pictured on this product page) was unusable. The cup that came with the kit was crushed, so I used an equivalent amount of water as directed. The gel was obviously too thin as it was supposed to just be in the middle of the mold but it was so runny it ran to the edge immediately. My daughter could not put her hand into the gel and not touch the bottom as instructed because it was so thin. She kept her hand in the gel for 10 minutes and it did not set up right so when she pulled her hand out, it just turned into a goopy mess. The color of the gel mixture was green instead of white. This stuff is plain awful.",1.0
"I have done two of these same brand kits in the past with my older child and they worked really well.  Like other reviewers have stated, something changed in the gel mix and now it doesn't work at all.  After reading the reviews, I thought I'd still risk purchasing it and that maybe people just weren't following the directions.  I followed them to the letter - exactly 6 ounces room temperature water added to the gel mix and it turns into a foamy pancake batter consistency, but doesn't set up AT ALL.  Even tried having my child sit for longer than the 1 minute and then blow-drying lightly on low temp to no avail.  The kit gel is nothing like it used to be when I did it with my older child a few years ago.  Buyer beware - not worth the money or effort.",1.0
Wish I read the reviews that this does not work....it doesn't.  The first step doesn't set up. I then made some play dough and made an imprint in that and then filled in the rest with the plaster.,1.0
"Bought this product 5 times in the past for making molds of kids hands and it was perfect, this time, and this is the second in two weeks the gel never set up and when I removed my kids hand it just turned to mush. Can't even say if the plaster works or not. I even bought a new kit on Monday (today is Wednesday) to see if it was just a bad batch, it wasn't same thing happened. I even tried different temp of water for gel.",1.0
"Wast of money! I've used kits like this before and they actually worked. I followed the directions for both kits and still didn't work.

The 3D gel never set up! After 10 minutes I threw the kit away, went to the next kit I bought tried using less water than was instructed and the gel again never set up!",1.0
Product never setup just as many others have stated in their review. After an hour the mixture is still like pancake battery.,1.0
"I have used this product many times and was pleased and the outcome are some of my most prized possessions, so what happened to the quality of this product?? I'm so NOT impressed!",1.0
"Do Not Purchase!!  Precious Hands Plaster Molding kit has apparently changed the gel used to make the initial hand mold.  New gel mix does NOT work.  This would have been my 8th year making a hand print of my daughter, however new mix would not solidify enough do make the actual mold.  Mold fell apart and was unusable.  Not sure why they ruined a good product.",1.0
Directions said add water but it didn't say how much. i added a little at a time and it looked fine in the package but when we poured it At first it was too thin so we let it set and then it just crumbled. Very disappointed.,1.0
Used to be a great product. Have done these before and it worked great. This time the gel took several minutes to set (supposed to be 45 seconds) and when the child removed hand the gel stuck all over the hand and destroyed the mold. Waste of money.,1.0
"This is my second kit.  The first kit (same Precious Hands brand) worked fantastically for us a few years ago - it's still hanging on the wall.  I have followed the instructions and know how it works.

This time, it didn't work.  This second try, a few years later, was awful.  It didn't gel up.  At all.  I don't know if they changed the mix or ratio, but this was a waste of money, and I wasn't even sure how to return the mess of goo that never did dry even after a day.  Something is wrong with this, so use due caution if you purchase it.",1.0
I love this...when it finally works. I used this on several children and you would have thought I bought stock in the company with how many extra I had to buy to get the gel to work. I always followed the instructions carefully. I do not know what I am doing wrong but am very frustrated with the gel in this product.,1.0
Beyond bummed. I used this same product 9 years ago for my oldest. But come this year i bought it for my youngest...the gel mold never set...ever. I followed the directions to a T and i was really bummed when it didn't work.,1.0
"This is our second one. The first went great, this one was a nightmare. After carefully measuring the water the gel would not harden. What a disappointment. The 3 year old cooperated well holding still for over 3 minutes. Even then there were elevated spots where the gel was still sticky. Big disappointment. Have no idea what happened maybe the company changed formulas to increase profitability. We will not buy any more of the Webster products. Have to voice our displeasure. With our wallet",1.0
"Don't waste your time. Didn't even get to the plaster part. Followed directions and gel didn't work. Lumpy, thin and runny, took several minutes to set. Horrible.",1.0
"Do NOT buy! I bought this at Hobby Lobby as a gift, watched the YouTube video on how to make it, and followed the instructions exactly. The gel did not keep my 2 year old daughter's handprint at all despite her holding very still until it was ""rubbery"" as the video said. Wasted time, effort, and money.",1.0
"cat lady.... it's amazing that you think because you succeeded with your pets, that ALL the MANY people who couldn't make it work, must be inept. I also followed the instructions carefully and it was also a complete fail. you shouldn't insult people's intelligence - sometimes there is truth in the mass responses.....  i would tell anyone interested in this product that you have a 10% chance it might work. MORE THAN LiKELY it WONT.",1.0
"I followed the directions exactly for the 3D gel.  Well, we never got to the plaster part, because the gel took over 8 minutes to harden.  It was too thin and filled the entire heart instead of just a small puddle, and my son held his hand in the gel for well over 45 seconds (a serious struggle for a 3.5 year old, but he did and was very still).  Gel finally started hardening a little around 8 minutes, so I tried it and it took my hand print ... but not nearly as nicely as in the picture ... probably because it took so long to begin firming up.  Saved the plaster, so maybe we'll try again.  But the gel definitely did not work as advertised.",1.0
"Got this to make a Mother's Day gift of my daughter's hand print for my mother and it didn't even work! I followed all the directions to a T and when I went to gently remove the dried plaster from the heart shaped tray, the entire thing crumbled in my hands like cake! I ended up just throwing it away! My time and money wasted!

You have to mix the gel in a bowl and you only have, they claim, 1 1/2 minutes before it gets firm around the child's hand, but it got hard a lot faster than that. Also, if you make a mistake or the child moves his or her hand, you can't redo it. Luckily, my daughter cooperated and we did get a decent print the first time...not that it mattered because the whole thing fell apart anyway. For $15 this is a complete waste of money. After the epic fail that is this kit, I found another kit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clay-Handprint-Footprint-Keepsake-Photo-Wall-Frame-Black/dp/B002PAV6T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clay Handprint & Footprint Keepsake Photo Wall Frame - Black</a>&nbsp;that was amazing! This kit required no mixing and was clay so if you made a mistake you can redo it. For $10 extra, this is a WAY better product and I'd recommend this one instead!",1.0
"We have two of these kits.  Unfortunately we never made it past the gel part.  First time my son squeezed his hands and the gel hardened.  Second one our 2 week olds feet didn't go deep enough because the gel spread out too thinly on the plastic heart.  Disappointing.  Great idea but poor gel.

If the company reads this post.  Raise the price by a dollar or two and add a second or even a third gel packet. Maybe even develop a clay that we could mold our children's prints into.",1.0
This product is very hard. I have twins that are 14 now and I did this with them but it took several kits. Now I have a two year old and I have had to buy 3 kits so far and no success. I will try a few mor times because I would like one for all three girls. It would be helpfull if they sold the gel separately.,1.0
"I bought this product as a gift for my in-laws since we do not have much money this year I figured it'd be a nice gift. I Read the instructions and it had a hint that if it is an infant or toddler, to do it while they're sleeping. Well my daughter is 2 and not very patient so I mixed the gel and stuck her hand in while she was asleep. The instructions say it will harder within 1- 1 1/2 minutes. I was standing there with her hand in the gel for WELL over 2 minutes. The gel would not harden. I finally got frustrated and took her hand out and the gel was still runny and was all stuck to her hand. The whole project was ruined and ended up throwing everything in the trash. This product is nothing but frustration and I wasted ten bucks, now have to think of a new idea for a gift. THANKS!",1.0
"We got this gift for her birthday & I'm ashamed to tell my friend that it was a flop. My daughter ia  well behaved child..sits through projects & is crafty. This gel mess was just that.... A big mess the mold suck to get hand....& was A waste of a bday present. We have made plenty of molds & this brand compares none!!!.. I will have to go out & buy stuff to make mold...my friend had great intentions,..the product- didn't! I want my gel replaced!",1.0
"Very difficult to achieve the mold, and then the plaster didn't fill in all areas, so i'm left with a partial, useless handprint. Complete waste of time and money.",1.0
This product is absolutely worthless.  I tried it on my six year old and four year old grandsons.  Even though I followed the instructions explicitly the plaster was too runny the first time and a thick glob the second time.  A total waste of time and money.,1.0
"After the fourth attempt and still no success, this product is absolutely terrible.  As other reviews have stated, if your child can not sit patiently with his/her hand/foot in in mold, then this will be a waste.  It took over a minute for the mold to dry... little toddlers and babies cannot sit still.  While they are sleeping?  Are they serious?  My 21 month old is a light sleeper, as soon as I picked up her hand she new!  What a incredible waste of time and money!!!",1.0
"Would NOT recommend this product. I recieved mine from a friend who couldn't quite figure it out. I got it, and it constantly skips stitches. Tried singer serger needles, which made the problem worse. Took it into a repair shop, and still does not work. Then, there is the tension issue. No setting seems to be right.",1.0
"I purchased this serger 2 years ago ... big mistake! The price was great and it was sewing just fine in the beginning. I changed it to 1 needle instead of 2 needles and it lost tension. No matter what I did, follow the manual, change the tension, put back the second needle it was getting worse. The only way I could use this serger it was actually on rolled hem but that didn't last for too long!!!
Really Do Not Buy it. I'm not a beginner .... I bough it to make my clothing line!!! I can't use it anymore because of the loose tension. I had it for about 2 years now and Useless!!!! I'm looking for a better one right now :)",1.0
"I bought this machine for $218 (that's with tax) at Walmart. I was super excited to start making some clothes for my 1 month old daughter. Every chance I got to work on this machine (wasn't very often) I was fighting with the tension. I did absolutely everything!!! (A great video on YouTube is ""taming your server"" watch that) After two weeks I decided to take it back. My boyfriend asked why I didn't let him try to figure it out. I said ""if I pay that much for something I better be able to figure it out on my own....it shouldn't be that hard"". And yes I did read ALL of the manual. This machine did NOT work for me....I would rate it lower than a 1 star if I could. I'm looking into the brother 1034d.",1.0
"build quality not so good... ive tried using this thing one more than one occasion, and the thread kept breaking no matter what i did..",1.0
"First off, I usually don't do online reviews but this machine has frustrated me so badly that I really felt the need to warn others. I have been sewing for a few years now and have become pretty good at it. This was my first serger and I was so excited to use it. The threading of the machine was not hard but I am here to tell you....that is the most and ONLY positive thing I can say. The tension settings on this stupid thing are so hard to get right. I messed with the tension for two days straight and after going thru a huge pile of scrap fabric, I decided to sell this thing and get me a brother. It is about the same price so I would definitely consider the brother over this piece of garbage. the thread was also constantly breaking in mid-project and would get tangled up. I was repeatedly unthreading and rethreading it. I thought maybe it was me but after reading the manual front and back along with several you tube videos....I am convinced it is the machine.",1.0
I have been sewing on a 20 year old Brother serger that broke in the middle of a project. I ran to Walmart and bought this Singer off the shelf out of desperation. At first I was impressed because it was really easy to thread - way quicker than my old Brother. The stitch looked nice but I was immediately concerned about the squeaky noises all the moving parts were making. It sounded very cheap. Then after about 20 minutes of sewing I heard a loud CLUNK and see that my right needle thread has broken. I try re-threading and it breaks again...I look inside to investigate and see the needles are scraping against the lower looper arm - which means that it had somehow gotten bent in the few minutes I had been using it. I looked at the loopers and the metal looked so thin I think I could have bent it with my finger. I will be taking this back to Walmart tomorrow for a refund. I am going to buy the Brother 1034D - it is comparable in price and has way better reviews.,1.0
"I purchased this model from Joanns 3 days ago. I have had years of experience with a 5-thread serger, so I know how a serger is supposed to work.  The swatch of material under the needle showed a perfect 4-thread stitch when it was set up, (right out of the box)and I attempted to stitch on the same swatch of material.  It was a mess.  After investing about 18 hours in trying to get this machine to sew (I had resorted to trying only 2 threads utilizing the spreader)I contacted Singer and was given various ""tips"" to try as the tension would not hold for over 10 stitches, then would loop-de-loop for a few stitches, and go back to serging properly for only a few stitches.  I was told it was a problem with the tension holding (yes, I knew that) and since it was under warranty I could take it to one of 2 dealers in the State, each dealer located approximately 2-1/2 hours away.

It is easy to thread, yes, but the light is a big problem.  It is an LED light and only if there is no other light source you can see to sew with it. Unless you sew in the dark, consider a different purchase.

After reading the reviews (which I wish I had done before purchasing this serger) I ordered a Brother1034D from Amazon.  I've used only Singer machines for the past 40 years, but after this experience I doubt I'll swear by the Singer Brand again.",1.0
"Bought this at Walmart thinking that being a Singer it should be a decent machine.  After a few days, thread got all tangled up inside which I can understand can happen. Problem is that the threading directions and pictures in the manual are so lame, and the color coding is a joke, so it was impossible to get it re-threaded.  Funny thing is it says right on the box that it is color coded for foolproof threading!  There is no color coding on the more detailed pathways the thread must take. I have been a dentist for 27 years and am used to detailed work (machine is for my daughter), but there is no way anyone can thread this machine using only the directions provided.  The manual does not even show enough detail to see where the thread is going.  I could not find any other directions online.  Very disappointed in Singer's lack of regard for the consumer.  Returned to Walmart and told manager to pull it from the shelves.",1.0
"I purchased this machine thinking it would live up to the Singer Name, (even purchased a gathering foot, which by the way no attachements come with this machine,) boy was I wrong, the first time I used a different setting on the tension for gathering it never worked right again, no matter how it was set. I contacted support and they told me that it could be due to using different brands of thread, or setting the tension differently, anyway I got the run around. I have been a professional seamstress for over 30 years and know how to set tension and know about quality thread. They also told me to get it corrected I would have to send it to a repair shop, keep in mind that this machine was less than three weeks old! It worked a total of about one week. So I boxed it up and returned it to Wal-Mart and ordered a EZ Lock and it is working beautifully! and guess what, you can use different brands of thread.",1.0
"I have been sewing most of my 56 years - started out standing at my mother's treadle machine before I ever started to school. I have had plenty of experience with both sewing and serging machines. I have been a loyal Singer user because I was always satisfied with the ease of use, and the value for the dollar...until I met this serger. I purchased it online through Amazon. I spend many more hours threading and rethreading this machine than I do sewing with it. Even tying on a new color of thread and pulling it through does not work with this machine. Every color change of thread, I spend at least an hour trying to get all the spools to work together. The thread breaks constantly, and I cannot count the number of broken or bent needles I have had sewing nothing heavier than cotton quilting squares. I kept thinking I had to be doing something wrong, but according to the manual and DVD the machine was set up correctly. Do not depend on the manual or DVD to explain how to set the tensions though - nowhere does it tell you the difference in the needle tension controls and the differential feed tension. That is all guess work.

After dealing with this nightmare for a year now...I am ready to simply throw it in the trash and find a better serger. Singer lost a long time customer with this piece of junk. I could not even attempt to regain any of my costs by selling it somewhere like eBay because my conscious would not allow me to pass this machine along to another innocent user.

Steer clear of this serger, it is not worth the price no matter how good the value seems.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singer-14SH6540-Differential-Feed-Serger-Sewing-Machine/dp/B00005NWQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singer 14SH6540 Differential Feed Serger Sewing Machine</a>",1.0
"I bought this machine from Joann's and it wouldn't sew a tight stitch at ALL.  The seam would pull apart, revealing about 1/2 inch of thread (on the OUTSIDE of the garmet).  I played with the tension for hours but it didn't do any good.

On top of that, the light bulb started flickering about 30 minutes into sewing (no, not sewing. . . ""trying"" to sew).  Eventually the light just went out.  If you tapped the side of the machine where the light is, it would flicker on for a split second before going out again.

So, I took the machine back for an exchange.  This one actually sews quite well. . . but the light went out after about 30 minutes.  What's worse is that the manual says NOTHING about how to replace the light.  I unscrewed the casing where the bulb is, but the bulb appears to be BUILT INTO the machine.  It's not like any bulb on a sewing machine that I've ever seen!

I wrote Singer an email, asking how I'm supposed to change the light. . . waiting on a reply.  I'd stay away from this machine for a while.  I've a feeling they're going to be put on recall soon.",1.0
"i ordered this exact serger through ebay, the bulb was busted and it didn't sew very well no matter how much i tried to work with the tensions.  the seller was great and sent me a new one right away, the exact model.  the serging is ok right out of the box, but if you change the threads and have to adjust the tension, forget it.  the serging is terrible.  i think the tensions in these machines are not very good quality, honestly, i don't know what its problem is.  it's become very frustrating working on it for hours, reading and rereading the instruction manuel, and threading and rethreading.  well, i'm on my way to the sewing repair shop!",1.0
"I have been using a similar priced brother serger for years and when it broke I couldn't find it in my town so i purchased this singer machine.

I am returning it tomorrow.

i am rather good at threading sergers and have used many other models besides my own with no dificulties (its still a pain though).  but this machine makes it as dificult as possible.

the #1 & #2 threads go through these loops that they seem to come out of pretty easily while the machine is in use.

the #3 & #4 thread that go through the needles could not be harder to thread.  the machine has an arm that sticks out just to the right of the needles (it is for the cutting blade i believe) which makes it nearly impossible to thread with your right hand.  and even while threading with your left the arm blocks most of your view.  making this very dificult.

the tension dials already began slipping from the factory setting after no more then 10 min of use and had to constently be adjusted to keep them at the right tension.

i did like how the threading instructions were very well marked on the machine (although a very important part for thread #2 was left off the drawing which makes it inoperable without this one instruction which you do find in the manual).  i also liked how the tension was clearly marked on the machine.  but after 10 min of use those settings were already wrong.

the machine itself does not feel as quality as the similar Brother 1034D model.  at first i thought the threading looked easier but after threading it several times it in fact is much more time consumming and much more dificult.  the machine also sergers at a slightly slower pace.

i am very disapointed with this machine and will be returning it and ordering the Brother 1034D instead.  that seems to me to be the best machine for the cost (although once the coil inside stretches it is not repairable (says the guy at the repair shop).  although i had the same machine for 4 years and i used it on a daily basis for my evening business.  so it got lots of use.  after the 1st year i had to baby the tension but it still worked!).",1.0
"I bought this item at Walmart for $229 and was excited to begin sewing my first project.  That was a huge mistake.  The thread kept popping out of the tension on #3 no matter what I did.  I tried tightening it several times, went back to directions repeatedly looking for what I could have done wrong, though everything appeared to have been done correctly.  To finish the initial project I was sewing I ended up having to hold thread #3 by hand to create the right tension to finish sewing.  Thank goodness for dexterity!  The other major problem I had was the machine jumped around a lot on my sewing table as it sewed.  It didn't weigh enough to hold it in place, nor were there any suction cups on the bottom to keep it stable.  I ended up having to chase the machine down while I was holding thread #3!  I'm sure it all looked quite comical, but it was WAY too much of a hassle for me.  I returned the item to Walmart, got my money back and went to a local sewing shop and found a Janome serger that didn't cost too much more.  The Janome threads beautifully with perfect tension and has little suction feet to hold the machine in place while sewing.  Going from the Singer to the Janome in the same day made it very clear to me what a cheap piece of junk the Singer is.  As a side note, I asked the repairman at the sewing shop about the Singer and he says he won't carry them anymore because they break too often.  3 Months later and I haven't had a single problem with my Janome!",1.0

This is a cheap case and a total waste of money.  Basically a big plastic box with a handle.  The machine bounces around inside.,1.0

"My husband bought this sewing machine for me for Christmas.  I was very excited to receive it.  The first time I got it out to use it, it jammed, the thread tangled, the needle bent, and the zig-zag stich would not work.  Eventually I discovered the pattern module was in wrong from the factory, which caused the zig-zag stich not to work.  I also realized that the reason it was jamming was that the thread was catching on the broken bobbin holder.  My husband and I brought the machine to a professional repair shop to have them look at it, and the owner said that the bobbin holder was not lubricated, and one of the parts was assembled incorrectly.  He recomended that we return it.  We followed his advise, and since we pay close attention to the reviews that other people give on these sights, decided to warn everyone else about how severely dissapointing this machine is.  In general, this machine is poorly made, the instruction manual is useless, and we expected much better from a Singer.",1.0
"We saw this advertised, and thought ""Wow, what a deal...""

First machine we received?  Timing was off, would NOT sew-- threads would not lock together---- so we returned it.

Second machine we received?

Halfway thru a seam, the presser foot stopped advancing, stitch length got really small, and fabric kept puckering.

In both cases, we spent time on the phone with Simplicity representatives, who eventually said that our machines had to be defective, as they had ""no idea"" why it wasn't working.

I'm glad other people have had pleasant experiences...

We're going to return the second one, and take a look at other makes/models.  This has left a bad taste in our mouth.",1.0
I bought this for my daughter based on the many good reviews. But when I received it I was disappointed in how cheap the plastic was. Some parts were just waiting to break! I didn't have to even try it before I shipped it back. Not even the free patterns and free shipping (which I lost for returning it anyways) could convince me. I spent a little more money and bought a Janome. You get what you pay for most of the time!,1.0

"I have owned a portable top-of-the line Singer sewing machine for 35 years and loved it.  When it broke, I of course wanted another Singer.  I have been greatly disappointed in this model.  It doesn't have the ""solid' feel of my other one.  Everything is plastic and the light weightness of it made it feel cheap.  The light did not illumine the entire sewing area and the large neck made it difficult to locate and lift the presser foot.  But what caused me to return it is that it did not sew consistently.  I sewed an item with it and it worked okay.  Then I changed thread, and the bobbin thread would not pick up and I found the enclosed pamphlet stating that this machine required concise threading to work right.  After a frustrating time of trying to find the ""right"" way to thread it again, it finally worked.  When I changed the thread the next time,  the same thing occurred and I had threaded it exactly according to how I had threaded it when it worked.  Talk about a frustrating day!  It works and then it doesn't.  It might be a defective machine, but if this is typical of the ease of using it, I don't want to deal with it and will get something else.",1.0
"Can't believe Singer would put their name on this machine!  Plastic pieces galore, all too easy to break.  The noise alone requires ear plugs!  After reading the reviews, obviously unexperienced with quality sewing machines, I thought I was getting a gem.  Turned out to be a piece of dung.  Now I have to pay a hefty return fee.  Don't buy this product!!!",1.0
"Well, in the beginning it must have been ""dumb luck"", because, after a few successful hemming tries, I recently tried simple repair to seams, straight stitching, and the bobbin is jamming up the works.  I cannot seem to adjust the bobbin tension to the slight change in fabric and the insturctions are no help.  After hours and hours of trial and error, I have given up.  My 30 year old singer sewed rings around this one for ease of use. I caution you, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to  adjust this machine's numerous dials from one project to another. -- And the instructions and video are no help for simple sewing --",1.0
"This machine was broken when received and I can see why.  They make the parts out of plastic!  How easily they break apparently.  If you want a cheaply made machine, buy this one.  I sent mine back.",1.0
"I have nothing against this product, but SIX of these 14 reviews are BY THE SAME PERSON.  This unfairly pads the results and gives a false impression of the product, rather than providing helpful information.  It's great if a customer is enthusiastic, but when s/he misuses the review system to hype a product, that's not so great.",1.0
"When my two daughters spent their hard earned money on this toy, they were so excited. When we got it home and put it together, they were very disapointed. The ""stickers"" that came out were bumpy and when you peeled the backing off, the sticker part came off too. They were left with a picture that had some clear tape on top of it. This is a very frustrating and disapointing toy.",1.0
Broke on the first week. Bought a pair of Singer scissors that are much better.,1.0
These broke within 6 months.,1.0
These are soooooo cheap! Do not buy. I work with kids one day a week and our pairs were probably used a dozen times. Today I had FOUR pairs break while kids cut yarn!!! Ridiculous and dangerous. I want a refund or at minimum a replacement.,1.0
"Terrible scissors. I received the scissors but they're terrible, my kid can't use them and even for me is hard to open and close.",1.0
"I bought these at a local box store. These scissors were a total waste of money as they broke during the very first use due to a serious design flaw.  See that plastic circle at the hinge where a nut used to be located? It's now molded PLASTIC which is NOT a metal nut and easily breaks!  When shopping for scissors make sure there's a METAL screw and a METAL nut for the hinge. I'm very disappointed, Fiskars used to be better than this!",1.0
Absolute junk.  The hinge is a plastic piece that breaks after very little use (see photo).  You would be better off buying scissors from the dollar store.  It is kind of sad to see a brand name like Fiskars selling cheap crap like this.,1.0
"I bought Fiskars scissors because I thought they were reliable quality, but they broke while cutting a piece of string, after I'd only had them for a few weeks. The plastic handle snapped at the rivet, making them completely useless. These scissors are not worth the price premium; might as well buy the cheapest ones, since these broke anyway.",1.0
Wasn't happy not being able to pick a color and ordered these for my sons school supplies. Of course the color received was pink. Really doesn't make sense that you wouldn't send gender neutral colors if you're unable to pick colors.,1.0
"Cheap quality, fell apart after using 3 times",1.0
"At the end of every paper cut, it leaves a sideways tear in the paper, because of the poor design of the shape of the tip. My friend has a 99 cent pair of chinese scissors that work a lot better. Fiskars used to be good, now they are trash. I can't believe they tricked $7 out of me... don't make the same mistake !@#%!!!",1.0
Received scissors more then 2 weeks after I ordered them.  The scissors are not the same quality as the ones this company advertised.  I already had a pair like the ones I ordered so it was easy to see that the ones I ordered and the one I received were not the same type.  Not happy with this company and would like a refund.  I will be happy to return for a full refund and free return shipping.  We'll see how professional their customer service department is.,1.0
"We ordered this table for my 2 year old son's Chirstmas gift, since he was receiving  a Thomas train set.  Hight adjustment and side drawers looked perfect.  However the top part of the table was already broken in the box.  It looks very thin and fragile, so we returned it and bought a different train table.  I doubt how long it would last even if we got an unbroken one.",1.0
"... because it arrived broken. Whoever assembled it managed to torque the screws on the thread guide bar so tight that the rather flimsy spool stand attachment cracked. This may be a better 'live' purchase, I wouldn't advise buying this online.",1.0
"the problem starts with The manual for the Euro-Pro serger Model 534DX, from it, no one can understand how to thread the BOTTOM LOOPERS.
The manual was written by someone other than English speaking as obvious by the paragraph titled ""How to use the Lower Looper Automatic Threader (For certain type only)"".
The diagrams for the Automatic threader do not continue from the previous diagrams for the lower loopers.
Their manual offers 24 hour support, but the 800 telephone number (800-798-7398) goes straight to India, where a man tells you he can't answer your question, his English barely understandable.
He also gave me another 800 number(800-361-4639), that only gives you a busy tone.
Also part of their telephone support machine tells you go visit their Web site, but is so incoherent that I had to search the Internet to get the correct spelling.
then to add insult to injury, their Web site only deals with Vacuum Cleaners, not sergers.  I wonder why??
I also called HSN, where I purchased the serger, and their Customer Service person could only help me by giving me a non 800 telephone number (517-842-8691), where ""people who cant get through on the 800 number have better luck getting through"".
Unfortunately, there is no such number.
So with 5 xmas gifts to sew and no answer for ONE LITTLE QUESTION, ""HOW DO YOU THREAD THE BOTTOM LOOPERS CORRECTLY""?
and one expensive paper weight serger, I rate it as useless!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
This product is no good. Did not transfer at all. The one for dark fabric is rotten also. Don't waste your money on it. These should not be on the market!! A total waste.,1.0
"I made a tote bag with my family's pictures on it. It printed really nice and was great looking when I gave the gift. The first time it was washed, you could no longer tell the people's pictures. It was gently washed, but it didn't handle it well.",1.0
"Please go buy another product.  If you want to do iron-on transfers, there are MUCH better options than this one.  First complaint: the ""clear"" portion of the iron-on quickly turns a shade of ""cream"" the moment you finish ironing it in place.  Second: it looks and feels like you have ironed a place-mat to the shirt, which then quickly wrinkles, fades, and peels off, even after just the first wash.  Third: the iron-on does not stretch with the shirt behind it: it cracks! If you purchase or use this item, I guarantee you disappointment.  I have tried it three miserable times, and would never in this lifetime use it again on anything I intended to wear or give as a gift. I am throwing away my remaining sheets.",1.0
"When you iron on the design, the transfer paper is clear.  After washing it, it turns white, so it stands out.  After one washing (cold water, inside out, low heat in the dryer),  my transfers started to crack.  After a second washing, they further cracked and started to peel all throughout.",1.0
"I ironed and ironed and ironed--but still the transfer would not stick. I held the iron down so long I was afraid I'd scorch the shirt. I not only wasted the money on the transfers, but the shirts I tried to iron them on are ruined.",1.0
Terrible product. There are no instruction to flip the image even on their own website. Waste of money.,1.0
We've done dozens of t shirt transfers before but these kept coming out with odd colors when we completed the transfer.,1.0
"I followed the instructions exactly, and everything looked promising. The parts that did not have printer ink on them pressed on clearly, but turned white after washing and the design on one of the shirts got completely ripped after the shower. Wasted money, ink, and water and I had to wash each shirt individually. Save your money and go get professional screen printing or find something better.",1.0
"If I could give this less than a star I would...considering it did not work at all. I've printed transfers and created shirts before and never had an issue. When trying to print on this transfer paper, I can't even explain how bad it was. It was like little smeared chunks of ink sliding off of the page. I tried printing in black and white - it was like it was random pieces/chunks of ink barely clinging onto the page. I tried several different print settings and variations, and finally was honest with myself that there was nothing that could be done on this product.",1.0
This stuff is no good I wasted 3 shirts trying to get it to work,1.0
"Bought other iron-on brands and never had a problem. Followed instructions to a tee and after using them, the product bubbled immediantely and peeled off. Horrible. Would never buy again.",1.0
"The new ones bleed after being set when they're sprinkled with water.
Very disappointed, and these never used to have this problem.",1.0
Bought this and even expedited the service and it was horrible quality. This was my second time trying it and it was just as disappointing as the first.,1.0
i followed the direction and it peel after the second day i wore it,1.0
I put these on as directed. I was very careful about it as these were supposed to be Christmas presents. After 4 hours (not even a wash!) the transfer was pretty much all worn off the shirt. I had also purchased quality t-shirts as recommended on the product. This was a total waste of money.,1.0
Didn't print really well. The color would go out in 2 week. I even washed it inside out hoping the color would stay on for a long period of time.,1.0
Leaves a rough texture that makes the print look like a cheap sticker. The colors are extremely muted and the quality is not good at all.,1.0
I found these hard to use especially since it ate up a couple printers with the gel coating on the transfers that the designs go on. The transfers in my inkjet while printing started smoking,1.0
I bought these transfers on 4 - 20 - 2017. I packed them away and didn't use them until this month. Well I bought six shirts and I applied all six transfers after one where they all cracked. I couldn't figure out why until I looked at the date on the transfers it said 10 - 4 - 2016. They sold me old transfers. So I lost the money for the transfers and for all six shirts I purchased that look like crap. Very pissed off customer.,1.0
Didn't work,1.0
It is close to impossible to find an inkjet printer these days. I had no idea it mattered what kind of printer you needed for these things - definitely my bad for not reading the reviews first. This will NOT work in any other kind of printer. It will melt and waste the pages you spent money on.,1.0
Don't buy this product. Despite carefully following the instructions the transferred image peeled and lifted at the edges of a t shirt after one low temp wash. The image also cracks with the slightest amount of movement of stretch.,1.0
Did not work,1.0
When you try to peel it from the paper it just rips. Then when i finally got one done it melted to the shirt. Do not buy.,1.0
"I've never used this brand before bit thought I'd give it a try. MISTAKE!! Not even a hour after wearing, it started to peel, I plan on trashing the rest so I don't waste any more shirts.",1.0
I purchased this to use with my Cricut Explore Air 2.  I printed on the paper and then used my Cricut to cut out the design.  The backing WILL NOT peel off. Maybe I got a bad batch of these but it was horrible.  Would not recommend for Cricut users.,1.0
"These did not work well for me at all. Still not sure what I did wrong, followed directions to the letter. I put print outs on small white cotton canvas totes and they came out terribly. Extremely disappointed.",1.0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,1.0
"Edit: I left the t shirt on sofa for 2 days coz I dunno if I should just discard it or what. So I gave it a last chance : I tried to peel it off. And surprisingly, the image stayed! Just that the edge was not really settled in and so we were actually peeling the ""iron on"" along which gave us the impression that it wasn't ironed on.
**on the very first day we did cool it down until the tee was cool to touch, no more heat. So probably we just gotta wait longer like few hours or 1-2days?

This is is wasted, I'll try washing in and see how would the image stay, and probably give it another try

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Followed all the steps but it just doesn't work.
Can't be transferred to 100% cotton tee... even though we have ironed way extra minutes than instructed. it's so disappointing..
I was customizing a tee for my daughter's birthday but it just couldn't work. :(",1.0
What a mess,1.0
The edges raised immediately even after proper application. Won't by again.,1.0
"After the first day.... never again was the image the same.
Did not last one single wash.
100% unhappy",1.0
"BEWARE... Package of transfers is out of date...Even if they're still usable, it should have been disclosed.",1.0
"These might be OK, but amazon sent me expired product. There is an expiration date on them that was 2 months prior to me trying to use them.
The end product was mediocre with a little trouble getting the edges to adhere to the fabric.",1.0
Poor quality. Transfer did not completely stick to t-shirt. Most of the transfer came off after a few hours. Very disappointing.,1.0
I ordered the wrong product.,1.0
"Doesn't stick well and it doesn't show.
Complete crap",1.0
"I wanted to use these to make shirts with my Logo on them for my husband and I for when I do craft shows.

FAIL. big time.

I followed the instructions and even printed off a page to practice on a piece of fabric (The 4x4"" piece worked WONDERFULLY) So I tried my full page logo. Read the instructions one more time just for good measure, noting that ironing time for a full page should take about 3 minutes. An hour and a half later, I'm still struggling to get an edge, any edge, of the paper to peel off of the plasticy stuff that the transfer is made out of. I finally get one edge to peel off and the transfer tears in the middle. I carefully place the bit that tore back on the shirt and iron over it again. Finally success! sort of. the edges that I painstakingly ironed with all of my weight against it are still peeling and frayed.
My 2 shirts are currently in the wash, by themselves, on cold and I'm not expecting much when they come out.",1.0
"I printed first on a sample page and the printing worked great! Then I printed on the transfer paper and it melted into the printer. Tried several times and every time it happened. Maybe this is an issue with my printer, an HP Laserjet but if that is the case, it should be clearly stated by Avery.",1.0
No matter where I printed this the ink melted onto the printer!,1.0
"Loved the ideas, followed the directions exactly but the transfer didn't last more than a few hours. I didn't think to create a separate image for the pockets and thought for sure that would be the area to peel, the corners peeled first. I made sure I concentrated on the edges most of all with no luck. I got a few nice pics but will not use this product again.",1.0
Started to peel off less then 2 hours after applying. I would not waste my money. I wish I could give it no stars!,1.0
"I love all of Avery's other products. But these just don't work. The process is easy enough, but the results were just sad. The transfer felt like paper, after washing the color faded, and the final product had no 'give' so the tiniest stretching caused the transfer to tear. Look into Photo Paper Direct in England...I had better luck with their products. Sorry Avery :(",1.0
SUCKS!!!!,1.0
Does not print very well. I ordered 2 because you only get 5 per package. Expensive for what you get especially with the poor quality. I have a high end printer so I know that is not the issue. I will not order again.,1.0
"Terrible , and leaves a film on the shirt",1.0
"I have used other brands, and never had this problem. Waste of money.",1.0
Horrible! Only got 1 transfer paper and 6 instruction sheets. The package should have had 6 iron on papers. VERRY DISAPPOINTED!,1.0
"Horrible.  Followed instructions to a t. Washed them, garbage. Peeled, wrinkled looking. Total waste of money.",1.0
Bleeding ink on first day. Used manufacturer ink. Tshirt ruined.,1.0
"Did not hold any ink on the paper, and I tried it with multiple inkjet printers. The ink just smeared everywhere as it printed. Very disappointed.",1.0
These transfers for light are horrible! The back does not peel off. I could not use a single one. You can use the transfers made for dark instead. They work great. The backing must be thicker.,1.0
"Very bad quality transfers. Wasted so much ink before I realized it was the paper, not the printer. Bubbles and peels, is very thin. I can't imagine it lasting through washes.",1.0
Will NOT show up on dark clothes.  Instructions need to be improved greatly.  Should include temp of iron.  Nothing in the drawing that is white shows up.,1.0
Poor color quality after printing and washes out.  Did not iron on well either.,1.0
"Did not work as easily as described... I made it work, but it took a lot",1.0
No matter what colors I print on these the result ends up turning really yellow after ironing.,1.0
These were the worst t-shirt transfers ever. When tried to use they would stick or stay on after applied. They were supposed to be white but they came clear.,1.0
"I've used many iron-ons over the years, and these are by far the worst. The images ended up bubbled or ripped no matter what I did. After ruining two onesies and three shirts, I bought a different product.",1.0
"Followed directions perfectly and the designs peeled off after one wash. Save yourself some time and frustration and just use the dark transfers from Avery. They work great on any fabric, light or dark. Only difference is that they have a white background rather than clear. Oh, and they actually work--that's different.",1.0
Did not last after the first wash. I did 6 shirts and all 6 of the transfers are coming off.  I washed them in my high efficiency washer which is easy on clothes.  Very disappointed in the product.  Not even close to what I expected,1.0
I could have done this wrong (although I followed the directions!) but when I washed the shirts and wore them the transfer cracked and peeled off.,1.0
It came out ok but started to come off after the first wash. Don't buy!,1.0
Way to complicated to work with,1.0
I am not happy. This came off almost immediately.,1.0
"The transfers done daily hold ink from the printer without melting. They also take a long time to iron-on, even with the correct temperature and heavy pressure. They were stiff even after being dried. I don't recommend them for t-shirts.",1.0
"Bad Quality Product, it comes out in pieces",1.0
Washed and dried garment without fabric softener prior to applying the transfer.  Looked good until first wash....peeled! Badly!,1.0
"This did not work at all. I followed the directions properly and ended up with a nice design on the shirt after I ironed it on and let it cool. But once I put it in the washer on low, it cracked and the design (which was the Nike swoosh) faded into the shirt I had bought at Forever 21 for over $15.00. I'm pretty sure I will never buy any transfer papers ever again. I'd rather just buy a shirt with the graphic I want on it. DO NOT BUY THIS. (However bad the outcome was, I did receive it earlier than I expected it to come. But I was NOT satisfied with this product.)",1.0
Colours leak into fabric. I tried these after having huge success with the the Dark Iron Ons.,1.0
Tried two sheets and it did not work as expected. I'm returning it hope to get my money back and will be doing my sons birthday shirt at a shop.,1.0
"Wasted several shirts with this product. Followed directions and put heavy pressure on the print. Didnt matter, it peeled up and cracked after one wash. Dont bother. And If you have a shirt that looks okay its still subpar and people can tell you did it yourself.",1.0
"Transfers sometimes, and sometimes not. Also leaves a shiny coating over transfer that does not blend well w fabric.  Stretchy fabric (like T-shirt) cause transfer to mis-shaps, crack or peal off.

update:
after one machine washing, they are falling off in pieces - now I have wasted time and money on these poor quality transfers AND the shirts I ironed on to. Big disappointment!!",1.0
"Two things I didn't like:

-The software/program that you can download via their website for this item did not have the option to flip the design (so your letters would not read backward).  I had to use Word to flip the letters.
-The instructions recommends to wash the item once so the shirt can be softer, but instead it just ruin the whole thing.

I guess this is not bad for one time use items or pictures that doesn't require flipping.",1.0
None of the prints worked -- disappointing.,1.0
Transfer is not very bright and takes a really long time to do if you have a good number of shirts.  I would recommend buying the transfers for dark material (even though it's usually more expensive) no matter what color your shirt is.  It's more of a printed adhesive sheet rather than a color transfer and comes out much nicer and brighter.,1.0
"Not only did the package show up over a week late, but almost all of the pieces of paper had black smudges on them. Very disappointing.",1.0
"The colors fade, the transfers peel and crack. Not recommended.",1.0
"This product was a total waste of our money, times 2 because it ruined the t-shirt we bought too.  We followed the directions exactly and the entire transfer turned a creamy burnt color as soon as we ironed it on.  We were using a white t-shirt, so the discoloring was really obvious.  When finished it was also stiff and ""plastic-y"" and looked really cheap.  I would never use this product again.",1.0
Awful!  Melted when I printed them out.  Used the same printer as another brand and had no issues.  Total waste!,1.0
"I normally buy my iron-on transfer paper from Michaels or Hobby Lobby but I was in a rush and picked these up! I used everything as directed! I printed my image like normal and the smallest touch of my nail or scissors and it scratched my image!! After the first scratch I thought ""ok, no big deal a little mess up!"" As I kept cutting.....if the scissors touched the image it added more damage! I honestly have printed two pictures and tried cutting both and both got scratched! My image wasn't even a very detailed cut, simple a Mickey head, lol. This product is awful and a waste of time and money compared to other iron-on transfers ive bought!",1.0
"I have used these transfer sheets before, with great results.  However, this was NOT the same.  I printed the image on my printer, per the usual.  I pre washed and pre ironed like the instructions say.  I used a cotton pillow case and a dry, hard surface.  i pressed with two hands on an iron on the cotton setting, without water.

As i said, I have used these before with ease and great end products.

This time, no matter what setting I set my printer to, the image was pale, dull in colour.  Then when i went to iron it onto a 100% cotton, prewashed and ironed shirt, the paper refused to peel away from the transfer.  My husband tried, I tried, we just tried anything we could think of.  Nothing would make the paper release from the transfer.  We had to scrub the paper off with a wet wash cloth.  The transfer was dull, just bad colour quality.

Bottom line is that, I don't know what happened to this particular batch of iron on transfer sheets, but I will not buy Avery brand anymore.",1.0
"The clear transfers are extremely had to transfer, especially lettering.  I have spent more than 2 hours pressing a date onto a quilt and it still isn't totally transfered.  I am not sure if there is a better way, expecially if you want particular lettering.  The delivery etc. was extremely high as usual from Amazon, but I would personally think twice about using them again.",1.0
"I wasted all of these because it wasn't clear that you need to flip the image. I have done many of these fabric transfers, and I had a different similar light fabric transfer
(Jolee's Boutique Easy Image Iron-on Transfer...) and this was just horrible.

Not only did I waste the paper on this but when printing on a huge Ricoh printer in my office, the paper snagged through the middle and left a huge line on every sheet.",1.0
"The paper jammed in the printer. Apparently, inkjet and laser jet are not the same. I realize that is my problem for not knowing, but who has inkjet printers? The ink for them is so expensive that most people have laser jet! I wasted 2 papers because they got destroyed running them through the printer.",1.0
"Used it on yellow and tan tee shirts. Left a white background area, a sort of 'halo' around iron-on.
Many years ago I used these with good results, I suspect Avery manufacturing has gone Chinese. These are not cheap either. I recall getting a ten pack of these for $8.99 about 10 years ago. Now they cost much more.
If you want to do transfers, try something else. I have done a lot of these, this is not a good product.",1.0
These are hard to get to stick and don't stay on well after even one wash.  not worth it.  Pay on online company to do it for you.,1.0
I just wanted to iron on some letters. This was a terrible solution. It didn't last. You could see the background paper. No way.,1.0
I opened the sealed package and there are blue dots or splotches all over the sheets. It almost looks like someone dripped ink all over the sheets so they aren't useable. Unfortunately I bought these a couple months ago and only opened the package today. This is just a warning to open the package ASAP and check so that Amazon can replace it for you.,1.0
I follow the directions and it still turns up cheap. I need at least a semi professional looking shirt... I even washed it before use and it will just crack on the shirt. What if I'm doing it wrong? Regardless even after I take a fresh sheet out of the box the paper has little scratches in it so when I go to transfer you see those scratches. I can't work with this.,1.0
very poor transfer paper if i could give it 0 stars i would have i made about 4 shirts with this and i should of just tested it on one when i saw the shirts i was really excited with how then turned out however after the first wash they were pretty much garbage the transfer were already crumbling and color was fading and i only had them for 1 day terrible product i recently bought espon transfer paper and so far that seems much better,1.0
I've tried using this product twice now and I had trouble getting the release paper off and made a big mess. The small size like this apparently came with the wrong instructions but the instructions with this larger size wasn't a whole lot better. I had no luck with it maybe it's my iron but I'm giving up trying maybe you will have better luck then me.,1.0
"I don't usually do product reviews but was so angered by this product that I just had to write something. I ended up ruining 3 items that i was trying to iron some words onto because once i ironed the printed sheet onto the fabric, I couldn't peel it off!! It reminded me of when i try to take off a price tag but half of it ends up sticking to the item and then you have to get ""goo-gone"" to get it off. So I had to get a wet washcloth and scrub off the backing which revealed the letters I wanted to show but then it had a white halo around the words... ugh - it was horrible. My cloth envelopes I was trying to label look horrible, at the very best. I am still trying to find a way to salvage them.

I am not sure what i will buy now but to be sure i will not be using this again!!",1.0
"Do your homework, read reviews before buying T-shirt transfers and find some that work.  The Avery brand transfers do not work.

I would have given it zero stars if that were possible.",1.0
"I made some t-shirts for work with these transfers.  Upon finishing them, i noticed there was a slight yellow tint to the transfers that were placed on white t-shirts.  Also, upon washing the ones placed on light colored tshirts, the color faded so bad that you could see where the transfer was cut. I was disappointed in my tshirt that had a white ""patch"" on the front with my design.

I was initially disappointed to see it uses twist-locks on the legs, but I thought it would only be an annoyance.  Wrong.  Despite being careful/gentle with my twists, the 2nd time I used it and tried to collapse the legs when done, I needed to use pliers to loosen the twist-lock on one leg.  And now, a month later pliers wouldn't even work to loosen and collapse TWO of the legs.

Note: Prior to this one I had the lighter weight version that used cam click locks for the legs.  I loved that one, but I lost it somehow and THOUGHT I'd be upgrading to get this heavier-duty version.  Boy was I wrong.",1.0

Now we're back to leaning the board up against the kitchen counter with me sitting on the floor.  It was a complete waste of money!",1.0
"Flimsy and awkward design. The lower legs are thinner which throws off the balance of the unit. Had to hold my whiteboard while writing just to keep it from wobbling. Also the legs lock by twisting the leg itself, not the ring as one would think. The leg slipped a few times. Overall, this is just not a sturdy product and for almost $50, I think it ought to be.",1.0

VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.

"This tool is light-weight, durable, convenient and easy to store in the vehicle and use. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality level of all aspects of the little portable vacuum.

It plugs into the car cigarette lighter. After 15-20 minutes of being on continuously, the motor was not hot, actually...no heat at all....and THAT is surprising! All parts and attachments assemble together very easy, and all attachments STAY together even during vigorous usage.

The small brush easily gets between the seat and door posts where theres not much room, even for a hand. It picked up everything off the carpet and off the floor mats. It has a brush attachment that really works, and a crevice tool attachment that works well in the seat crevices. It also has a hose attachment which works well and appears to be very durable.

The front stays secured during usage and easily detaches for emptying the dirt out and then is easily re-attachable after emptying.  Everything, including cord and attachments, easily goes into the carrying/storage bag when finished using.  The case is nylon and durable. I was happy to get this in exchange for an honest review.

"When the manufacturer sent me this in exchange for an honest review, my husband rolled his eyes...he is really particular about his vehicles (has them detailed professionally), but he agreed to give it a shot.

When it first arrived, you could see that he was super skeptical.  First he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  Then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).

He took it outside and vacuumed his freshly-washed car....and came back with a vacuum that had picked up a bunch of dirt in his squeaky-clean car.  haha.  (see pic) Now he's hooked!  He went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.

It works great, is easy to empty and clean, and everything fits in the bag. :)

Of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. I like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and I keep this in the trunk. The power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door CTS) without any problems. I have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.",5.0

"I'm so excited about these diffuser necklaces!  This set comes with two!  One in silver and one in bronze to match other jewelry you are wearing.  I love them both and they are beautiful!  They arrived in a beautiful little black box and were packaged very nicely.  They would make an excellent gift for this reason, and you won''t be disappointed with the presentation! They come with eight different color choices for the felt pad that you put inside of them.  I love that there are so many pads so that I can change the oil smell on each one.  The variety in colors is a nice touch too so you can coordinate with different outfits. The lockets open up easily and the hinge is well hidden in the locket so that you don't really see it when you look at the jewelry head on.  I'm excited to have these aromatherapy diffuser necklaces because diffusing is a great way to therapeutically experience oils for emotional benefits.  Sometime when you put oils on your skin, they soak in so fast that you don't get the aromatherapy benefits for very long.  When an oil is placed on the felt pad inside these necklaces (I just use a couple drops) it lasts for hours!

"Who doesn't need a little extra help when it comes to cleaning our vehicles?

Before getting this Hotor I was using a little broom and dustpan. Don't judge me. When I was offered this vacuum at a discount in exchange for an honest review I was eager to use it mainly because I NEEDED it, and I was curious as to how well it would do.

I was very impressed with it right out of the box. It is super easy to use. Just plug it into your cigarette lighter and you are ready to go. It has everything you need to be able to your carpeting in the car and even handle spills! Pretty cool, huh? I also was surprised to see the nice carrying case for it, making sure it is protected and easy recognizable when you need it.

"A perfect color and perfect scent for the day.  I was lucky enough to try this product at a reduced price for my honest review.  This necklace is a gem.  I have worn this necklace out with just about everything both daytime and nighttime.  The necklace is a beautiful design which allows for many compliments and notices.  The infusion is absolutely wonderful.  The different oils I used with each of the colors just sets the mood for a wonderful day.  Throughout the day, my co-workers and people whom I am in contact with often commented on how they could smell the oil I was using that day and how nice it smelled.  I love this necklace and it will be a part of my wardrobe for a while.  Thanks for a great product.",5.0
"You can just slip this on, no hassle with fastening and unfastening.  It has a 24chain that matches.  There are 8 different discs that come with it.  They are in different colors.  If you are into the color sets the mood, then match your essential oil with the color.  If you are more concerned with fashion then you will probably find a color within the eight different colors to compliment what you are wearing.
The diffuser necklace I have is antique brass in color.  The design is simple yet interesting.  It opens up just like a picture locket. The hinge is on one side and it snaps closed on the other. To change discs, open it up, hold your hand under it, flip it over and the disc falls out.  The discs are a perfect fit so it isn't a problem to change them and they show no other color except the color of the disc.  I only used one drop of the lavender essential oil I have and it lasted two days before the scent begin to fade.  The first time I wore it I used lavender and when I took it off at bedtime I hung it on the bed post at the head of the bed.  I could smell lavender all night. With the ceiling fan running it was just a light scent.  Wonderful!
Wash the discs out with warm soapy water.  With some oils you may need to do it a couple times.  Lavender and peppermint were the two I had to do a second wash and rinse.
Each time I have worn it I have gotten several compliments.  After a compliment it makes for a good conversation piece.  It is an asset to any wardrobe.  It will go with most anything.  If you wanted you could change the chain. I think most people who are into essential oils will really like this.  If you haven't used essential oils this would be a good way to start.  The price is reasonable, it works with the oils, it is a nice piece of jewelry.  It deserves a 5 star.  Hope you find this review helpful.

"I've been looking for a good deal on Aromatherapy Diffuser necklaces for a few weeks and was super excited to come across this option where I didn't have to choose between a silver or a bronze colored necklace - I could get BOTH!
Each necklace is very lovely, the bronze is just right and the silver one has got a beautiful shine to it!  The chains are rather long for the necklaces so that they hang low on the chest, so it is easy to tuck away if you want and use your body heat to help warm the oil within the necklace as well as lift it away from your body far enough to smell it yourself or allow someone else to smell it without getting too much into your personal space either.  I like the length of the necklace. I think if you want to wear it shorter, although the chain isn't designed for it, I think the hook clasp that it has might be able to clasp on the links in the chain to be able to shorten it.
The felt pads that came with the necklaces are great quality as well. They are the perfect size for the necklaces, no having to squeeze them into the necklace and they aren't too small either. You can also only barely see the color of the pad through the filigree so it doesn't look weird either. The felt pads are nice and thick too, so that it holds a good amount of oil to last you throughout the day as well. It's totally bonus that this vendor uses Amazon Prime to ship the items and you can get them quickly!

"This necklace seems to be better constructed than the other aromatherapy necklaces I have. The felts are nice and thick, and they absorb essential oils well so that they do not drip. I've had one brand before that had felt so thin that one drop soaked it, and any more made it drip. This necklace does not have that problem, which makes it safer to use since essential oils are so concentrated they can cause sensitivity if used on the skin without being diluted.

The necklace came in a nice box that would make it a lovely gift.

"This is a really lovely oil diffuser necklace with some wonderful features:

1. Enjoy the essential oil whenever you are without directly touching your skin. I have sensitive skin, and sometimes I find the oils can be irritating. I like to use peppermint oil when I have a headache, and I have frequent headaches. I prefer using a diffuser necklace to rubbing the oil on my temples or forehead. I've had problems with my eyes watering with the peppermint so close to them. The necklace is the perfect solution for me.

2. Creative sunflower design and fits with a variety of current fashion style. Not only is it a piece of jewelry, it is a function work of art. It's really lovely. I was surprised by how nice it looks in person.

3. The material used for the pendant necklace is 316L surgical grade stainless steel, it is the highest quality of stainless steel in the market. It would absolutely guarantee a lifetime! The stainless steel is much better than silver. It maintains its lustre, not dulling and tarnishing like silver does.

4. The pendant has magnetic closure and it closes very well,you can never worry about the oil pad dropping out once you close it. The pendant closes firmly and stays closed. Because of the magnetic closure, there are no clasps to bend, wear out or break.

5. The pads are washable so you can clean them and use another type of oil in them. The necklace comes with 8 different colored pads, so you can color code them for different oils, which is what I do.

This pendant comes in a lovely box and would make a very nice gift.

"This is a great set of diffuser necklaces.  When I looked at other diffuser necklaces, some were rather unattractive and unappealing.  I got this so that I could wear them when I needed them, whether I was at work or home or school or wherever.  I like the option to have both colors.  I like that there is a gold and silver and then quite a few of the replacement pads for the essential oils.  The clasp is easy to open and close.  I haven't had any issues with the locket opening or anything.  I like that this is a long necklace.  I don't usually wear short necklaces so I was a little worried about the chain length of this product but it turned out I was worried for nothing.  I like the design on the front of the locket.  It is very feminine and pretty.  I also like how the back of the locket is smooth.  Ive ran into issues before where the back of the locket isn't smooth and will snag on my clothing so I appreciate that this one is very smooth and doesnt snag my clothing.

"I bought this diffuser necklace for my wife, and she absolutely LOVES it. She wears it with different colored pads and oils every day, and she just recently asked me to purchase a few more so she can give them as gifts. So many people have commented on how nice it looks and smells... along with asking where they can get one for themselves. She tells me that she feels that it looks great, the oil chamber is easy to open and close... and stays closed unless you want it opened. It came with enough colors to use with a variety of oils and outfits. We have ordered an additional set of pads so we are good to go for a long time. The biggest surprise was how nice and heavy the actual necklace was.

I absolutely love this Aromatherapy necklace 2pk. It comes with 8 reusable pads which I thought was great since other similar options had disposable pads. I really didn't want to reorder the pads if I didn't have to. The necklace lays intentionally at chest length in order to continually release the essential oils from the warm of the chest. The pendant is nice size about 1.5 inches and is very stylish. Can easily go from jeans to dressy attire,very versatile. The only problem I had was which one I wanted to wear. Both the bronze and the silver are lovely. I have been using it with peppermint essential oil and it was so nice to smell it throughout the day for a quick pick me up.

"I have a different infuser necklace that my 2 sons keep trying to get me to let them use so I purchased this set for them. There are 2 necklaces in this set one bronze and one silver. It includes 8 felt pads so you can change colors and oils in the diffuser necklace. Both necklaces are stylish and good quality. They are like lockets and the piece that locks them holds well so no worries that the felt pad will just fall out. These necklaces are nicely weighted, not too heavy. The chain is nice it is just the right size for us both in length and in thickness.

My youngest son is 8 he wears his when he is at home and I hang it near his bed at night with some lavender to help him rest better or with an oil that helps with breathing when he has a stuffy nose. My oldest son is 15, he wears his to school with Vetiver oil and Lavender oil to help him focus and relax. He likes it much better than having the oil on his skin. He loves how he can always lightly smell it but can lift it up and smell it if he is feeling more stressed. (Even his classmates come ask to smell his necklace). He gets a lot of compliments on his necklace and people asking where he got it from. We are very happy with this purchase of this diffuser necklace set and would recommend it.

"This is a winner in my opinion. It looks very fine and intricate in design.

The clasp is sturdy and well made. The chain is 24 inches long and nice, but I would prefer the chain to be about 2 inches longer for a locket type necklace. That is only my personal preference.

The locket opens to the side and seems to be very tight fitting which I like. To me it means it won't be opening up when I don't want it to and I like that.

The necklace comes with 8 colored discs that can be used to hold drops of your favorite Essential Oil. It is nice to be able to pick a color that will coordinate with the clothing I am wearing. (On a good note, it will be easy to use a piece of regular felt to cut my own discs in the future as they become soiled. You don't have to by special ones that could be pricey.)

"This HOTOR Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace is wonderful. It has a better quality feel than expected. A lot of necklaces are light and cheap feeling where as this one has a little weight to it. The design is beautiful and I've received a lot of compliments on it. It comes with 8 round felt pads to drop aromatherapy on. I change out the felt pads to a color that matches my outfit for the day. I put about 6 to 8 drops of aromatherapy on it and it did't drip yet allowed enough scent. I have been traveling lately and driving through the country and wore this. I took it off for comfort and stored it on my rear view mirror. It hung there over night while I slept in a hotel. It was a delight to enter my car the next morning because the Stress Relief aromatherapy blend I had on the felt in the necklace. I think this is a wonder diffuser to use as a necklace or to keep your car smelling nice.

I recommend this product. It is a great way to enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy without placing essential oils directly on your skin.

"decent price, good quality",5.0
I am new to essential oils and I was interested in finding new ways to use them. One way that I found that I could use them was in an essential oil diffusing necklace. I love my diffusing necklace because it relaxes me and keeps me peaceful during the day. But the only thing that I do not like about my necklace is that I am not able to change scents out because my necklace only came with three pads. This is why I decided that I needed to get the HOTOR 11 Pics Diffuser Necklace Pads Round Pendant Necklace Refill Pads Reusable-0.886 Inch Diameter. I like the fact that they come in a variety of colors that way I can switch between different outfits plus I can change out scents quickly. So with this pack you get eleven pieces that you can switch out and you can rinse them out and change scents.  I love that you have so many colors and I love that they are thick pads and that they are very good quality ones. I bought these also specifically because this is the same brand that my diffuser necklace is so I knew that the quality would be great. They are extra thick and they do not leak unless you put too much oil on them. I find that they are perfect for my necklace. I have received a discount for my honest review. The opinions and statements are my own and are in no way biased because of said discount,5.0
"This is a beautiful necklace. It came in a nice gift box, and when I took out the necklace I was surprised how heavy and intricate it was. It is also on a nice chain. The pads for the aromatherapy are a perfect size to fit in the locket. The locket opened easily, but wasn't going to open accidentally.
I am new to aromatherapy, so I wasn't sure how much essential oil to use on the pad. The oil comes out in such a fine drop that I think I overdid it as the first time I tried it, I soon got a migraine headache. However, I am sure that is because I used too much oil.
The color of the pads shows through the cutouts of the locket nicely. They did not match very well with my wardrobe, but there also were black and white pads that would with anything. I see that there are plenty of places on Amazon where you can buy replacement pads.
In all, I think this is a beautiful necklace that I would wear even without the aromatherapy pad or with the pad to provide color but with no oil on it. For most of you, I know you are buying it for the aromatherapy quality, and I think it works perfectly as that as well.

"I got tons of compliments from day one!  Things like, ""You smell like the spa"" and ""I want one"".  A cashier complimented it before she even knew it was a diffuser and even had me write down the name so she could get one herself.  I don't love the chain length but a piece of ribbon or extender could fix that easily.  The colors look subtiler behind the pendant.  I put 7 drops (which was too much) but it lasted over 24 hours!!!!!  I love it and will probably get one in a silver tone.",5.0
"I received this product at a discount to give it my honest review and let me say it is AMAZING!!! I am an avid essential oil user and I am always looking for ways to diffuse essential oils and finding ways to use them in the best ways possible. This necklace is amazing. When I got it I put my tranquillity essential oil on one of the pads and I wore it all day.  I could smell the Tranquility throughout the day, it was calming, and beautiful! I received so many compliments on the necklace and I will be purchasing this for my customers as they are always looking for reccomendations for products like this. I love that it comes with a few different pads that you can interchange, so that you can use different essential oils or have different colors  as an accent. I absolutely love it and would purchase it at the full price. I cannot speak more highly of this product! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!",5.0

"This dual, double side comb is awesome! It is pretty nice, and has a simple design on it. This can be used for the bread but I will admit that I have been using it for hair and my fly aways. I do use oil in my hair, and bread and it helps comb it through. I have not ran into it causing damage it but do this at you own risk of course. I was able to get this product at a small discount in order to review and share my honest and open opinion. I really do like this. Since it is double sided you have the option of fine or course comb.

"I purchased the HOTOR Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace Essential Oils Locket Pendant With 8 Refilled and Washable Pads in Gift Box in Silver.  I absolutely love it!  It is a wonderful size-not huge, but not tiny either.  The chain is a good length and hits in a nice place on my chest.  I love that it comes with different color felts so I can make it match my outfit-or I can use different colors for different scents of essential oils.  I have recently begun using essential oils, mainly for anxiety and to help me sleep as well.  I have tried diffusing and made several roll ons to use, but I love the idea of a diffuser necklace for when I'm on the go!  Then I can have my essential oil with me where ever I go.  It only takes a few drops of oil to make the necklace effective at diffusing the oil.  It is easy to add oils when I need to freshen up the scent as well.  The locket opens easily, but also latches closed tightly.  The felt pads are nice and thick and can easily be washed when needed.  They should last a long time with how durable they are.

I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This in now way affects my review.  I would recommend this to anyone who uses essential oils.  It's a great necklace at a great price.",5.0

"I love this necklace. In all honesty, I wasn't expecting too much in the way of quality but was blown away when I'd opened the box. The product is situated just as you see in the picture, with a packet of scent-holding tabs in every color shown. The metal is solid and the hinges strong enough to hold together a soaked tab when shut. The size is larger than I expected, I expected a small little pendant when in reality it's about the size of a half dollar.

The vents in the front of this particular one allow whatever scent you choose to be readily smelled all day. I love to put some lavender into this pendant and where it out while doing errands. Frankly, the public is infuriating and when dealing with them while trying to get things done as soon as possible, aggravation is sure to occur. A little lavender is enough to ease the tension and any headaches that might occur.

I hadn't actually expected to receive this item yet, as it was due to be delivered this upcoming week. So shipping was astoundingly fast, especially for coming from China! I'm thoroughly impressed by this product and will probably order another in the bronze sometime soon!

"I received the Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace Antique Bronze Essential Oils Locket Pendant With 8 Refilled and Washable Pads in Gift Box. Firstly, I this did not disappoint. I've been dying to have one of these necklaces, and so happy to finally have one. Let's start with the necklace it self. The necklace is light weight and very comfortable. It hangs just right on my neck. It has a very flattering design that shows color (from the pds). I love the Antique Bronze color, it goes with pretty much everything.
It comes with 8 colors of Pad refills that are reusable. I love this, as I can match it with what I'm wearing for the day. They are very easy to wash, with soap and water.

I absolutely love this little cloud!!! I'm so absent minded & this keeps my keys quickly accessible right by my front door. All I have to do is pull lightly as I rush out in the morning!

No drilling required so that's a bonus.  Happy I made this purchase,5.0

"This product has good design features and accommodates several sized phones, tablets, pads, to be charged simultaneously. The front slots will hold the slimmer phones (without and thick protective cover) in the upright position. Note that in the picture you can see the upright position for the Samsung from Verizon has to be upside down for the charging cable to plug in to the phone. The phone that is in the horizontal position is on a protective case and is on the slot at the back. It is too thick to stand upright.
The two front slots can also accommodate a phone lying lengthwise, but the phone would need to be more to the left and out of the way of the ""watch stand"".
The watch stand has an embedded magnet and it connects to the base with that. I used the watch stand to thread the charging wires up to the phones. There is a nice hole in the top of it that works for this purpose.
There are several holes at the back of the stand for pens etc.
The footprint of this stand is small and tidy. For me, that means that the devices I have to charge will not be strewn all over the place; the wires will be where I need them for a charge and the phones and devices can be read while being charged. And all around good design.

I really like this diffuser.  Very pretty LED lights and puts out a nice mist.  I like that I can use it from 100ml to 500ml. It gives me options for how long I want to run it. I can smell my essential oils when diffusing.,5.0
"I received this Essential Oil Diffuser just a few days after I ordered them. It showed up in perfect condition and was very well packaged! I have been using aromatherapy and essential oils for a while now and decided it was time for a diffuser. What I like about this one is it has cool mist; its very quiet and has multiple run time options including a basic on / off for overnight use. There are also different colors for the nightlight option if needed and a no light setting as well. My husband snores a lot and the added moisture in the bedroom has helped reduce his snoring.
I did receive this for a discounted price for a fair and honest review... however, I try to work with items I need so I can give them a real trial, and thus my opinions and experiences are a real and true reflection of my experience with the product.

Another beautiful scent locket from HOTOR. I love the scent lockets made by this company. This is my second one and it's just as beautiful as the first one. This locket arrived much earlier than the estimated delivery date. It's made of some type of silver colored metal which I believe is steel. It's meant to keep a piece of material that is soaked in scented oil inside the locket and the scent is released or enhanced by the body heat. If you have scented fragrance oils this is a wonderful way to use them. The company includes three scent pads in pink white and black. These pads fit perfectly inside the locket. My only problem with the pads is that i can't reuse them. I will have to use cotton or fabric to soak up the oil once I use up the pads. I have many scent lockets made by Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab which I also wear but it's nice to switch off once in awhile. These lockets also remind me of jewelry made by Lois Hill. At one time that company made silver lockets that looked similar to these.,5.0

"I recently ordered an aromatherapy diffuser necklace that came with 5 pads for different scents.  I decided that I needed more pads for wearing different essential oils so I went ahead and ordered this kit.  I have to say that I am impressed with the pads.  They are about 3 times thicker than the ones that came with my necklace.  I've included a side by side comparison photo.  They fit perfectly in the necklace, despite the extra thickness as well.  I love that they are all different colors.  I tend to equate different essential oils with a color so keeping track of what oil I used on each pad will be a lot easier.  I also like that with all the colors available, I can color coordinate them with my clothes.  Disclosure! I was allowed to review this product at a  discount in return for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed in this review are my own and the rating given is a reflection based off of my personal interaction with the product.

This necklace is one of two that I own and I have to say it is my fave! It comes with three felt circles to apply oil to and they aren't cut too big like some are so the fit in the necklace nicely. The finish in the necklace is a brushed nickel look and it pairs nicely with lots of outfits.,5.0
"This mount has two of the best features I've seen, and I own four different car mounts for my phone.  Two stick to the dash, but my dashboard is at an angle and farther away than the air vents, so even though they work, I didn't much like them and had to scrape the taped portion of it off my dash.  I also tried one which clamped to the air vent, but the clamp had to by tightened by awkwardly turning a screw with your hand.  No matter how hard I tightened it, it would fall off within a couple of days, usually while I was trying to put my phone in it or rotate the phone.
This mount is a unique approach I've hadn't seen elsewhere, and I  didn't even know it until I got it.  The part that attaches to the vent looks like a clamp in the picture, unfortunately, but it's not.  It's a spring loaded device that completely encircles the air vent once it's attached making it impossible to fall off.  It also only takes a second to attach.  The other part I like about it are the arms that extend from the portion that holds the phone back to your dashboard keeping it from moving out of position.  It's more stable than the other air vent mount I tried.  The mount also has rubber lined grips with arms at the bottom of the base, both of which keep the phone from sliding out of place.  I can't think of any way they could improve it.  Highly recommend!",5.0
"I have been looking for an energy-saving aromatherapy lamp. This lamp can function (without oils and light) as a decent humidifier for a smaller room. When I added essential oils, it dispersed them nicely.

That said, the user manual is one of the most confusing and complicated I have encountered -- especially for a fairly simply item. The instructions seem to indicate that you may need to clean this every 24 hours and then let another 24 hours pass to dry out. And there are many thingd that may void any warranty offered.

I really like that you can use this as a small humidifier without any oil. And my experience has been that using essential oils in the amount recommended will do well with a small room -- but not a big room.

I was looking for an efficient (LED) aromatherapy diffuser that could fill the (smaller) spaces I have. It does.

"Im really pleased with these little felt discs. Theyve been packaged in a nice, resealable plastic pouch, where Ill be able to store them easily for future use. There are 11 of them, each one a different color. The pink disc is a little more vibrant than the one that came with my necklace, and I like it the better for it.

The main difference Im happy about, however, is the fact that these discs are just a little bit bigger than the original ones. With those, I found that the discs were a little too small for the recess in the pendant. It was a small thing, but it was still annoying. It wasn't very noticeable when the pendant was closed, but it was a little, if one were to look closely. These still don't fit perfectly, and are a little on the small side, but they're definitely an improvement over the ones that came with the pendant.

They hold the smell applied to them for ages, which is the same as the original pads. They work really well to carry about the smell of essential oils, as well as perfume, which is another use I put these to.

Im happy to have more than the three different colors, and all of them so vibrant! They show up well through the slots of the diffuser pendant, and make it easier to match what Im wearing. They have a smoother edge than the original discs as well. I don't know if that is better or not, just different. The original ones looked as if the round edge was melted during the cutting process, while these do not have that same look or feel. Maybe that is why they are a little bigger? Whatever the case, I love them!

I love this thing! I had a small space to hang a key holder so that I will (hopefully) stop misplacing my keys.

Even if you don't have an apple product but you have even just tablet and phone this would still work great! and there are nice size holes in the back to stick stylets for your electronics.

I like to watch Netflix on my phone while I am cooking dinner or doing other tasks while I am sitting in one place. I usually am leaning my phone up against something. It slides down and falls onto the counter and over and over and I keep setting it back up so I can see the display. I get food or water or whatever all over my phone in the process. This device holds my phone at the perfect angle for me to be able to watch whatever I want without worrying about my phone falling.

"Very cute necklace. And I love aromatherapy so this is perfect. Mine did come without pads for some reason, but it's ok I just made some. I also added a different chain as this one just felt cheap.

"I recently bought the brand new Apple Watch Sport Model. Having bought the I new watch, I needed to buy some accessories for it. One of the first items I needed to purchase was a stand for the watch. Not just a stand, but one that was made with quality and that was easy to set up and one that could hold my iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Air 2. Also, I travel across the world frequently, so I needed something that I could easily pack, that was portable, but also very sturdy.

In my search for a stand I found the HOTOR Apple Watch Stand that was carved from bamboo. This stand is awesome! The stand is built with strong and sturdy construction because HOTOR built it with bamboo . This bamboo wood stand is solidly built and because of the way it's crafted, it's has a better stabilization. Plus it's natural look is very classy and chic for wherever you choose to place it. It's designed to perfectly to hold and support the Apple Watch at a perfect 45 degree angle as the watch charges (along with your smart phone and tablet). This stand is also designed that once your Apple Watch, smart phone and tablet on it, your items won't slip or fall off.

This stand fits perfectly on my desk at my office and on the night stand beside my bed at night. The bottom line is that the  stand is designed to work and fit anywhere. Plus I always receive numerous comments from my co-workers about how nice looking it is as well.",5.0

"I really like this oil diffuser. I bought it for in my son's room to diffuse lavender oil at night. My son really enjoys having this in his room and it actually cuts out the need for his night light due to the soft glow it gives off. I was hesitant to purchase due to prior reviews stating a small mist stream, but I have come to find out that it works perfectly for my son's room. The small stream deters my son from wanting to put his hand above the steam stream, because it is not as noticeable. I was also worried about the small stream not properly diffusing the oil thorough the room but my son's room is 10ft by 9ft, and this diffuser distributes the oil throughout the room. I really enjoy the timer on this item, as I can set it for two hours and it is on prior to and just as he falls asleep. My son has complimented this diffuser a couple times, and it has been a great hit with him. Disclaimer: This item was received at a discounted price for an honest review.",5.0
"This HOTOR wood stand is everything it needs to be and more.  The picture doesn't even show that the stand has three cutouts for my apple pen or any stylus.  As described the stand will hold your Apple Watch using a removable stand being held by a magnet.  There is a cutout that holds the cord in place while the watch is connected to the charger.  There are two spaces for your phone which is very convenient  for someone like me who has a work phone and personal phone.  You can display the phone either horizontal or vertically and your phone is more then secure.
  Now to the iPad holder cutout.  This for sure as advertised will hold your iPad mini and iPad Air.  I am a little hesitant to put the IPad pro in this as it may not be long enough for Horizontal display and sturdy enough for vertical display.  I do wish this part was a little bit larger to take away any doubt or apprehension but at any rate this stand is of high quality and is very useful on a nightstand or on a desk.  I like to be able to organize my devices while charging them so that they aren't taking up so much unneeded space.

I usually have my phone on my lap when using the GPS and we all know that is not the best idea, as looking down can cause an accident. If you happen to be someone who usually keeps your phone in your lap while trying to use the GPS then you NEED this product! Not only for the hands free aspect but for the safety of not looking down while driving! I mean let's be honest, how many times has your phone slid off your lap and onto the floor at your feet? This product stops that issue too! It fits my Galaxy S6 perfect and holds well on the windshield. I did have some problems with the vent clip however and it did get a little smooshed while trying to get it to clip. That may have just been a user error. I will try it again, but I really prefer to keep it on the windshield anyway. That is just personal preference. I don't know why I waited this long to make this purchase.

"I ordered this necklace for my daughter. She sometimes suffers from anxiety and we have found that aromatherapy/essential oils can help her. She carries a roller bottle in her backpack for school that she can usr to apply the essential oils as needed, but I wanted some way for her to utilize the aromatherapy to help her, especially during times she may not be able to access her backpack (like during testing, for example) My sister who sells essential oils recommended I look for a necklace diffuser. I wanted to find something that was pretty and didn't look like anything other than just a piece of jewelry.

First I must tell you that this piece is beautiful, the picture does not give it justice. It coms in a vary nice gift box, so if you are giving this as a gift that is something to consider. The different color pads give you options, being able to switch them out to match your outfit or using a color for different scents. My daughter loves the black because it really makes the silver design ""pop"". The length of the chain is on the longer side, which I was not sure my daughter would like, but she has learned that it is long enough to pull up closer to her nose is she feels like she needs the effects of the aromatherapy more, or as she called it ""if I need to take a hit""....teenagers. The ring on the diffuser is big enough you should be able to switch chains pretty easily if you wanted to. My daughter is considering putting hers on a silk rope because she like that look more and then she could just tie it at her desired length.

Chances are if you are searching for something like this you are at least somewhat familiar with the benefits of aromatherapy. This is a beautiful inconspicous way to achieve the results you are looking for. I wish I would have thought of something like this back when I used to work in a hospital, having something nice smelling close to my face would have probably been useful from time to time :) I am considering getting one for myself and my other daughter, we both suffer from  migraine headaches so these might help us also.

Although I received this product for reduced/free in exchange for my honest opinion, it is my honest opinion/review of this product. I am also a regular Amazon shopper and I rely on review for my decisions so I always strive to reviews that are as honest based my my experience.

"This diffuser necklace is perfect for wearing your favorite scents! I LOVE wearing spearmint, lime and stress away essential oils. IT's my ""happy"" scent! The diffuser part is pretty big, about the size of a 50 cent piece. But it is really light. It's not heavy at all like I thought it might be.
The picture shows 3 felt pieces that come with the necklace. I got a total of 5! The 3 pictured are thicker, heavier felt. The two additional ones that I got are thinner - standard thickness I would say. The colors pictured are accurate - black, white and a pretty light pink. The additional ones are purple and tan. I like having the extra options and colors. The locket it a pretty, shiny silver and can be work with just about anything.
I only tested this using therapeutic grade essential oils, I did not try actual perfumes or body sprays - I don't own any. Being that I am used to essential oils, I added about 3 drops, depending on the blend that I was using. The scent lasted all day! I would get a whiff throughout the day just by my normal body movements. If it was a particularly stressful day and I was wearing Stress Away I would hold it up to my nose as needed and take some deep breaths to help melt away the stressful feeling.
The chain is a little too long for my liking. The diffuser part sits right at breast level. Some like them long, I prefer a little shorter.
Make sure to take out the felt pads when you're not using, it will help to keep the necklace from tarnishing. I just clean the necklace with a drop of lemon essential oil if needed.
Overall I really enjoy this necklace, I plan on getting one for my daughter to wear to school to help her stay focused and I think this will work just fine.

This product is just as stated. It is perfect for a bedside diffuser. The only thing I would caution is it does not have a plug to connect from the USB cord they send to stick into the wall. On the positive side of that though is I can use it in my car!!! I have been looking for something like this for my car for quite some time! I have a USB connector in my car and this works great for that. If you do not have a USB connector in your car you can buy an adaptor and it will fit into the 12V charger. This is a perfect mini diffuser and I highly recommend getting it. I was able to get a discount when I purchaced mine in return for a review. I am so glad I got it and will be buying another one even without a discount. Great product.,5.0
So aweome! I love the color options the built in led light provides. Only needs a few drops of oil and water and its super easy to operate.,5.0
"I recently purchased my daughter an aromatherapy diffuser pendant necklace from this same company which she's really excited about, but it only comes with 3 pads - white, black, and pink. I was so happy to find these since it will give her so many other color choices to dress it up a little!  The colors shown in the description are very accurate - there is white, black, purple, royal blue, aqua blue, magenta (a little darker than hot pink), burgundy, light pink, lime green, orange, and yellow. I like that they are also made by Hotor so we knew they would be compatible with her pendant. These are made of a thick, sturdy, felt-like material. Not only are the pads reusable, they can also be washed up to 5 times, so she should get plenty of use out of them. I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I don't leave a positive review for a product unless I think it truly deserves it.",5.0

"Love this under umbrella light. It is easy to add onto the pole and has four surprisingly bright lights that light up the table below.
I like that it works on 3 AA batteries as I always have these types of batteries around. I also see what looks like a place to attach an electrical cord which would be a great addition should I want to run it on electricity (it seems the cord is not included).
The fact that the lights are so well spaced, means that all sides of the table get well lit.
I would definitely recommend this light.

"You get exactly what you see and that's a very good thing. Beautifully designed. I purchased this for my manager as she is always looking for her phone on her desk and this desk stand has solved the perpetual problem of loosing her phone. Perfect gift idea.

"This bamboo stand is exactly what I was looking for!  I have an iPhone 6 and it fits perfectly on this stand, exactly as shown in the picture.  I read books on my phone, and this stand lets me multitask by eating breakfast and being able to read at the same time.  I do sometimes put the stand and phone on a box or something to elevate it, but it may not be necessary for everyone.  This stand is also a good place to just place your phone when you're not using it, and it doesn't get lost or covered with papers on the table.  The stand comes with little feet to stick on the bottom - I used it for a few days without the feet and never had a problem with it sliding.  I added the feet and now it stays put no matter what.  I recommend this stand.

"I received this little guy today, and I love it. It is light-colored bamboo, just as pictured; the edges are very smooth. I am always laying my phone down and then covering it up with mail, etc.  I can set my iPhone 5 on it vertically, or horizontally.  The only way it can be charged while on this stand is to do it in horizontal/landscape mode, but that is not a problem to me.

"As photographer I'm always looking for different ways to use lights and shadows on my subject.  When I first saw this Rechargeable Camping Light I thought it looked like a smaller version of the ever so popular ICE light photographers rave about but the cost is hefty (nearly $500).  Upon getting this in the mail I was surprised at the packaging being in a tube with everything I needed to keep it charged and work it.  I love the multiple settings it has and how well it fits in your hand.  Each setting is noticeably a different brightness.  I'm excited to put this to use in my photography business as well as during our summer camping trips.

I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5.0
I gave this to my daughter for her infants room. It puts out a good amount of humidity without overdoing it. Its small enough to go on the nightstand without being intrusive. I gave her lavendar oil with it and just a couple drops soothes the fussy baby. She loves the night light on it to nurse the baby by so he will go right back to sleep. Wonderful product.,5.0
"I really like the design of this diffuser. It's sleeker than most, which I find really attractive. Functionally this diffuser works really well. It puts a good amount of mist out but doesn't get anything wet. I also love how it has time settings for automatic shut off.",5.0
"As advertised, this product shows bright colors or you can that function off. Really diffuses the oil well and the scent really carries throughout the room. Very user friendly when reading the enclosed instructions. A+ product!",5.0
"I'm quite impressed with this handy light. It's almost like a glow stick, holds nicely in your hand and seems like it's well made for everything it offers. I have many reasons to like this light... the first one being that it is rechargeable. So many times you go through so many batteries on with flashlights. This charges the same as a cell phone,  it actually is that same as my phone I currently have. The charging cord had a USB end to connect to a computer, adapter or you could charge in a vehicle using the cell phone charging adapter. I have a mega power pack we use for charging devices when camping that would also work well to charge this in emergency situations.
  Another reason I really like this light is because it is LED ,the light is very bright with 4 different modes of brightness and a mode where the light flashes.  With the bulb being LED you get longer battery life on a charge. It comes with 2 carrying /wrist cords that can be attached at either end or both. I find this would work excellent to hang this light inside of a tent etc. ..The size of this is also nice it will pack in just about anywhere.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it next camping season.",5.0
Love this diffuser! Already used it multiple times and I just got it yesterday. It seems like a good quality and it's a great size for a small room. I am very pleased with it!,5.0
It's nicely made. Retuned because I didn't really need it and you can't really charge it while it's in this dock.,5.0
"Light has several settings. Each one increasing in brightness. The last setting flashes...which would be good in an emergency or an impromptu dance party! Haha! You just click the button on the device until you get to the desired light setting. With the final click, the device turns off again. It's about 1 foot long and a little bigger than a quarter in diameter. Easy to charge and convenient to carry with the included wrist straps.

what a great product. I don't know why anybody else has thought of it. its great for hanging keys up...the magnet is strong enough to hold 2 sets of keys with many keys on it.,5.0
"This is a great light.  It has low, medium, high, and shrobe.  Very bright on high but when you only need low light it is great.  You are able to use on low in a tent for example to find what you are looking for without waking the person next to you.  Can't sleep, use this light on low to read by and not wake the person next to you.  There are a million ways this light can be useful.  I look forward to exploring all I am of coming up with.  Recharges with my car charger for my phone too.  Great convenience.  This would be good for kids camping out.  Rechargable battery has long life for hours of seeing in the dark. I received a discount in exchange for writing a review.",5.0
"This is a very nice tabletop/umbrella light. Used it during a power outage and it easily lit up a 12x12 room for several hours. This unit is very light (less than a pound), so it won't help weight down your umbrella, but it fit mine with no issues. The light weight would make it an excellent light to take camping if you needed to carry your things with you.

"This cloud-shaped key holder is delightful - a very whimsical style that can hold even my husband's super-heavy key ring. It'll hold up anything magnetic, even my dog leashes, with very strong magnets. It has a cloud-shaped sticky backing that was a breeze to install. I received this product at a discount for my honest review and have been using it for several weeks now - I absolutely love it.

There are two spots to hang keys due to the magnets that are used. Every part of this is high-quality, from the backing, to the ultra-powerful magnets, to the perfectly smooth plastic cloud shape.",5.0

"I needed a small, effective, and attractive portable aromatherapy diffuser to bring with me to massage appointments. This one more than fits the bill!

The diffuser has a very low hum and pleasant bubbling sound but if music were playing during a session I doubt you would be able to hear it. The light cycles through the different colors or you have the option of clicking the button again to pause the light on a specific color. I love the light wood colored base paired with the colors. I went with the recommended 4 drops per 100 mL of water the first time I used it and that worked to fill a small room with a pleasant level of scent.",5.0

"This is a great little essential oil diffuser for the money.  If you are holding back purchasing a diffuser because they can be costly I'd recommend this one. It works great. We put it in my daughters room. It helps her sleep with relaxing lavender when she is stressed and helps with sinus congestion when we add peppermint, and also adds a fine mist of moisture to the air.",5.0
"Works perfectly as advertised. Looks great with apple products. The metallic finish complements MacBooks and iPads very well. The charger fits perfectly. The aluminum watch stand is admittedly lightweight, but I have had no problems using my 42mm stainless steel watch with the lightweight sports band and the heavier leather loop with magnetic closure. The non stick material underneath it makes it stick perfectly to my mirrored glass night table. It takes almost no room on my night stand and its size makes it portable enough to travel with if you wanted to. I love it and now will have to get one for my daughter too!! Highly recommended, especially at this low price point. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5.0
This oil diffuser is awesome. We love it!!  I like the way that it changes colors and that you also have the option to keep it on 1 solid color or you can choose not to have any color at all. It is very soothing and relaxing and I also like that it has a 4 hour shut off built into it so your water never dries up and you kills your machine.  I have seen these kind of machines before and wanted one but they were always so expensive and this one is great and easy to use for the money.,5.0

"After owning a small oil diffuser, I was in the market to get a bigger size diffuser for my large living room and going through less hassles re-pouring water every 3 hours. Once this product arrived, it was so easy to set it up and get started with my oils. My baby loved all the colors that changed in this diffuser and could watch this product for hours. On the other hand, my husband and I noticed right away that the smell from the essential oil I used was strong enough to pass it throughout entire room and within minutes we could smell lotus essential oil all over downstairs. It's not too strong but strong enough to create a fantastic smell all over the house. I highly recommend this product. It has several different features from how long you want this diffuser running 60, 120, 180 minutes and lights on or off. It was so simple to set up, you really don't need to read instructions. The only thing, I'd like to give a heads up. When the package arrives and you take the diffiser out, be aware the wall plug in is inside the diffuser. Simply open the top of the diffuser and everything you need will be inside.

"This diffuser is simple basic and compact just the height of my hand. It holds up to 100mls of water and no more then 3 drops of essential oils and runs continuously for up to 180 mins (3hrs) and has dim and bright white light options. One important thing to realize is that it plugs into a usb port, it does not have an electrical outlet plug in the kit. This makes it ideal for an office diffuser, but I honestly set it up in my living room using the base of an old cell phone charger after trying it several other places because I wanted something inconspicuous in the space and this just disappears against my white shelves. It works well, I have only used distilled water, so even though I cleaned it after three days, I saw no discernable buildup or lessening of steam or aroma. Note you need ascorbic acid for cleaning it, but I happen to keep.it in cabinet and it o took a few easy minutes to clean it.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount so that I could try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion about it with you.",5.0
"I purchased two different ultrasonic diffusers and of the two, this one is more attractive. I waited to review it until I had had chances to use it for several days and clean it once. It does require you to have ascorbic acid to clean it, but I actually did, and cleaning was easy. I have been using exclusively distilled water and there was no evidence of mineral build-up, but I can see how cleaning any oil residue would be important,so I intend to clean after every three days of use.  This diffuser runs continuously for the time you set it for, for up to 180 mins (3hrs) it can be left unlit or lit brightly or dimly, and I liked the bright setting for reading prebed stories. It takes no more then 3drops of essential oils and 100 mls of water, so if you want a blend it's best to premix it before adding it to the diffuser. The amount of steam is significant and can permeate the open front end of my house within 15 mins.

Personally, I don't need a diffuser with lots of colors and am fine with the continuous steam, if you want one that provides short bursts of steam, this is not for you, but for an attractive, simple option, this is a winner.

Everyone notices this on my desk! I am even considering ordering this as gift for some of my clients and friends!!! love it. simple and sleek!,5.0
"I love how compact and easy to move rooms this diffuser is! I have a larger one, that I sent way too much on (a mlm diffuser), thinking I would move it room to room. Nope, It's too much of a pain to get it set up in each room. This one is not small, but lightweight and petite enough where I easily take it back in forth from my office to my bedroom. It easily works filling up the whole room with the diffused oil. I know some diffusers have negative reviews for not working on enough square footage, this one is mighty. I love that it is USB charged. I plug it into my laptop and just face the oil to blow away from my computer. I also use it on my bedside table. I have an iHome docking station for my phone, which has a usb port where this plugs into. I love having all my essentials right at arms reach! If I get an upset tummy, I immediately diffuse without getting out of bed! Be sure to read the directions on how to remove old water. Then your diffuser will last forever!

I need this book to work on my parents sitting 95 chevy mark III van in the backyard.  It won't teach you how to blueprint the engine block but as far as maintenance (which is the only thing this old van really needs) it has mostly everything covered.,5.0
"So, I bought a 1988 Chevy Van thinking I would make a road trip from San Francisco to Portland in it. Alas, my $800 road trip van had some problems. Brake warning light on all the time, oil pressure gauge that jumped all over when I drove it. Anyway, I decided I would ""fix"" that van myself, so I bought this book. Being prone to long nights drinking and carousing in San Francisco and a procrastinator by nature, the van repair got put off for a bit. One sober day I decided to man up and start fixing the van. But where was the manual?

Hum! I looked high and low, and checked on Amazon to make sure I had actually bought it, which I had,  but I could not fine it anywhere. So I ask my girlfriend ""Hey, have you seem my Chilton manual for that van I bought?"" Her response was to point at a old bookcase in the corner of the hallway. ""Its there with my bibles and wedding planning books"" she said.

Hum, sounds like I am being set up. The problem is that this particular bookcase is right next to our super sized, four cat litter box. Being ignorant about littler box things, I stomped right over and, seeing my Chilton manual's spine, pulled it from the bookcase.

Well, as you probably guessed, the manual was not in it's original condition. It was somewhat damp, well actually, soaked with cat urine. It fell apart in my now urine soaked hands. If this was a movie, we would cut to a scene showing my girlfriend is cackling in the living room.

I guess what I am trying to say is that I have no idea if this manual is useful for GM Vans produced from 1987-1997. I sold the van soon afterwards and never gave it another thought. But my experience with other Chilton repair manuals had been very positive, so I guess this one would be good as well.",5.0

As others have said, there is a nut that slowly comes loose inside the head, eventually causing the gun to fail.

I used it on a few rivets, which it had a hard time gripping for some reason, and then I heard a snap. I took it apart and the rod between the handle and the head snapped. The metal was too thin. It's built too cheaply. Even the red grips are just a cheap plastic coating. I ended up going to ACE hardware to get the one they sell. I opened it up to see what that rod looks like and they use much thicker metal. Also, the grips they use are a soft rubber that makes using it more comfortable.",1.0
"Like most others who reviewed this tool, I thought I was buying an upgrade when my thirty year old no name riveter failed.  Was I fooled.  I've never in my life had a tool (or anything else, for that matter) fail so quickly.  I wasn't counting, but it probably worked for fewer than two dozen rivets when it started slipping and would no longer pop the rivet's mandrel.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely NOT RECOMMENDED.  I'd give it zero stars.",1.0
"Like everyone else said: it stopped working after a short time.  I haven't used one before so I thought all the slipping and not gripping might be normal, then it stopped working almost completely.  I ended up renting one the next day (another brand) and got more done in a few minutes then I did in many hours with this sub-functional product.  Under no circumstances would I allow a friend to purchase this product.",1.0
"Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting.",1.0
"I've used it several times but now that I'm in the middle of an important project, it completely fails.  I've taken it apart to try and fix it but no go.  If you're considering this product, I'd look elsewhere.  While researching the problem I found a customer service #.  Called it many times and just get a voice saying all lines are busy.  Very frustrating.",1.0
"My first Arrow RHT 300 failed after 12 rivets.  I did, as others, dissaseemble and clear it.  Still didn't work.  I returned it and the new one does nothing.  I'm using Arrow rivets spec'd for this gune with Arrow washers.  Completely confused how this piece of junk made it from a bench in the States to the factory in China.  I've used Arrow staplers for years with great satisfaction.  This product absolutely stinks.",1.0
"Have this unit and had multiple odd angle rivets.  Tool lasted less than 20 rivets.  Wont work now.  Thought this would be a great tool, the turning head is a great idea, but just not the quality.",1.0
"It stopped pulling after 20 rivets or so.  When it was woking it was difficult to use.  Hard to use only one had, which is how is designed to be used.

Works perfectly after about 500 rivets.",1.0
The head split and broke within the first 5 rivets I used it for. Wouldn't recommend this one. Try another brand or a higher quality.,1.0
Same problems as the others here. The head gets jammed up and you have to take it apart to clear it. After jamming a few times it stops gripping the head. Look elsewhere.,1.0
"I had used this model in the past and liked the convenience of the swivel head, so when it was time to pick up a rivet gun of my own for some projects I chose the same one.
Unfortunately I experienced the same problems as other reviewers. The very first time I tried to use it, it jammed up and wouldn't release the rivet. Twice I disassembled it to get it free and try again, to no avail.
I replaced it with a different brand and threw this one in the trash. The swivel head is a great idea if you get one that works, but based on all the poor reviews I think you'd be taking a risk buying this.",1.0
"This Arrow pop rivet gun seemed like a good choice to replace my cheap no name  gun that lasted for years and popped many rivets.  Good steel construction, swivel head, looked and felt like a heavy duty tool. WRONG!!! After 4 rivets it would pull no more.  I would have been better off just flushing $20 down the toilet!",1.0

I have to say that I am VERY disappointed with this purchase. If I had wanted an APC compatible battery I would not have bought what I was led to believe was a genuine APC battery. Since I can't return the battery for a refund, I will try it and if it works then I'll just use it and move on.

Word to the wise: If you want a genuine APC battery, go to[...] and buy from them! I've learned my lesson.",1.0
This is a ExcessUPS battery. It is clearly not am APC battery. Ir does not have the APC label and does not have the capacity that the APC battery in this class has. Amazon should drop this supplier for sending a different product. Very disappointed with Amazon and from other reviews it is clear Amazon cannot be trusted for suppling batteries.,1.0
Don't buy replacement batteries from Amazon.  They sent me the wrong battery but will not allow me to return it.  So I am out $61 and have to throw out the battery.  Go to Batteries Plus or some other local store to make sure you get the correct one.,1.0
"Received the battery OK and had an APC sticker on it with correct replacement number. It would not fit into the unit regardless of wedging and trying to ""shoehorn"" it into place. In fact I wedged so hard the plastic housing began to make cracking sounds and I quit. To get it to fit I would have to break or chisel out a section of the unit.
After I complained to Amazon they did give me credit and later I bought a complete unit with battery cheaper than the replacement battery alone. Go figure !",1.0
"I used Amazon's search engine to find which battery to use for an ES BE500 APC UPS. This is the one that they specified.

"Very, very, very disappointed!!!

 I looked up and searched for an APC RBC4 battery, and when I found the item and looked at the product image and it showed a battery with APC logo, and I ordered what I thought was an APC battery, opting for the more expensive APC $45 battery over a clone $25 battery believing I was getting a real APC product.

I am not sure how I am to handle this. The item being reviewed even states ""APC Replacement Batter Cartridge RBC4"", which is exactly what I wanted, not  a ""unknown brand"" look alike!

Not what I expected from AMAZON or Amazon retailers!",1.0
"I purchased this ""name brand"" battery rather than a generic equivalent because I was led to beleive that return postage was prepaid to recycle the old battery. When I received my battery, there was no prepaid sticker for the shipping box, but rather there was mention of a website for further instructions. The website had a message indicating that they no longer handle these types of batteries, but to return the battery to a local recycling center for automotive batteries. Before I spend another 5 bucks in gas to drive this battery somewhere, I think this bad boy will be hitting the trash can. I own several more APC UPS's, but the next time I need a battery replacement, I'll go with a much cheaper alternative than APC. (bait and switch??)",1.0
"This is the third strike for APC in my book.  Their equipment has now failed me three times.  Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended, then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed.  With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working.  Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.

I've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS.  This product (the battery) works fine for me, but I'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they aren't sure that the unit will work with new batteries.  I'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand.",1.0

"I ordered this battery believing it would be cheaper than buying a whole new UPS. If it had worked correctly it would have been but it is DOA out of the box.

"Upon inspection of this battery out of the box, it was obvious that it is a reconditioned battery.  There are many scuff marks on the sides and especially the bottom.  The plastic feet on the bottom are worn.  There is no date of manufacture.

If Amazon sells a product, I assume that it is new unless stated otherwise.  Considering the cost of returning this item, I am stuck with a less-than-acceptable product.  If you decide to buy this item from Amazon, you should inspect it carefully when you first receive it.  And let Amazon know that you are not happy if you receive a product that does not meet their standards.",1.0
"I ordered this specifically because it was shown as an APC product.

"I recently purchased 2 RBC2 batteries for 2 APC UPS that finally went bad. One appears to work fine, so no complaints about that. The other went bad within 2 weeks... (WOW!!! if there is not a bad omen for the number '2'!!).

When they both came out of the box, they appeared to be either old (ie., sitting around for a while), or a refurbished item. OH BY THE WAY!!! something you will need to know. The batteries are non-returnable item, so if you are sent a bad battery, you're stuck with it.

I don't know why these pads fall apart so fast but I only used each one less than 15 minutes and they broke up and pieces of foam flew all over the room.  I think I should get my money back???????  I usually don't write negative reviews but there is really something wrong with the quality of this foam pad.,1.0

Update, 4 months later. No problems with the creeper. I am using it to go under my semi truck and trailer The only issue is that ""The Rough Rider""is little bit to high (with me on it) to pass under the brake chambers of the truck and trailer. It is a good product but should be like 4-5 inch lower to be used under semi truck. I purchased exactly this model, because the manufacturer stated that the Rough Ryder is widely used with low enforcement DOT. This is a false advertisement right here. I don't see any DOT inspector using this, if he can not go under the brake chambers, They probably using modified version or something else.

Contacted the company to complain about the head and neck rest. Talked to the owner. Absolutely disgusting how he will not stand behind his product to fix the problem. Problem is the head and neck rest is molded in a 3 dimensonal logo out of some very hard product. Feels like a bunch of rocks under your head or neck.

"(This review is for the battery powered model)  In 2001 I bought two Park-Zone PZ-1100 battery powered devices, one for each of my cars.  To this day they work flawlessly.  The batteries last about a year.  In 2008 I bought a new PZ-1100 for my mother, but it didn't work correctly it had all the symptoms described by other reviewers - green light never comes on, yellow and red only occasionally.  So I tried another new one, exact same symptoms.  Then I noticed a visible difference between the new units and my older units.  The current PZ-1100 has two 1/2 inch ultrasonic speakers, whereas my older PZ-1100 had a single one inch speaker.  I also noticed a slight change in the company name; the original single speaker models were made by Measurement Specialties in Fairfield, NJ.  The newer dual-speaker models are made by Measurement LTD, Inc. in Parsippany, NJ.  I suspect there has been an ownership change.  I decided to try and find an older Park-Zone like my original units.  I found several people selling the older version of PZ-1100 which has the single speaker.  You can tell whether it's the old or new by the photo on the box.  Even though the boxes look identical, if you look closely at the picture on the box you can see if the transmitter has one or two speakers.  I recently purchased a single-speaker PZ-1100 and it works great just like my original units. I bought another one from a different seller and it also works great.  I'll give one to my mother and keep the other as a spare.  In case anyone is tempted by the AC powered models, check out their user instructions and you'll discover that if the power fails it will not automatically switch to battery power, so you will lose your settings.  I briefly lose AC power several times a year so for me the battery powered model is actually more reliable.  And no you won't crash into your wall if the batteries go dead, because either you'll see a flashing red light as you enter the garage, or it will be completely dead.  Either way when you don't get that reassuring green light as you enter your garage you'll know you have to park it the old fashioned way this time.  Since that only happens about once a year it's not a big deal. ***Updated 2-21-09*** Another reviewer (Theseus on February 7, 2009) made an excellent point that Park Zone isn't designed to get you within inches of your wall, since the mimimum range is 1.3 feet.  As long as that's not your situation, I find that Park Zone very accurately places my cars in the exact spot every time, giving me the exact clearance that I want at both the front and rear of my cars.  Before Park Zone I was always worried that I hadn't pulled my car far enough into the garage, but with Park Zone I don't even look when I close the automatic garage door, after several years of use it has never put me in the wrong spot.",1.0
"I recieved as a gift and thought it was great, for a while. The green light is so dim you cannot see it. I called and was told that was normal and it is caused by the green lens being too thick. This is wrong, the green LED is too dim. If I wasn't happy they suggested I return it.",1.0
"We purchased two parkzones. One we sent it back already and the other one sits on the wall with dead batteries.

You can't use 2 in the same garage as they interfere with each other. Batteries don't last longer than 1 month and yellow to red indications are inconsistent. Sometimes the red indicator doesn't come on until you are inches from the wall, other times the back end of the car is still blocking the garage door from closing. At times the unit doesn't come on at all????

I don't recommend this unit unless you want to risk crunching the garage door onto your car or drive into the wall of your garage.",1.0
"Well, I had wanted this for a long time.  Just got one for Christmas and couldn't wait to get it installed.  We followed all the instructions, even measured.  But if I didn't have the sense to stop short of the wall, I would have hit it because the light never turned on.  If it did turn on, it would turn on way too late.  Poor produdct, :(",1.0
"I had to replace my old park zone and bought this one.  I didn't realize that this was not exactly the same as the older version.  It looked the same but it did not work the same.  When I installed it on the wall, I was able to calibrate it with no problems.  The lights blinked as it should and thought I was ready to go.  When I came home from work, the lights did not light up at all as I tried to park the car.  I recalibrated and tried again but the lights would not come on.  I decided to return the item.  It was not the same as the older version.  Unfortunately the old version is no longer available.",1.0
"I still have my original PZ-1100 which has worked fine. However...when I needed a second one...I bought the PZ-1500. The first thing I noticed was that it had 2 sensors. This proved to be very difficult to position as it has a WIDE area the it senses...as opposed to the one sensor unit.

Recently it stopped working and I discovered the power supply was bad. Thinking that it merely had failed I reverted to using batteries. There is something wrong in the unit (which undoubtably blew the power supply) because it 'eats' a new set of batteries in 3 days!!! It is out of warrantee and I will not send it back for repairs.

I thought that I might get another PZ-1100...but I see that it now also has 2 sensors...and from all the customer reviews...'eats' batteries. The OLD PZ-1100 was a good unit and the battery life has been exceptional.

Too bad the design has changed...and for that reason I guess I will go back to the tennis ball for my wife's car. I notice from reading all the customer reviews that I am not alone in my thinking and that many people wish they could also get the OLD PZ-1100.

I would NOT recommend buying either Park Zone!!!!",1.0
This parking device turned out to be completely useless because its sensor does not work correctly within the range of 1.3 feet - manual states that and I observed that as well. If I would not need to park the car closer than 1.3 feet to garage wall then I would not need this device at the first place.,1.0
"I purchased the Park-Zone PZ-1500 for my Father-in-Law for father's day and upon installing the device in his garage found that it would not work.

The difference was startling. My old one had a reliable green, yellow, red sequence. Red came on reliably at the same point. This unit did not. The picture with the light pushed through the garage wall that someone posted said it all. It is completely unreliable. It usually does nothing until the red light comes on and then you have no idea whether the car is in the right spot or not. I took it off and repaired my old unit instead.",1.0
"I have the 2-sensor version and it hardly ever works.  Every now and then the lights will go from green to red as advertised, but sometimes it will just sit at yellow even after you have passed the safe point.  In fact, today, mine stayed yellow so I advanced the car and completely obliterated the sensor with the cars bumper.  After the sensor was completely crushed, it still read yellow, and it never changed to red.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I went and ordered another one, this time the version with only 1-sensor.  I'm hoping that the reviews below are accurate and the 1-sensor version is much better.",1.0
"I purchased 2 of the Park Zone 1500 based on my neighbors experience with an older model. The older model has one sensor and works great all of the time. The new model that I received has two sensors and works sporadically at best. I have at least twenty holes in the wall from trying to get a suitable location for the sensors. I have a car and a minivan and when I enter the garage with either, end up backing in and out several times just to get the unit to light up. My neighbors goes from green to yellow then red every time. Very disappointed.",1.0
I bought 2 of these for my garage.  They functioned fine until after a few months one quit working.  I did not bother sending it back because it wasn't worth the effort.  The other quit working before it was a year old.  Neither works with battery or AC power.  I wish had saved my money and used a tennis ball on a string instead of this gadget.,1.0
"This thing is completely unreliable.  I tried a variety of sensor heights and distances, and THREE DIFFERENT CARS.  I moved everything else away from the sensor but the red light would not come on.  I could have driven right through the wall without it telling me to stop.

Apparently, based on the other reviews, a few people have gotten lucky, but there are also plenty of other people like me for whom it would not work at all.  The odds aren't in your favor.",1.0
The new model has two sensors as opposed to one larger sensor on the original model. The original is problem free while the new seems to have problems finding the car.,1.0

"I've owned this device for about six months now.  I installed it according to manufacturer's recommendations.  My garage is clean and new.  The device is unable to reliably detect the position of our honda odyssey.  It appears to calibrate the initial position fine, which is about 3 feet from the wall.  But any subsequent attempts to park only produce a yellow light as I get less than a foot from the wall.  I presume that it is a problem with the sharp nose of our van.  I rigged up a bracket to angle the transmitter at about a 45 degree angle from the wall at a height of about five feet from the floor in hopes of reflecting the ultrasound better off the angled hood of our van, but this only marginally improved things.  Overall, I can't rely on it to safely park our car.  I should have returned it.",1.0
"I don't have easy access to electrical outlets on the far side of my garage, and I don't want to be running wires everywhere, so I ran both of the units I bought of off Batteries. They worked great at first, but the battery life if very disapointing, I think because the don't go off quickly enough. To change the batteries you have to take it off the wall, and it loses its distance setting, so you need a second person to direct you while you pull in the car. After changing the batteries every month it seemed like, I got sick of it, both devices are still up on the but not being used. I'm going to look into the Laser of the stop stick.",1.0
I bought one via amazon.com by auto alley.  Had problems from the start.  Did not work on AC power.  Maybe because the power supply put out 15.6 volts instead of 9 volts listed.  Even 9 volts seemed high when the unit takes 4AA batteries or 1.3 volt x 4 = 5.2 volts.  Unit did not set up at all on AC power but did on batteries.  Even than the Green light did not light when parking though the yellow and red did. Could park this way but definitely a bad product.  Called auto alley and they stated they had many problems with this unit.  Last heard from.,1.0
"I tried this unit for about two weeks and finally returned it.

The unit never seems to sense the car properly as it enters the garage. The green light never came on while approaching, and then finally the yellow would light shortly followed by the red. The performance was intermittent, in my opinion, and we decided that placing a mark on the wall was just as good and costs nothing. I can't recommend this device based on it's sub-par performance.

Data: Car type, Toyota Solara

 Distance for calibration to car: 3 feet.

 Distance between transceiver to floor: 2 feet

This thing really doesn't work. The red light went on AFTER I hit everything I was trying to avoid. Go VERY SLOW or you will end up on the other side of your garage wall. I now use mine as a stopper for the front wheel. Save yourself some money and buy a tennis ball and some string.,1.0

"Installed this item, but instead of allowing me to pull all the way into the garage before the red light comes on, the red light comes on with my truck sticking 2 feet out of the garage.  Tried to reset several times and rework it.  Still stoped me too far back.  The battery operated version of this item states the batteries should last for up to a year - yeah, right.  I have to change the batteries every month or 2.",1.0
"I found this ""precision parking device"" on clearance sale at Target for $5, so I figured I'd give it a try. You know the truism/cliche "" you get what you pay for""? It definitely applies here. Construction is cheap, design is awkward. Even $5 was too much to pay for this craptastic device. Mine worked fine for a week or two, then sporadically for another week before it failed completely and was moved to the trash... ""precisely"" where it belongs. Don't waste your money!",1.0
"This comes with a surprisingly long ""instructions"" pamphlet which mostly just goes on and on and on about how this is so easy to install.  And it is very easy.  Just put it up, plug it in, and it calibrates automatically.

The trouble is, if that doesn't work, the complete lack of things you can do renders it entirely useless.  I wasted hours trying to move the car, change the position of the sensor, unplug and replug to get it to recalibrate, etc. and no matter what I did, it consistently proved useless.  Most of the time the lights don't even come on, or it gets to yellow when I'm all the way in the garage, but sometimes it goes to red while I'm still barely with the nose in.

The only really useful suggestion they offer for how to correct this kind of problem is to change the height of the sensor, but they provide very little by way of guidelines of what height to move it to.  I followed their guidelines, then tried various other heights.  For my efforts, I now have a lot of unnecessary screw-holes in my wall.  None of them helped, though.

For all I know, I got a bad unit somehow, but in their quest to make this easy to install by removing all control the user has over it, they made it impossible to even tell.  If you get lucky and it happens to be able to find your car like they intend, you'll get great use from this.  If you don't, there won't be a single thing you can do about it.  Feeling lucky?",1.0
"I live in a townhome so I have a very small one car garage. I have a small tool chest and workbench along the back of the garage and there is really only wnough room for my car. I honestly only have about a 6 inch space between my car and the garage door and my tool chest. As you can understand, I need something to make sure my car is in the same exact place every day. I bought this from Brookstone in a mall around christmas time of last year. It only worked for a couple of months and now it doesnt light up at all. You can click the only button at the top to reset it, but it does not remember the setting. I unplugged it and then it started to work for a couple of days and now if you back up it seems to work when it shows green, then it shows yellow and as you slowly back up it starts to blink a couple of times and shuts off. Now I just open my door and stop a couple of inches in front of a crack in my garage.

"I bought the Park-Zone PZ-1500 Platinum Edition parking aid for my wife in early March of 2005 from Amazon.com.

Installation and initial calibration was quick and easy, and it worked fine for about a couple of weeks. Then it started going nuts with the lights winking in random order. After that, it started flashing red indicating it needs new batteries. So I put a fresh set of batteries in the unit, recalibrated it, and we were good to go until a couple of days ago. That's when it would have a solid yellow light that would stay on for minutes at a time. Now it flashes red, and is telling me it wants fresh batteries. No more batteries for this dud. I was planning on using the AC adapter once I got an electrical outlet installed nearby; but that is a moot point now.

The Park-Zone receives my ""Just say NO to Chinese made crap!"" seal of disapproval.

If you want an effective parking aid that will positively park your car in the same place everytime, then (...)They come in yellow or blue. The curb may cost more than the Park-Zone, and the shipping is not free; but the curb works. I have one for my truck and compact tractor, and I just ordered one for my wife's car.

Great parking concept. ours is 15 months old and works great. the issue we have is that the THE PARK ZONE OWNERS MANUAL STATES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARK YOUR CAR FOR ONE YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES!!!THIS STATEMENT IS INCORRECT.

I bought this three years ago and seldom used it as it was hard to hold on the tire stem. Today I got it out of my van center storage area and it just would not light up. I thought the two button back light batteries were dead so I got them out and tested them. they are fully charged.

"I purchased this as i wanted an accurate tire pressure gauge. The gauge itself is well designed and is great. The problem is that it will not seal to the tire.

"I've had this gauge for a few years, but stopped using it with any regularity pretty quickly. Worked great the first few months, then the plastic tip wore out and no longer stayed centered in the hole, and it now takes several tries to get a good seal and thus a good reading. The rubber shroud over the tip slips forward and gets in the way as you push ever harder, trying to get a good seal and bleeding off pressure with every try.

Don't waste your money. I just ordered an Accu-Gage, with a real brass tip, made and calibrated in the good ole USA.",1.0
The rubber sleeve on the business end rides up and gets in the way of getting a good seal on the valve stem. Its also a too fat and requires a certain angle which makes it hard to get a reading from hard to reach valve stems like on my motorcycle.,1.0

with a hard plastic surface just plain awful.",1.0
Was not impressed with this item. recieved it new in package and decided to test it againts a mechanical tire gauge. Air pressures varied or couldn't get a reading. Somtimes  showed lower or higher than I expected. Is a piece of junk since it seemed to work better after having to buy new batteries.  I should get a refund  on this,1.0
Being a mechanic I should have known better. This tire gage is not only the worst tire gage I have ever bought but it is the worst tool I had ever bought. After the third use it leaked to the point where I had to reinflate my tires and recheck them with a simple yet always reliable analog gage. Not only that but I compared the accuracy with a calibrated gage from my shop and found the accutire gage was up to 5 psi off. Take some advice from a mechanic/sucker the simpler the better.,1.0
"I bought this item and then returned it. The gauge didn't seal very well on the tire stems in both my cars of different makes (8 stems in total!!) and let out a large amount of air. When it does seal, the readings had large differences between consecutive reads.",1.0
"In addition to the previously discussed problem of getting a good seal, I tried to use it the other day, and found it is totally dead. Replacing the button cells did not correct the problem. Seems the lithium battery failed prematurely. Considering the seal problem, I doubt I will bother to pay shipping & insurance to return it to the manufacturer for repair even if it is within the 5 year warranty.",1.0
I had an older Accutire that did not work well on my new car. I figured it was worn out and ordered this Gauge. It doesn't work either. It is impossible to maintain a good seal between the valve and the gauge. Instead of investing in fancy backlight etc. Accutire would have done much better by using a high quality sealing mechanism and not that flimiscal plastic/rubber combination. Using a different Gauge with a solid brass/metal connector I have no trouble at all. In short: I do not recommend.,1.0
"While the gauge itself is accurate, the center plastic tip wears out after about a year of use rendering the unit inoperable.  Should have used a metal tip.  Sorry I spent the money.",1.0
"This miracle of modern science works great the first 10 or 20 or 30 times.
Then you realize that readings are becoming increasingly inaccurate (and hard to obtain -- pfffffft!), and it's obvious that the $0.03 seal at the tip is failing.  Where do you get a replacement?  Ha, gotcha!
All show, no go at this point.",1.0
"Long on looks but short on durability and quality of material.  With use, it becomes more and more difficult to get a good seal between the guage and your valve stem because: (1) the outer rubber sleeve on the tip of the guage tends to slide when you press the guage against the valve stem of your tires; and (2) the actual piece of the guage that makes contact with the center of your valve stem is made of plastic, not metal, and it wears out rather quickly.  The result is that my guage does not even work due to worn parts after only one year of moderate use.  Although now useless, the guage looks so nice I still have not thrown it away.  Maybe I will use it as a paperweight!",1.0
"Great idea, gauge no workie! No instructions for re-setting (not Zero set) just -0.0 staring back at me. Worse! No website with which to lodge a complaint or ask for help (even though it's not rocket science). C'mon guys, it's 2003! I must be one of the unlucky ones or just unbearably grumpy.",1.0

So it has to be continuously removed for night driving- that is if you can somehow make it stay up for that long!

The next day I came home after work, and my MDX's headlights were flickering like a SOS signal.  What happened was my wife left the lights on, and because the inverter was plugged in and turned on, it bypassed the power-saving mode and the headlights were draining juice from the battery. I immediately went to unplug it and guessed what? IT'S STUCK! I gave it a hard pull, and the stupid plastic tip broke, leaving my battery bleeding out like a stabbing victim.  I ended up cutting the inverter's cord to bypass the antitheft system, then after yelling with my wife for not know to how to use the auto headlight mode, I duct-taped it back so I can salvage my $25.  So now the thing works, but it's stuck in there like a bullet fragment the doctor does not want to touch.  By the way if you're wondering, the car's battery is fine.

Thinking maybe I just got a bad kit the first time,I tried again (on a 60 psi tire)only to get the same results...Fooled me twice,Shame on me.",1.0
"It came with 20 patches. Only one would come off the backing; the other 19 tore backing off with them and so were unusable. The one that did come off did not seal well enough to keep air out, even though it scuffed with the included scuffer in different directions and rubbed it on thoroughly.",1.0
"Totally rip off. by the time you put the bike together, it is already flat. Try to patch the hole few times, still did not work. Should have known better.",1.0
Horrible kit. Patches do not stick at all.,1.0
"Looks ok until you pump up the tire, the the patch comes right off.  Guess that is better then it coming off after putting it on the bike.  with out the glue mess = no stick/ no work",1.0
"I got a very small leak on a bicycle tube.  Too small to see, but could feel the air.  I followed the directions exactly, then slowly pumped up the tube.  It was flat by the next day.  I removed the patch, then repeated the repair.  This time, I used a rubber roller to firmly press the patch to the tube.  Same results - in less than 24 hours, the tube was deflated.  Do not waste your money or time with this kit.",1.0
"This is a really insulting hashed together kit with vaguely useful nonsensically tiny tire levers.

metal abrasive material to scuff the rubber, and some pre adhesive applied, patches.

I really hope these poor reviews can stand as a guide to some at least to not purchase.
They simply do not work. You will have as much luck using scotch tape as you will with these patches. They do not stick or adhere in any way. They peel up upon any additional inflation or deflation.
They are incredibly thin unstretchable plastic round discs with no adhesive qualities beyond gift wrap tape.

If we are to give them the benefit of the doubt, then I can only presume that they age poorly? Something surely has to explain how they are able to continue to sell these without being sued.",1.0
Didn't work at all.  Then found out a neighbor used it and got scammed as well.  I might as well have just taken a $5 bill and put it straight in the trash can because the effect is the same.  Actually it is worse now because my carbon footprint is now larger by having this inferior product in my house.,1.0
"My wife picked these up at Walmart, and I tried them since I didn't have any ""real"" patches available.  Held pressure just long enough to reassemble the tire, and then went flat.  It's pretty obvious when you put one on that it's unlikely to perform as well as a glued on patch.  Not sure why companies make things like this that they must know are inferior!",1.0
"I went to Walmart to pick up tire patches, and I decided this was a better deal than the other brand which only had 6 patches (and no levers) for about half the price.  Once I got home and opened the pack, I realized that these are the same horrible useless stickers that I bought last year.  They are wretchedly bad.  I have even tried putting several of them on and around a hole, but they still leak air.  What happened to the good old-fashioned thick patches with rubber cement?  Those things always worked.",1.0
"This is an example of a product for which the manufacturer has sourced the very cheapest suppliers they can find, in the interest of making money, and then succeeding only in making a product that is unusable. The transparent plastic patches are nearly impossible to remove from the paper backing. But worse, the tire levers are made with such cheap, flimsy plastic that you cannot use them to get your tire back on the rim; they bend against the force of the tire bead. Do not waste your money.",1.0
"I bought one of this, it is really easy to used, it also easy to remove the patches don't really stick, when i try to put some air on my tube the patches won't hold the air. And i try and try until all patches is gone, was so disappointed on this product..its a waste ..anyone who bought this item deserve a refund...",1.0
"Doesnt work. It does nothing. Once hooked up it says to let the battery charge for ten minutes. I did, and it did nothing. So I let it charge for another 30 minutes and it still did nothing. So I disconnected it and tried jumping my truck with regular jumper cables and it started up as soon as they were connected. If you still want to throw your money away after reading this, send it to me and Ill mail you the useless unit I bought.",1.0
"While I appreciated other reviewers comments on this device, the Wagan unit I received was used 31 days following the 30 days for return under Amazon/Wagan policy. This first use resulted in not begin able to start the car. In contacting Wagan who replied with a prompt courteous email stated the device would not work if the battery was dead. Clearly I had no way to determine if the battery was dead or not, but simply that the car would not crank, but the lights both interior and headlights worked. However I ended up having to call AAA and got them to perform a jump start. So if you plan on purchasing this device when you car will not start, I would forget buying this and instead either buy a Genius GB-40 which was used by the response truck and started the car almost instantaneously, OR subscribe to a service like AAA. Don't take this risk, especially in today's times. By the way Amazon was very helpful in resolving this and the manufacturer was not.",1.0

"I couldn't get my hood open, dead battery, had to get to work.  I read all the reviews, followed tips/instructions, but the thing started *smoking* and smelled like an electrical fire. Soo... got a ride to work...  eventually got the hood open, bought a new battery, and forgot about this contraption.  I don't even want to give it to anyone or take it to the Goodwill, because, in my experience, it is a freaking fire hazard.",1.0

"I needed a bird cage for the reception of my wedding. I wanted something very autumn like, but everything that was in that range was $50+. I bought this for much cheaper, then hit it with some antique gold paint. After that, I roughed it up with light sandpaper shabby-chic style and put a handmade bow on top. Half the price of storebought fall-themed birdcages and much nicer. This is very well made, and easily customizable.",5.0
"I'd ordered a couple of different card holders for an event. This one by far exceeded quality in comparison to the cardboard ones. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it didn't suit my needs as it was a little small but I would totally recommend this box. It's elegant, sturdy and very nice to look at.",5.0
Very nice for the price. It was used for my son's wedding in June and will be used in my daughter's wedding in April.,5.0
I bought this for my nieces wedding. We put ribbons on it and had it on the present table. Perfect for all the cards so they don't get lost.,5.0
I needed this for our wedding cards. The price was excellent. Its so pretty I plan to re-purpose it into seasonal house/outdoor decor. I'm very happy with it.,5.0
"We used this on the gift table for cards at a wedding reception. It did the job very well. Although the holder has some decorative interest, it was easy to further decorate it with artificial flowers in the ""wedding colors"". Also the top opens on small hinges and the person decorating it propped the top partially open so that persons did not have to open it each time they put an envelope inside. With its design, the holder is easy to decorate if desired.",5.0
It was a perfect addition for wedding cards received at the reception.  Well made and much more durable than expected.  And much better than the paper boxes that I see advertised.,5.0
I am using this for my wedding so I added ribbons and flowers and it is beautiful. Glad I purchased it.,5.0
We used this for a graduation party.  It looked so stylish on the table and worked wonderfully.  It added a touch of elegance.,5.0

and she loves it also. She will be returning to the Philippines for her wedding. I'm her mom

glad I ordered this.",5.0
Getting this cage was a great idea and beautiful addition to our wedding. The cage is lightweight but sturdy. The clasp is strong.,5.0
I ordered this for my upcoming wedding to use for gift cards. It is a great size - I like the fact that the side slots are large enough to slide larger cards into. Good quality. It was easy to decorate.  Maybe I will use it for a planter afterwards! Super fast delivery- very pleased.,5.0
Placed this on an sparkly teal organza runner and glued sheer/sparkly teal & silver ribbon.  Just gorgeous and so much nicer than cardboard gift boxes!!,5.0
I bought this to hold the cards for my wedding. I haven't used it yet but it looks like it's going to work out great. Plus you can decorate it with ribbon or rose petals.,5.0

"The bird cage its well made. No chips or discolorations. it does not have a slit to insert the cards, you have to open the top. The cage is about 1 ft tall. Not many cards will fit but its so pretty its worth while to buy.",5.0
This cage worked great. We decorated it and made it look fantastic for our wedding. The price was great compared to the card holders that we could have purchased,5.0
we purchased this for my sisters wedding reception.  my mother jazzed it up with a bow and viola it was good to go.  it looked cute on the gift table.,5.0
This was a very nice card holder and looked great at my reception. It went very well with my lovebird themed wedding. I would recommend it.,5.0

"nos encanto el producto es algo novedoso para una fiesta de 15 a&ntilde;os es algo fuera de lo comun aca en venezuela,",5.0
This was the perfect size cage for placement on a table at our wedding reception.  Bird cage look without birdcage size.  I painted it with 'oil rubbed bronze' spray paint because it wasn't available in colors other then white.  I've added a picture to show the finished product.,5.0
"It was a perfect size and unique, instead of birdcage type.  We used it for 60th Wed. Anniv. Celebration for my parents.",5.0
"This product gets five stars because it's exactly what it's advertised to be: a wire bird cage-style card holder (the type that's so fashionable at weddings these days).  The top portion of the card holder is hinged and easily opens and closes.  It also can be locked (lock of your choice sold separately) in case any unsavory individuals show up to your wedding/event (I'm looking at you, hotel bartender with the goatee who keeps making eyes at the maid of honor!).  It decorates easily with ribbon / flowers to match your color scheme.

My only caveat about this card holder would be its actual size - it's small!  Today's wedding cards are much too big to lay flat in this card holder.  Also, many didn't even fit through the openings.  And, if you have a family of impatient drunks (don't judge), cards easily get backed up.  If you're having an event where you anticipate more than 20 - 25 cards, then please entertain other options.  This card holder would be great at a bridal or baby shower, but unless you're having a small to moderately-sized wedding this card holder ain't going to cut it.

Again, it's a great product; just make sure you're aware of the size and plan accordingly.",5.0
I bought this card holder along with some ribbon to dress it up. It's larger than I expected - more than enough room for our 90 guests to insert cards. The quality is good and the price is right. Better than the cardboard variety I think.,5.0
"We found this on clearance at Wal Mart.  It is very detailed, well made, & appears to definitely serve its purpose.  We were going to purchase a similar one elsewhere, because it was larger & less expensive than this item would have been had it not been on sale.  We are on a serious budget, so we went with this shorter, less expensive one.  Check the measurements before your purchase.  It should be fine for us as long as no one tries to put any large envelopes in there.",5.0
"This is gorgeous!!!
I have gotten so many compliments already.
I filled the bottom of the cage with glossy/shiny shreds of paper that matched my wedding color.",5.0
"I had a wishing well wedding, we just asked for cash and blessings from our guests! Which I HIGHLY recommend! This bird cage was the answer! Our reception was Art Decco themed and this went swimmingly with the room decor. We had 110 guests and all but 3 gave us cards with money! All the cards fit and it looked so cute! My sister decorated it to go along with the theme too. I'm so glad I purchased this. And, it is not expensive and arrived very quickly!",5.0

"Amazon printable gift cards are convenient and unique.  I was able to personalize the message on my cards and was able to choose what ""theme"" I wanted to place on the front of it.  I had them printed out and placed in my envelopes in less than 10 minutes.  By giving an Amazon gift card, it allows the user to purchase anything they want.  That is why I purchased them for my employees.  The only suggestion I would give to the website, is to list the code that is unique to each card on the memo portion, next to the ""print now"" button.  I purchased multiple cards and wanted to double check to make sure I print out each of them.  I had to open each card to compare the codes that were printed.  It would have made this process easier if the code was on the memo portion.  I plan to purchase more cards in the future because of the convenience and because each of my employees were happy.  They work hard and deserve to receive a gift they can use.",5.0

The Print-at-Home Amazon gift cards are a great way to reward employees for their years of service.  Employees pick out something they want and need vs. receiving a plaque or other gift they have no interest for.  Printing the gift cards is a quick way to take care of this when there are so many details a HR Director has to keep up with.  No follow-up needed; place the order and voila! they're ready to print to present to employees.,5.0

"I thought an Amazon GC would be perfect for those in my family that love to listen to audiobooks.  Boy was I wrong.  Amazon GCs do NOT WORK with audible.com accounts, even though audible has amazon branding all over it.  I'm sure the recipient will be more than willing to use it at amazon to buy some odd trinket or other, but that defeats the spirit in which the gift was given.  Last time I even think about buying GCs with amazon until they correct their systems so that all companies across the board accept legal amazon tender.  I already do not like the concept re: GCs because it forces someone to purchase with a specific company, I especially HATE GCs that force someoen to purchase within a specific division of a company.",1.0

"*DO NOT BUY* Purchased 20 $50.00 Amazon gift cards ($1000.00 worth) through this site with the ""Thank You"" cards attached for employees at work. I've been an Amazon customer for over a decade. All the gift cards were claimed when I asked all the employees to check their claim codes after one staff member complained her's wasn't usable. I called customer service, received the same ""call your bank"" email response. I called again this time extremely frustrated. They escalated it to the gift card/escalation department. They had me prove to them that all 20 gift cards were compromised. I asked all 20 employees to take photo copies of their cards, where then I prepared a document showing all 20 card numbers with detailed explanation. In short, I had to ""work for it"" - proving that indeed, they're careless service of not checking these card numbers were recycled and unusable. When I mentioned a couple of times, ""Do you guys read your comments on how most of these gift cards have the same complaints?"" They acted clueless. Also, they only do customer service responses via email, even after repeated requests for them to call me back - they never do. You have to initiate phone contact. After over two weeks, and constant nagging on my end, I did receive the amount back, but not in the form of 20 gift cards as I originally intended to give as employee gifts, but a credit on one account. Are they expecting me to purchase more gift cards from this site to give to the employees? What do they expect me to do now that the money is on just one Amazon account?

Back to online chat and then come to find out the RECIPIENT needs an account with Amazon to get a card in their email - that it will not go through if there is no account associated with the card (???). I ended up (after about two hours of this back and forth not to mention I was asked to ask my niece to check various inboxes, etc..) cancelling the card. I went back and looked, nowhere does it mention that the person getting the card also needs an account. So my niece gets nothing from me, I get to feel terrible I missed her birthday.

"Do not buy an Amazon egift card. Their security is so poor that the balance gets redeemed before the intended recipient gets it! When the person you gifted the card to tries to redeem it the card shows $0.00 balance. Whoever BB Wells is, you are a low life thief, if that is even your real name. Don't spend it all in one place.

They don't give you a complaint number or anything either so when you try to reply to check on it you have to go through the whole process with someone new and they tell you the same thing the last person did.

Heed the warnings from all the people saying they bought a card and an unknown person redeemed it. Amazon will not help you. I saw the same warnings and ignored them because I figured I could count on Amazon if anything happened. I was wrong. I wish I could give this less than one star.",1.0

I specifically purchased the e- gift card for convenience. It ended up not being able to be redeemed unless it was through my own account.

"I had a bad experience this time. I live in Canada and my sister lives in the USA.
She has a Kindle, which in my experience has always been a product you could only purchase
in the USA.  I was shopping at my grocery store (Real Canadian Superstore) and was very
excited to see I could buy Kindle gift cards. So I bought $100 worth and mailed them to my sister
for a birthday gift.

Once she received them, she told me she couldn't use them. She said someone had given
them to her before after purchasing them in Canada and she couldn't use them for that reason.

So she mailed them back to me, unused, untouched. I tried to take them back to the store and
they told me they would not refund me because Amazon won't take them.

In the meantime, I purchased $100 of Kindle giftcards online and emailed them to her and she
is using them.

I am stuck with these Kindle gift cards that can only be used in Canada and cannot use them.

I am frustrated and will probably not purchase gift cards from Amazon again. It's a ridiculous

It's nice to be able to keep up with the oral hygiene without having to lug around a bottle of mouthwash (which, is primarily water, and water is heavy).

I have used this product before so I knew I loved it. It is disappointing that the accelerator is so much more expensive than it was a few years back.

"This stuff is the best. I like all the flavors, but Green Apple is my fave. So different and refreshing. But the main point is the clean, clean, clean feeling I get from using Supersmile.

"I'm SO glad I decided to try this toothpaste! Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle! I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste!
My teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!).
I drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!

The mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.

My teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.

I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.

I went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.

This is my HG toothpaste and I recommend it to all my friends and family as well. It's pretty amazing stuff.",5.0

I brushed my teeth the first night and didn't notice much. But in the morning, I saw already noticeable fading in the dark stains of my teeth! 2 weeks later, friends are asking if I got my teeth bleached!! I will never use another toothpaste or whitening product!",5.0

"Have been using this for over 12 years and even though it's on the expensive side, it's well worth the money for the quality of the product.  My dentist thought I quit smoking and drinking coffee after I started using this,  he couldn't believe that a toothpaste was that effective at stain removal and cavity protection!!  One tube lasts a long time and I use just a pea size amount as directed on a DRY round tip electric toothbrush.  Hope they never discontinue this product!",5.0
"Dentist recommended so I bought, can't say my teeth are any whiter, but the case is not overwhelming and I hope the fluoride is making my teeth stronger. Can't say the high price is justified, the benefits are likely more theoretical but if you have the bucks, go for it.  Don't see how you can be hurt by it.",5.0

"I started buying this some years ago after I quit smoking. My teeth are resistant to whitening, I drank iced tea daily and had smoked for 30 years. I've never had a cavity and other than the embarrassing staining, I've had really good oral health. The first time I used this, I thought I noticed a difference but wasn't sure. Within three days though (I brush twice a day and floss) there was a definite improvement. It's quite noticeable.

I used two tubes to whiten my teeth and then I brushed with Super Smile twice a week or so, to maintain it. My teeth weren't blazing, TV white but they were a far bit whiter than they were. I also used the mouthwash intermittently. I had better results when I switch to a Sonic Care electric tooth brush too. Just an inexpensive model was fine.  It's been a while and it's time to whiten again so, yeah. But I've tried other tooth pastes that claim to effect change and this is the only one, of the many which I've tried, that delivers.",5.0

I noticed a change in shade of my teeth in less than one week!!  And they are almost pearly looking, not just clean.  I will never go back!  I have to say if you like a stronger taste order the Icy Mint flavor.  I had to exchange my regular flavor for this one.",5.0

"Easy to use whitening toothpaste that makes a huge difference if you are a coffee drinker. In my opinion, this toothpaste's effectiveness increases if you use it at night before going to bed as you will have had a full day's worth of meals and activities. The flavor of this toothpaste isn't overpowering (I used the mint) and the consistency of this toothpaste is as most other toothpastes.

Personally, I saw results after two weeks of consistent use. I also didn't notice any tooth sensitivity after my usage (as I have with other whitening products).",5.0

"I hate whitening strips. No matter how advanced Crest has gotten, I still obsess about the filmy gooey thing stuck to my teeth. I inevitably keep touching it with my tongue and thus eating half of the whitening gel before I can't stand it anymore and remove the strip. This toothpaste is a welcome alternative that actually worked!! I have sensitive teeth, so I only used it once a day but I definitely noticed results after a couple weeks of use. My teeth did end up feeling a little sensitive after those weeks, so I switched to a sensitive toothpaste and have been alternating since!",5.0
Really like this toothpaste.,5.0
This stuff is great and truly whitens in a very short amount of time. I am about to purchase again because we are almost out. Use as recommended you do not need more than a pea size on your brush and for best results do not rinse under water before you brush. When you brush without water it allows for the chemicals to do what they are designed to do. Take this advice for what it is as you will not regret it.,5.0
I really like this tooth paste. I would recommend it,5.0
"WHEN USED WITH THE WHITENING ACCELERATOR, IT DOES A VERY GOOD JOB",5.0
My teeth were noticeable whiter after just a week & continue to look great. I've received so many compliments on them. I will continue to use this once a day along with my regular toothpaste due to other people saying they have cavities from using this solely. I just switch up throughout the day. I haven't experienced any sensitivity. However my friend is also using this and she has whiter teeth but has very little sensitivity as well. She will continue to use this as well. So I would say this definitely works.,5.0
so glad to find these at Amazon. Love the results.,5.0

"I've tried plenty of other whitening toothpastes before, but this is the first one that I can say absolutely, unequivocally does what it says. Within a week, stains that had been on my teeth for probably years just lifted off like they were nothing. It's a little pricey, but in my honest opinion definitely worth the cost!",5.0
great stuff,5.0
"Best whitening toothpaste out there. Great for teeth that are sensitive to other whitening pastes. I've seen a few negative reviews and think they might be due to improper use of the product. It needs to be used on a completely dry toothbrush, without rinsing your mouth before it after use, and no drinking/eating for AT LEAST half an hour after use. It might be different to use, but it works wonders. My teeth are super white, and I get great dental checkups every time.",5.0

This product removes some of the polish as you apply it.  I tried it a second time and let the underlying polish dry for more than 1 hour before applying the top coat and it still removed color.  Don't recommend!,1.0

Very disappointed this is how I received this polish obviously it was broken when placed in the box . even the inside of the primer has pink polish,1.0
I dispute the claim of being super shiny. These polishes are no more shiny than any other. Don't buy the hype. OPI I expect more of them.,1.0
"This is not the right picture! I thought I was ordering the color in this picture which I love. Instead the real ""to the finish lime"" color is so ugly.

Way to light in color.  I was hoping for a more natural nail color.  I gave the polish to my granddaughter.,1.0
"Ok - more than 2 stars for delivery of product.  it was ontime, and delivered safely.

Less than 1 star for seller.  I sent note to ask for a refund.  I never heard back.

1 star for product itself....
- I tried 3 times with this polish at my salon (I always bring my own color --to do touch ups at home in between )
---- THe color 'puckered' on my nails each time.  Bubbles in the polish.  Hard to explain in words.  But not a sheen smooth finish at all
---- Could not get the color to dry on some nails, so it had big smugdes
---- Chipped within a day
---- So poor after 5 days, I went back for a polish change

After going back for 3rd polish change, I gave up on the jar.  But the seller never got back to me.

Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don't waste your money!,1.0
Its dull and after it goes on it bubbles in places and looks gloppy. Had to use other top coat to cover and make it shine. Will never use this OPI gel again and think it was released too early maybe. Contacted OPI about it but never even got an acknowledgement of email.,1.0
"I have already used the opi Infinite shine twice in a week. It is terrible. I used the primer, Polish, and gloss. The polish was the You can count on it pink. It is ugly, gloppy, thick and streaky.  The gloss doesn't even shine it started chipping the next day!  Don't buy it, it is overpriced and doesn't work!",1.0
"I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product.  I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!.  The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application.  I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great.  The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day.  What a disappointment!  I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.",1.0

At first I thought I was missing the ends of my nails. But I reapplied one last time today. Sat for over an hour to let them dry. About 10 mins of normal activity and tips of my nails were completely bare again. It just peels back from my nails like a weird jelly film.,1.0

"I bought this nail polish from Amazon after choosing it during a salon pedicure. I had no trouble with the delivery, but after using it on my nails, I questioned whether it was authentic or previously used. First, the level of polish in the bottle was low. I had to put the brush all the way back in before I would get an adequate amount of polish. Second, it was crusty around the opening like it had been open and used several times. Third, while the color was what I remembered, the overall quality of the polish itself was unlike OPI products I've used in the past. It seemed watered down and thin to put it simply. Since there wasn't a price difference, I would probably just buy OPI directly from a salon or other more reputable source.",1.0
FOR 16.98 I RECEIVED ONE BOTTLE-I THOUGHT THE TITLE SAID 2.  I WILL NOT USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!  I CAN GET ONE BOTTLE FOR $7 OR $8 DOLLARS.,1.0
"Product came and was old-- nail polish was goopy, streaky, and unusable.",1.0
This is terrible. I do not know why but it bubbled which either means it's really old or a knock off . Ruined my manicure every time I used it. Money wasted.,1.0
I bought this color a while ago. I went to use it recently and it was hard as rock in the glass bottle. I've never had this happen to my other OPI polishes. Really disappointed and thinking I should jus stick with buying my colors in store rather than online. Who knows if it was even brand new.,1.0
My wife bought this nailpolish and complained about it cause it doesn't last even 2 days.,1.0
"This top coat's ancestors probably mated with sea foam or something because all I get are freaking bubbles everywhere every time. I think I'm actually better off without top coat now, at least with this thing.",1.0
"This product is a beautiful bright blue with tons of glitter in it. The only thing I don't like about it isn't about the color it's about the brush. The brush is super short and quite wide which makes putting on the polish a difficult and messy task. The brush is too wide in my opinion. It's not the same brush that regular OPI polishes have. It's much shorter and wider. I do not like it. Other than that it's great!

The shape of the bottle is quite odd, I certainly wasn't expecting a ""deformed"" bottle but that's how it's made so oh well. I think that once the polish is used up a bit the shape of the bottle and the brush will make it unusable unless you close the bottle shake it then reopen it for each nail. That's a big disappointment.

The glitter is very dense making the nail feel rough even with 2 coats of OPI Top Coat on top. OPI's other glittery nail polishes don't feel so rough even without a top coat on. But there must be a lot more glitter in this polish than the other standard OPI polishes. Overall I really like this polish and I do recommend it.

EDIT: (Oct 13, 2011) The nail polish peeled off of my nails the day after I applied it. I had just gotten out of a short bath and noticed they were peeling. What a rip off! I'm certainly not happy. The only things I had on my nails yesterday when I applied it was OPI natural nails base coat, two coats of the color and two coats of the OPI top coat. No lotion or oils on my nails prior to putting it on. What a bummer!",1.0
Product bubbles on your nails...looks terrible,1.0
I love OPI and its pretty much all i use. Color is pretty but Im assuming it was how it was stored its thick and doesnt apply right. Wasnt worth my effort to make it work this morning !!!!,1.0
"No stars for this product , it's 100 percent fake ,the brush is cheap and poor quality , don't buy this product ,waste of your money",1.0
This product is clearly not an authentic OPI product - it's a cheap knock-off.  There are noticeable differences between this bottle and authentic OPI bottles.  There is also a very harsh smell and the product bubbles on my nails.  This was not the case with the authentic OPI I had previously purchased (which is a fantastic product and worth the money). I should have realized OPI couldn't be this cheap. At least Amazon was great and made sure I got a refund for this product that wasn't what it claimed to be.,1.0
"Be careful who you buy this from. I'm about 98% sure the bottle I received is a knock off. I can tell it's cheap and it left bubbles on my nails. The bottle even looks different from the rest of my OPI products. The handle is smoother than the rest and the back of the bottle looks different as well. I'm very upset with this purchase.

Uploaded a pic so you can see the different in the bottles. The far right is the knock off.",1.0
"I bought this as a replacement for the Seche Vite top coat that I usually use (and love).  The store that I purchase from was out of Seche Vite, so I purchased this, thinking O.P.I. makes great quality polishes, so their top coat should perform well.  Very, very wrong.  This, to me, was no better than using a plain clear polish as a top coat (which does not serve the purpose of a top coat at all). It dries very slowly, pulls tacky nail polish color off, and chips very, very quickly - possibly more quickly than using no top coat at all.

If you're in the market for a good top coat, get Seche Vite. It's a similar price, you can apply it to tacky nail polish without any color coming off, and it dries to the touch in less than a minute. It also lasts for at least one week, without chipping.  This O.P.I. top coat chipped overnight, without me using my hands for anything other than normal activity: not even dish washing or a shower in that time.

Don't waste your money on this one.",1.0
"The colors of the OPI Burlesque series are sensational...however, the polish goes on makikng the nails feel as if there were sand paper on top of them.  It chips at the slightest touch, but removing from nails altogether is a major hassle...acetone polish required, and nails have to soak for at least one minute, then only 1/2 comes off, involving another soaking before all polish could be removed.  I bought four of these in different colors...have thrown them all out and I love OPI polish more than most.",1.0
It's a fun and glamorous product but directions/warning should come attached as to how hard it is to remove the product!  It took me 25 minutes and lots of remover and cotton to get the polish off!,1.0
"I really don't like glitter nail polish. This nail polish doesn't look glitter at all in the pictures, both here at Amazon and OPI's website. I was disappointed when I got the nail polish. Way too glitter for me, AND it's much darker than in the picture too.",1.0
Contains formaldehyde :(,1.0
Who knew Russian Navy is purple. Really disappointed.,1.0
One star due to the fact that the polish is not authentic. The bottle is not authentic OPI and it does not have its etched number on the bottle like its supposed to. The lettering on the bottle is dull and crooked and not raised to the touch as with authentic OPI polishes. Tried to return to seller but wanted me to pay shipping to have it returned back.,1.0

"Very runny, steaky, doesn't stay on for more then 2-3 days.",1.0
"Read the reviews, I wish I had. If you put it on thin (to dry, painted nails) it streaks your paint job. If you put it on thick, it takes hours to dry.  It then feels tacky and looks dull the next day. As someone else said, go with Sally Hansen top coat.",1.0
Its a gel nail polish... not what I wanted and not what is in the picture....,1.0

It's broken as you can see,1.0
Don't know if the polish was old. I purchased this for my Meme because she had been looking for this color and I found it here. She applied the color to her finger nails let dry and then it just scratched off after a shower. So not sure what's up with this because I know this brand is good never had issues in the past.,1.0
"Even after it dries.....it is sticky, and dries ""cloudy"".....I do not recommend this to anyone. Sorry OPI. I love  your products....but this one...I am not a fan of.",1.0
"I bought this to match a manicure in the same color. Unfortunately, this is not the same color. It claims it's ""Mod About You"", but it's more of a neon/Barbie pink instead of the pretty neutral pink it should be. Too bad it can't be returned as it's not the correct color.",1.0
Beware: the Russian Navy should be called Purple McPurpleton. I hate it. Waste of $8.,1.0

How is Russian NAVY purple & not the navy blue I have always used. Totally disappointed.,1.0
"The product i received was a fake, The code on the stick was sliced through and re-stamped with a different code. There is also no code imprinted on the bottle. Very unsatisfied.",1.0
After using this product I would suggest that you get the original Nail Envy over this. My nails have always been weak; they break easily and peel like no other. I tried the Dry & Brittle formula and found that when it dries it peels? It would flake off in a day or two. Stick to the original.,1.0
Pretty sure this was a fake/knockoff one its not the same as my other OPI polishes that I got from salons and it takes forever to dry.,1.0
Very watery and un-OPI like,1.0
Yes it dried but not super fast and it would cause my nail polish to chip faster and it was super expensive...not worth it!,1.0
"I bought this product thinking it was the regular O.P.I top coat, but I received the fast dry top coat instead. Generally fast dry nail polish doesn't make a big difference for me because fast dry or not it still takes too long for me. But this product actually dried very quickly! I was nervous because I had used a base coat and then very thick layers of the colored nail polish to finally finishing up with the top coat, and thought this would take forever to dry and I needed to go to sleep. But just a few minutes later I checked and it was almost perfectly dry!

Edit: Yes, this product dries really fast, but it doesn't last whatsoever! It's so bad you are better off not using any top coat at all! After only 1 or 2 days, you can literally peel the nail polish off your nail like those really cheap nail polishes or those toy nail polishes for little girls! I totally hate it. Waste of money",1.0

"So. First off I'd like to explain that this wasn't even the product I ordered. I wanted a Matte topcoat, and for some reason when I searched matte topcoats, this came up. I ordered it, not realizing that it was just a regular topcoat. I decided, what the hell, it was only six or seven bucks, might as well keep it. So I used it a few times. Every time that I have used this topcoat, it has caused the nail
polish underneath to form little bumps and bubbles. Instead of looking smooth and shiny, my nails end up bumpy and ugly. I have never had this issue with any other top coat, so I'm not sure what the issue is. I've stopped using it and went back to my other top coats and have had no issues since.",1.0
Came very clumpy. I had to throw it away.,1.0
"The one nice thing I have to say about the product is that this colour is really quite nice.

Now the bad:  I have used OPI polish twice, and both times my nails have become weak, brittle, and prone to break/chip/split.  The polish itself did not last.  I like to get hands-on with computers, so I'm used to wrecking my nails if I'm not careful, but this stuff chipped while I was typing.  I tried it with and without a top coat, and the top coat seemed to be weakened like my nails.

Worse, it comes off terribly.  A couple of fingers look like I tried to remove it with a coarse metal file.  I've ordered some nail therapy (local stores don't have any stocked) in hopes that maybe I can undo some of the damage.

I cannot say for a medical certainty that the paint is the problem.  I also can't say that it will happen to you.  With 75% positive reviews, I have trouble imagining everyone's nails are getting ruined.  But in 25 years of painting my nails, the only other time I had this happen was with cheap dollar store-type nail polish.  And this is a shame, because I really like the colour.",1.0

"Product is soooooo thin and runny. And also wasn't sealed when I got it.  It's obviously been mixed with something or is just not authentic OPI. It also won't dry on my nails Bc it's been ""watered"" down with remover. Can't return it.",1.0

I love OPI Russian Navy .. this is not the 1st bottle I've bought.  I couldn't find it locally so I went online.  The product I got was gloppy and unusable.

I was very disappointed in this. For some reason this color chips the same day you put it on. I even tried using a top coat. Color I like but chippinng I don't . Won't buy this one ever again,1.0
This is not the real mod about you. i used it on my toes and used the gel on my fingers and the color from this polish is much darker than the actual color it should be. it's more of a pepto bismol pink than a pale pink. I ordered this about a month ago and just used it and am not happy about it.,1.0

Also, the polish is the consistency of water. I showed it to my manicurist who laughed and said ""you've been ripped off."" Unfortunately it is too late to return this so i have just wasted my money ($9.50). It was overpriced for OPI anyway but I was willing to pay extra to get the color which I couldn't find locally at this time. Although this is in an OPI bottle, the label on the bottom of the bottle is not like any other OPI label that I have or have ever seen. It appears to be a counterfeit label. I did not open the package right away because I still had some of my original bottle left so now it is unfortunately too late to return the bottle for a refund.",1.0
"I bought this product to cover a tiny scar on my face and a few freckles. After reading the reviews, I was convinced to spend the extra dough on this product.
First of all, it's a pain in the butt to apply, you have to chisel it out of the container with the tiny plastic spatula they give you (and you will subsequently lose immediately), then put it on your hand and massage it with the tiny spatula until it becomes mushy -- It's gross! Not to mention messy and time-consuming.
However, I could deal with all this this if it actually worked like it was supposed to. It didn't cover any of my ""imperfections"" even though it was so heavy it made me look like a dime store dummy.

Sad to say that this product was a no-go for me. Became cakey and unsightly after an hour.

Definitely would not recommend for combination skin.,1.0
"This makeup is very very cakey and doesnt stay on even using a primer, my pores were out clear as day! It also lasted 3 hours before breaking up from around my t-zone.

This Dermablend Cover CremeFull Coverage foundation is very thick and hard to work with. At first I thought it was going to be smoother and work better but it was so thick. It started to almost peel off of my skin a little. It also stuck to my problem areas ( t zone ) and caked near the under eye. The color and pigmentation of the foundation was more on the warmer side. They are definitely darker than I thought it would be. I would personally It was on for an hour and was already becoming blotchy.,1.0
"Not what I expected at all. I bought this product to help camouflage a bruise and perhaps a tattoo. It did not cover to the degree I expected. The bruise and tattoo were still visible and after a couple of hours they were completely visible. It does not dry,  it stays tacky so a powder or setting spray is definitely needed. Is not water resistant. I would not recommend  this product for the price.  Any cake make up would do the same. I would not buy again. 40 bucks wasted.",1.0
My wife did not like this product. She said it was difficult to apply and did not feel comfortable on her skin. She said she would not  be using it again because it just did not do the job that she wanted it to perform..,1.0
"I am sure after using this product, that it is exactly what it touts to be.  That is a durable, full coverage foundation makeup.  Be sure that that is EXACTLY what you want because that is what you are going to get.
I am a fair complected senior citizen with very fair skin.  Still a few freckles.  What I don't need is a product like this one.  I think that this product is relatively easy to apply.  I followed the directions exactly.  There is a little spatula included and I used it to take a small amount of product (it only takes a little, believe me) and put it on the back of my hand.  Then I used my fingers to ""stir"" the product a little and then apply it to my face.  WOW!  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  Just remember that you can always add more but it is more difficult to take some away.
Several things of note here.
1) Much, much darker than I needed
2) Coverage is total.  I mean total.  You get a flawless look.  Rather like stage makeup with which I am familiar.
If that is what you want, fine.  Personally I prefer a more natural look.  If you too are looking for natural then this is not what you want.
Summary---I would prefer to use a concealer or cover up just on the spots where I might need it and not go for a total coverage foundation.  That is what this is and that is what you will be getting when you order this.",1.0

I purchased this foundation directly from the vendor website. Had high hopes. I have hyperpigmentation on my face And this foundation full coverage promised to cover them to a perfection. I warmed it up on my hand and work it on my face. I dab the first layer and reapply a second layer only on those areas where it was needed. It only looked dry and cakey. I could still see my dark spots. I was very disappointed. I try and try following the demos; but the results where always the same. Maybe it works for some people; it did not work for me.,1.0
I wouldnt recommend this to anyone because I need to put on a whole lot to cover my dark spots and it looks dry and chalky on my face too.,1.0
"Worst foundation ever. Goes on cakey and creases every where after 20 mins. This isn't a foundation that will last all day. I am a professional
Makeup artist I would not recommend this product to someone who wants all day flawless coverage. After a few hours it turns greasy and begins to smudge and crease and feel heavy all over your face. It's a noticeable foundation and really super heavy duty.  You're better off using mac studio fix liquid.",1.0

"How anyone could like this product is beyond me. It's pretty much Halloween makeup. It's thick - you need a spatula to scoop it out of the container- and it's greasy. After a few minutes on your face it's super shiny and oily feeling. Makes my already huge pores look even bigger, and does not cover freckles or melasma! I thought this could cover tattoos? So, you'd think it would be able to hide freckles? . No. It doesn't. Not even close.",1.0
"it was supposed to cover a birthmark on my forehead. Its easy to apply but it doesn't cover it and leaves the area looking worse, like i got a burn scar. feeling a bit let down, as i have to use a concealer to cover the area, and then create layers, too much work for a guy.",1.0
"2 1/2 weeks after my surgery I still have heavy bruising under my eyes.  To get this to cover you have to CAKE it on.  Then it looks obvious and just like a big clumpy mess.. I had always heard the rave reviews about Dermablend.. But I can't give it one, wish I could.",1.0

It was dry and cakey when I applied it...very difficulty to blend. I could tell immediately on the first application something was different. I want to say perhaps it was expired, an imitation, or on the shelves to long.  Disappointed as this is a very expensive product.  Would not purchase from this seller again as I am questioning the quality control.",1.0
Not the exact same color and claimed. Very disappointed because I order the same color from dermablend and it not what I gott this time.,1.0
"So sad that this didn't work for me. I have oily skin and this product didn't stay on at all. Any time I touched my face it completely came off. I scratched the side of my nose and I had absolutely no makeup there. I have very red splotches on my face and hoped this was the product to cover it. Instead it just showed up more where the makeup came off. By the time I was ready to leave work the makeup was so bad I look like my face was scared (kind of like a burn victim) and very wrinkly. I have very few wrinkles under my eyes, but nothing like this! It also made my pores look huge! I'm glad this works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too.",1.0

It is thick and yeah it may fill in those acne scares but it looks so caked on. Not only is it caked on but you can feel it sitting on your skin. I attempted to apply several layers and even bought the setting powder with it and did as instructed and it looked so awful, I was wondering if it came with a red squeaky nose too.

I don't like the product that was sent to be because it wasn't mineral powder but liquid foundation that I received. The mineral is more suitable for my skin than liquid bc I usually use the mineral as a finishing powder. The liquid foundation is watery and not thick enough for my liking even with using it alone. I've been a fan of the mineral powder ever since two yrs ago. I didn't want to send it back due to expense with shipment.,1.0
This product is a total fake. I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right.

This is not the real deal and I'm sad that this exists. I will never order from this seller again.,1.0
"I am a certified Jane Iredale makeup artist, and this isn't Jane Iredale foundation. It is in the correct packaging but the foundation has been switched out.  I ordered this hoping to find my favorite and the only makeup that doesn't irritate my skin at a discounted price, however when I received my order I put it on and the first thing I noticed was the scent. Jane makeup does have a smell, as all makeup does, but it has no fragrance and this most definitely had fragrance,  I could also smell the talc (it has a very distinct smell and if you know it, you can spot it in any makeup) which Jane NEVER puts in their products. My face then proceeded to rash and itch and I knew for sure something was up. I later bought an amazing base from an accredited Jane Iredale vendor and compared the two, there is a noticeable difference in color, texture, and smell. This is not the real deal, if you purchase this you are undoubtedly getting scammed by fake Jane Iredale, normally I wouldn't believe a review like this, but know that I am certified with jane and am a master aesthatician, I know my makeup and skin care.

"I was so thankful to come across this dvd. For some reason during the Christmas season they never show this movie on any of the numerous cable stations anyore. I haven't seen this movie on tv since the 1980's and I don't understand why, it is such a good movie and Henry Winkler's performance is terrific. I believe Happy Days was still on tv at this time albiet it was probably during the end of the series. The only place to find this movie was through Amazon just as they don't play it on tv you can't find the dvd in the stores either so the ability to find this movie was almost impossible except thankfully through Amazon. I would never pay as much for a dvd as I did for this one but it is one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies so it had a special meaning to surprise him with this as a gift, so thank you.",5.0

I enjoyed this TV production the first time I saw it in 1979 or 1980 and really enjoyed it this time.  It is obvious that it is a TV production but most of the acting is good and the story set in the depression is good.  I am very happy it was still available.,5.0

"I worked for an ABC station in the 70's and early 80's so I knew and watched when this movie first aired.  I wasn't expecting a great show, just one of those expositions of ABC stars like ""Love American Style"" was in that error.  I was very surprised and my wife even cried.  This is a well written, well directed and edited movie.  Not corny but as the title denotes, with a script that moves away from the original script.  In this era of NAFTA and trade treaties this message is as timely as it was in the period of the movie.  Also Henry Winkler, who obviously plays the character in several ages, does a great job.",5.0

"I last watched this movie sometime back in the 80's when it used to be on regularly around Christmas time on TV. I loved this movie as it was an interesting and engaging alternative to the more common Scott and Finney versions of the classic Christmas Carol that always got the most airtime. It depicts depression era New England with a cold, grey feeling that really comes across the screen without bogging the movie down and having grown up in Boston, it makes it that much more intersting to me. The acting is top-notch, particularly from Henry Winkler. It was always one of my favorite Christmas specials. Then it went off the air never to return sometime back then (80's, 90's, I'm not sure exactly when) and I never forgot about it and often pined to watch it again but somehow always seemed to forget to look for it on VHS, DVD, or online. I stumbled onto it on Amazon via my Roku box and was delighted to see it again and purchased it so I can once again enjoy this teriffic movie with my kids! Any fan of A Christmas Carol (or just really good Christmas movies) should immediately get this movie in their collection!",5.0
"This is an excellent movie.  I had not seen it for many years.  It used to be on television every Christmas, but not in the last several years.  I checked Amazon and there it was.

"Henry Winkler did a wonderful acting job as Benedict Slade. I first saw this movie online recently and wonder how I missed never seeing it on TV. And not just his acting but it seemed all actors did a great job in this American version of Scrooge. After seeing it online I ordered it right away to add to our Christmas collection. If you haven't seen it I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy other adaptations of Scrooge you will certainly enjoy this movie.

"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur ""The Fonz"" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.",5.0

"""An American Christmas Carol"" is a quintessential version of Dickens' classic tale set during the depression.  I view it every year.

"This version of Dickens classic tale was a made for tv special in 1979. I first saw it when I was a kid and have watched it every year since. Henry Winkler does a great job as Benidict Slade, a Scrooge like charecter who needs to find the meaning of giving again. Sure the make up and some of the dialogue are dated, but the true meaning of the story shines through. If you have never seen this classic then try it out.",5.0

"How coincidental that this program, aired by ABC in 1979, is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later, in 2009, experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character, Benedict Slade, really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production.",5.0

"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of ""A Christmas Carol.""

Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.

His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.

It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.

David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past.",5.0
"The Christmas Carol is my all-time favorite movie, and I had ever version imagionable on VHS, including this adaptation, but the remarkably enhanced quality of the DVD version is extremely enjoyable to watch.

"93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.
-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.
-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.

""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""
""Thank God,"" Slade responds.
""It's worse,"" Latham says.

A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""
""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""

A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.
-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.
-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.
-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.
""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""
""Humbug?""",5.0
This is an excellent remake of the Dickins' A Christmas Carol.  It should be placed along side your existing Christmas collection!,5.0
"We'd taped this from TV years ago and I was delighted to find this version on Amazon.  Winkler is fantastic as the Scrooge character.  While the story-line has been modified to be early 20th century New England the elements of the original Dickens story are preserved in this version.  I'm a ""Christmas Carol"" fanatic and this is a super addition to my collection.  Buy it- you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"""Scrooge"" will never be seen the same after you watch Henry Winkler perform!
  He brings depth to his character and makes this story more than merely an old miser waking up to the wretched reality of his existence.  ""Mr. Slade"" becomes someone we can understand, someone whose ambitions become a source of tragedy in his life; it was never his intention to become such a cold-hearted skinflint -- he simply allowed his thirst for ""success"" to blind his view.
  For anyone who appreciates art in its purest form, this movie is a must!!",5.0
"A friend put me on to this a few years back when he asked me to find it for him on DVD.  A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three ""ghosts"" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the ""romantic"" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.  Overall, a worthy addition to your collection of Christmas Carol movies.  Also, kudos to Image entertainment for re-releasing this at a reasonable price and getting rid of the dreaded snap-case.",5.0
"I have been looking for this particular video for some time (video stores and garage sales) It is not shown on regular t.v. any more and I was thrilled to see if for sale.  I would have paid what ever ther person wanted, but it turns out that I paid a very small fee and made my husband very happy.  The only thing I could say that was misleading was the mail time - when purchasing this I was told it would be at my door on December 17th and I did not receive it until December 22nd.  I try to understand it was the ""season"" but when it was shipped on the 14th it is very hard to see why when I live in a very populated city (tampa bay area)",5.0

"This is far and away my favorite serious (i.e., not Scrooged) version of A Christmas Carol.  Pre-redemption Benedict Slade is simultaneously worse than Ebeneezer Scrooge, and more believable.  Scrooge is merely cheap, while Slade is actively harming his community, including the very orphanage where he grew up.  Meanwhile, his poor origins make his lifelong aquisitiveness easy to believe.  After the ghosts come, his earlier repossesions allow for a longer and more fun sequence of surprising everyone else with his new self.",5.0
"If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.

"This version of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of the best.

Henry Winkler is brillant as Benedict Slade and in my opinion this is his most outstanding performance. I watched this movie when it was first released on TV during his Fonzie heyday, and I never once saw that 50's character. He is immersed in his character and is a completely convincing ""Scrooge.""

I'm disappointed that this isn't shown on TV, and I have purchased it so I can enjoy it again and again along with my husband and little girl.

My top three ""A Christmas Carol"" versions star ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alistair Sim, ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney, and ""An American Christmas Carol"" with Henry Winkler. I won't bother with the others.",5.0
"My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.

"Bonjour!
Je crois que de toutes les versions qui ont t faites du conte de Charles Dickens, celle-ci est sans doute  la fois la plus originale et la plus fidle.  Le thme central est bien respect mais l'adaptation est totale puisqu'elle situe l'action en Amrique plutt que dans l'Angleterre du 19e sicle mais avec une touche dbut du sicle et moderne.
Mme si ce film n'est disponible qu'en anglais sur DVD, il vaut la peine d'tre achet puisqu'il n'est plus diffus  la tlvision depuis plusieurs annes suite  une msentente avec le producteur et il semble bien que la situation n'est pas prs de changer.  C'est un film de collection que tous se doivent de possder pour le temps de Nol.  Une version franaise a jadis t disponible mais elle ne l'est plus maintenant ce qui est trs malheureux.  Henry Winkler est remarquable.",5.0
"Like many other reviewers, I first saw this as a kid on television in '79 and Henry Winkler's ""Fonzie"" persona was still so much a part of the cultural fabric that it was somewhat shocking to even think of him, much less see him, as anything else.
However, I was transfixed by this adaptation on the Dickens story and was genuinely moved by Winkler's ( Benedict Slade ) transformation at the end. Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the ""Cratchit"" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too ""soft"".
The actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.
The movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.
My only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (""Scrooge"") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out. This is noticeable particularly against the distinctive New England accents employed throughout the rest of the picture.
I recommend this DVD highly for anyone who loves the Christmas season, the Dickens novel in particular, Henry Winkler, or just any good heartwarming story. I looked for this on DVD and/or VHS for almost twenty years. It was worth the wait.",5.0
"""A Christmas Carol"" may well be the most-adapted Christmas story in literature, with version ranging from whimsical to musical to deadly serious.  This particular version, starring Henry Winkler as Benedict Slade (a.k.a. Scrooge) is my favorite.
The movie translates Dickens' classic story from 19th century England to Depression-era New England.  The result is very effective.  For me, an American born to parents who grew up in the Depression, the 20th century setting made the story feel very real.  The writers and director made excellent decisions in their choice of sets.  Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (""You must be Future,"" Slade declares, cowering before him).
Winkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.
""An American Christmas Carol"" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular ""Happy Days"" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection.",5.0
"First time i saw this movie was 1985 on television. Henry Winkler was excellent! Actually, the whole cast was great. I spent 17 years trying to locate this movie.

"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END",5.0

This tells the story of the Biblical character Joseph, from his days as a young shepherd, to being sold by his brothers into slavery in Egypt, to becoming the second-most-powerful man in Egypt and an eventual reunion with his family.  It's a well done production that brings the story to life.",5.0

One of the best Christian movies I have ever seen.  Long but very impressionable.  It builds faith.,5.0
"One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.
You can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available.",5.0

"The 1977 theatrical version of this film was truly great.  It was a breakthrough. I hated the rerelease the so called ""special edition"".  It was the first time that I had ever heard of a director taking a magnificent film and then ruining it.  When VHS came out I hoped the far superior original '77 version of the film would become available but they only offered that aweful ""SE"" version.  Now the DVD is out and again Speilberg has blown it.  At least he has finally admitted that showing the inside of the mothership was a big mistake.  STill, he seemed to think the rest of his changes were worth making.  In my view everything they ended up doing weakened a once great film.  Now I hate that film.  It sucks.  I understand the only way to view the great origional '77 version is on laser disk which are probably very hard to find.  Screwing around with the original '77 version was the greatest mistake I'd ever seen a professional filmmaker make.  Allowing the origional to disappear the next.",1.0

"There's nothing wrong with this movie, if you like a bunch of bad tasted sequences, terrible acting, bad horror, this is the movie for you.",1.0
"What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg, the insipid director who brought us such films as ""Always"" or ""Hook"", other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane? This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid.",1.0

THis is a dishonest ""horror"" movie, taking some bad teen actors, adding some badly produced gore, making funnyless jokes all around ... Everyhting failed miserably here ( and I like to watch ridiculous horror movies, like ""SCREAMS"", ""NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"",etc, just for the sake of laughing ). But this one is so bad, I almost ejected the tape from my VCR in the middle of it. A shame that actor so young accept to shoot this kind of garbage.",1.0
"Having heard a lot about this movie, after seeing it, I utterly fail to understand what people like about it. The story: guy has a hell of a row with his wife, leaves her and his nice kids, travels the country with another wife, and finally leaves the mess around him in a spaceship. If this is what happens when aliens come down, well, let them please stay where they belong.",1.0
"I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I loved it when I was a kid, but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres, I just wasn't impressed at all. I saw the DVD and couldn't resist, but I wish I would have. This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion, but this is pathetic. At least Jaws and E.T. have some action throughout the entire movie. Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning, 1.25 hours of boredom, and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid. My kids couldn't stand it, so it's obviously not a timeless classic, like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s.",1.0
"THis movie is ridiculous. Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid. This could be a ""trash"" or ""B"" movie great picture, but everyone involved (teen actors, director, etc) are uninspired. This was a shame to the horror genre, which already is full of prejudices against it.",1.0
"Every remotely funny line in this movie (promoted as a comedic horror movie) was shown in the preview. If you like alternative horror movies, this may be for you, but I thought the plot was weak, the dialogue  contrived and the movie generally awful. The only redeeming qualities of  this movie were the acting skills of Seth Green and Rodman Flender. Know  what you are getting into with this ""B"" movie for the nineties.",1.0
"This movie is only for people who think teenagers smoking weed is funny. This movie didn't provide any laughs or gore, and it was nothing but an Evil Dead 2 ripoff. The story was one of the most pathetic I have seen in a  long time, and it resembled something of a late-night B Movie. In fact,  I've seen B movies with a better plot than this. Evil Dead 2 was 10 times  funnier in it's 20 minute possessed hand sequence, and a lot more original.  And the ending??? could they have come up with anything worse??? the chick  is tied up on to a car that is going to flatliner here on the ceiling,  which has a pentagram painted on it??? give me a break. but, like I said,  when you have guys like Seth Green smoking weed in a movie, it's sure to be  a winner with a lot of brainless teenagers who don't know what a real  horror movie is. or a comedy for that matter.",1.0

"'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long.",1.0
I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.,1.0
"I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as ""Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC"" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it.",1.0
"Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. All of the acting talent in this film is wasted in support of a lazy, hackneyed screenplay that cheats its audience emotionally. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe.",1.0
"Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip.",1.0
"Let's get one thing straight, I HATE this movie, I will make no attempt to give an un-biased review here. This movie deserves nothing more.
Where to start? Well firstly, It features the super hag, Julia Roberts, and as if this wasn't enough, Susan Sarandon is in it aswell.
Now if you haven't fainted at the sheer horror of that concept, you will when you realise the dullness of it's plot. Super hag doesn't get on with her boyfriends ex wife, then the ex-wife dies, the end. BORING.
After sitting through this painfully bad movie, I had to take a shower to get the stench of bad movie off me. I then had to watch some ninja movies to forget my terrifiying ordeal.
This movie was lacking (and went I say lacking, I mean totally viod of)in the most essential aspect of a movie, a** kicking. This movie could've been so much more entertaining if it had robots or pirates.
Please do not buy this movie, It's possibly the worse movie ever made.",1.0
"Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)
It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.
There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)
Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck. (zero)",1.0
"I hated this movie.  I lived the ""stepmom"" role.  I currently the ""ex"" and my son has to deal with his ""stepmom"".  Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.  Pass on this movie...unless you are looking for the fantasy of how to deal with a family that is not yours.  Also see the Brady Bunch....",1.0
"I have been wanting to view this movie for quite some time. What a disappointment! The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research. It would have done them wonders to log on to any number of newsgroups to get a feel for what real step families go through. The characters in this movie weren't real. I was very disappointed.
The rest of the movie was bland, boring, and frankly, unbelievable. I mean, what mother can afford to take a child out on a twilight horse ride on a moments notice? And where, pray tell, is this fantastic New York suburb Sarandon lived in that afforded her pastoral views of mountains and woods? Did anyone miss the fact the Roberts worked in NYC and was mysteriously able to pick-up the stepkids at their birthday parties and schools in this lush suburb? Sorry, I grew up in that area of the East Coast and I'm still guessing where this suburb is.
Find something better to do with 2 hours. If your really want to watch an excellent movie about the horrors and nuances of divorce see 1982's ""Shoot The Moon"" with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. Now that was a good movie.",1.0
"This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Not that the plot is that boring or the music not entertaining. But it is indicative of Hollywood's limits - having Roberts, Sarandon and Harris (thank God he's in here)  together is by no means a guarantee for a good movie. Everything sounds  fake, the acting is really poor, especially Julia Roberts' - but this isn't  new (see the last scene, for example). Let's forget this movie, there are  thousands of others waiting to be seen.",1.0

"Michelle Pfeiffer fails to convince me of her grief at losing her son to a kidnapper. She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.",1.0

"I must say, after watching this movie, I was looking forward to reading  some hilarious amazon reviews that would rip it to shreds....however, it  seems that most of the reviews were written by people that liked this  movie.  All in all, it was AWFUL!  The actors, some of whom did a fair job,  suffered from the terrible script.  Who wrote this movie anyway?  Most of  the dialogue was so unbelievably generic that it could have been written by  fifth graders.  I'm not really sure why Michelle Pfeiffer would waste her  time with this movie.  Unfortunately, she had to look as sad and vulnerable  as possible in nearly EVERY scene--this became OLD FAST.  Whoopie Goldberg  as an agent of the law?  Treat Williams, not a bad actor, also suffered  from his horrid lines.  I kept waiting for him to begin chasing Michelle  around the house with a butcher's knife yelling how it was really him that  planned the whole thing.  Then there's the oldest kid--all he does is WHINE  his dialogue throughout the movie.  And then there's Sam, the kid that was  lost for so many years...he looked as though he was quietly plotting the  demise of his biological family and just waiting for the right moment to  kill them all.  About the only role that didn't suck was the little girl,  who mysteriously disappears half way through the movie, never to be heard  from again.  And then there's the costumes and scenery.  I know this is  supposed to be suburban chicago, and I love movies set in Chicago, but the  wardrobe people apparently decided to dress everyone in the most cliched  suburban way possible, actually they look like they're modeling the new  fall wardrobe for some department store, and scenery....well you'll see  what I mean.  I haven't read the book, I must say, by the end of the movie,  it seems like the writers either forgot what they were writing about, or  the production ran out of money and had to end the movie the way it was.  Remarkably, the longest any dramatic tension is sustained is for about two  seconds, and any emotional interest in the characters is completely  non-existent by the end of the movie.  The chain of events throughout the  movie is nonsensical and ridiculous.  All in my opinion, of course.",1.0

I don't hate this movie title but I hate the company who produce it. It is Mill Creek Entertainment. They almost removed all of the closed-captioning or English Subtitling features on DVD. I do not understand why the original DVDs companies have it and sell off to Mill Creek Entertainment by reducing some of the important features. Even they don't add booklet inside (chapters/information). Whole thing is sucks! Try purchase original DVD of this title from Columbia/Tristar DVD if available out there.,1.0

"I've only walked out on 5 movies in an actual theater: Born in East L.A., Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Valentine and The Last Action Hero... Even though I've not changed my opinions about the former films, I thought I'd give LAH one more try.... I was unfortunate enough to find a DVD copy in the horrid & worthless pan & scan format.. albeit, it was only $1... Turned it off after 2 minutes in.. You know, had this been a 1.85:1 film & it was ""full Screen"", I could have worked with that and adjusted my HDTV to make it 1.85:1, but this is not the case with this film & most of the DVD's that Sony now releases in the 1.33 ratio...

The fact that any company this late in the home entertainment game would release a 2.35:1 film in a lousy 1:33 ratio is not only insulting and reckless, it shows incompetent individuals are making key decisions at the studios and they deserve to lose money.. This is yet another DVD from Sony which is worthless, and anyone who cares about movies and this film should avoid this version..... Oh, and I finally found an original '97 DVD release of LAH when released in both P&S & Widescreen on the same disc.. Got it for another $1, & yup, after all of these years, it still sucks... even for just $1.",1.0

"This movie is the epitome of excess: budget, explosions, melodrama, ""cuteness"", in-jokes.  LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, "" That skit was pretty cool, huh?"".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.
The only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble.
I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.  Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said, ""Magic ticket, my a**!"".  My sentiments exactly.",1.0

"I am one of the few who still has a VCR player and a dwindling library of VHS tapes. My prized tape was the Muppet's family Christmas. A few weeks ago . . . right after Christmas I wanted to watch it as I do almost every year or every other year. I popped it into my VCR and couldn't wait to hear the Muppet's preform ""It's a lovely weather for a slay ride together with you. ""  While driving to the home of Fozzy's mother. As all VHS tapes are bound to do,the tape broke ! :( :( I was soo heart broken. Now after new years and to give myself a present or two I didn't get during the season I came with a list that Santa didn't fill hoping to cross off a couple of my list. I saw that AMAZON had it and I was very excited. Till I read the comments. Than I was heart broken again! I would rather have not have any of it than a small part of it. I Wish I knew someone who had a tape of it I could borrow! I would be glad to have to fast forward though the commercials. As much as I love the show. It's the end seeing Jim Henson smiling and talking to sprocket that was my favorite part. He died a year or two after it premiered. Or at least I think that he died that year or sometime in the two years after. I remember wanting to watch it that December after he died. I watched the whole show happy to watch it on air with the commercials and they edited him out. It was very sad that he died so young.",1.0

"Yep, like just about everyone else here, I was extremely frustrated by the edited portions that were left out of this DVD. The cuts happen in what seem to be arbitrary places, and would probably be very confusing to someone who hasn't seen it before. E.g., the part where Fozzie and the snowman do their number together was completely cut, but not the later parts where he's trying to show Kermit his new act. Also, the part where Miss Piggy slips and falls on the icy patch was completely cut out, which was supposed to be the big pay-off of that whole running gag. I would never have bought this DVD if I had known ahead of time that I'd only be getting 2/3rds of the special I loved from TV. Not sure why they'd even bother putting this to DVD in the first place, honestly, unless they were just trying to get suckers like me to fork over the cash without being completely upfront about the product they're selling.

If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.

"My sister and I have been watching this special together since I was in sixth grade. I am now 25. Two years ago I purchased the VHS version, as our old version taped from the TV has some serious sound problems to the point of being unwatchable. I was *sick* with disappointment when I found that some of my favorite scenes, including the charming ""Muppet Babies"" scene, had been cut out.
Yesterday my sister told my that ""A Muppet Family Christmas"" had been released on DVD. I was thrilled, and immediately rushed out, looking for reviews of it. Imagine my frustration when I found that the DVD contained the cut version as well!
I think this is ridiculous.... and so should you! I really, truly, fail to understand Columbia-Tristar's logic. The total scenes cut were only about 10 minutes, but when you consider that the original show was only 50 minutes, you realize that they have cut out *20%* of the movie! With DVDs that can easily hold over three hours of movie time and are cheaper to produce than their VHS counterparts, how does Columbia-Tristar justify cutting out ten minutes of this classic? I could see paying... for a remastered, uncut edition of ""AMFC""...heck, I'd be willing to pay a lot more than that. But until they release it in its intact form, Columbia-Tristar won't be seeing a dime of my money...and I would advise you not to waste yours on this disappointing (DVD).

"Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles, holy jesus it's awful. You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.

Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. ""Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!"".

Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.

So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, ""oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond"" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.

So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.

Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.

So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience ""hey I'm still here"", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS!

"Trash and an unnecessary sequel.

So many holes in this story it makes no sense. First of all if Karla is Julie's best friend and sees how much Julie likes Ray why is she trying to hook her up with someone else. She's not trying to help her alleged best friend and comfort her just go and sleep with someone else. Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on

To make this movie even more ridiculous, Karla the genius says Rio as the capital of Brazil and for those who know geography very well know right off the bat that this was a set up. Bill Cobbs' character knew that it was the wrong answer but yet didn't say anything to warn the four people that Rio was the wrong answer and help them try to go back home, waits until the last minute for the body count to pile up.

Ben Willis have so many opportunities to kill Julie when she's at the club, in the bathroom, in the tanning bed and don't do anything plus he could have killed Ray after he fell but didn't do anything there either. So this killer is a complete moron but the victims are even dumber when some of them were armed with weapons ( a knife, axe, baseball bat mind you) they completely forget they had these weapons and don't make it a possible 3 on 1 attack and just run. Don't even try to work together to kill this man. I guess if you have common sense horror movies won't exist.

Horrendous, exceedingly poor inception, timing, predictable, not fun, not scary, not suspensful, lacked character development, irritating and nauseating tension, if any; grade school level acting responses to often life threatening situations, freddie prinz jr is enough to make this film a one star from jumpstreet, jennifer hewiit is cute...cute, not talented, cute.

The whole film is a basis of a makover of Scream which just goes to show, that anyone...ANYONE...can be famous...that is food for thought for all your theatre majors and film students.

Save your money, and save your precious time, avoid this film. ""Uh, duh, uh duh,"" that is how one feels after viewing this atrocity; this mindless banter of redundant B film acting.

PATHETIC. I still don't know why I watched this. I still don't know why I'm reviewing this.",1.0
"Director:  Danny Cannon

Cast:  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson, Bill Cobbs, Mathew Settle, Jeffrey Combs, Jennifer Esposito.

Running Time:  100 minutes

Rated R for intense terror violence and gore, strong language and some drug use.

It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but, thanks to the canny direction and score, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a very effective thriller. Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.

You can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated ""Judge Dredd"" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. ""I Still Know..."" fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying ""shocker"" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years. Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream, a la the ""surprise"" ending of the first ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""...I guess we'll find out if and when ""I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago"" is made.",1.0
"Please if you think this is good horor then you don't know what good horror is, this movie along with the first one and even all of the Scream movies are garbage any real fan of cult horror or real horror will tell you don't wste your money. Real horror is made from the start of the first night of the living dead 1968 till about late 80's then from there horror quit is not wat it use to be.  "" I know what you did last summer "" is not good AT ALL",1.0
"I can understand why a sequel was made to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.
The sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).
Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go ""Ohhhhh!!""?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!
Another problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.
One more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?
Viewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).
Chalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of ""Scream.""  While ""Scream"" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.",1.0
"If you couldn't get enough of attractive well-known actresses from this month's hot TV show being casted in moronic horror movies with no love for the genre whatsoever then I've got good news. Another ""I Know What You Did"" film. The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy.
A year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort. Little do they know that it has all been set-up by the killer from the original and he is looking for a little more retribution. A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids.
Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why ""her people can't dance"". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain. As mediocre and tired as I found the first film, the script for ""part two"" manages to show it up in every way except the good kind.",1.0
"I Still Know...is as absurd as they come. Four teens, who are sharing a brain, win a trip to the Bahamas. They arrive to learn that they have arrived at the end of season, which is the 4th of July. Forget the fact that they don't celebrate the 4th of July there. This is a neat way of reducing the cast size. Later, there is a supposed hurricane, but the production company wouldn't put out for more than one rain machine, so it's pretty dinky. It does make a fine mess of Hewitt's hairdo, which was bad before it got wet.
The fisherman they thought they killed in the first movie is back, and boy! is he upset! The kids waste a lot of time chasing the wrong killer. One of the hotel employees practices voodoo, so he's got to be it, right? No, this is the Caribbean, not Omaha.
I lost track of the body count because the person I watched this one with couldn't keep a straight face. When I said I was doing my job, they really fell apart.
This is that new breed of movie in which no one knows how to write the music. Here, there is scary music every time someone turns their back to the camera. HD20 had the same problem. These little movies used to have some interesting music, as well as some swell camera angles. Now they've all turned into MTV marathons.",1.0
"'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' really does milk the slasher formula.  It's a follow-up to the pretty good 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but the first movie already killed off the only two members of the cast that could act.  The title is also all wrong - shouldn't it be the summer before last?
The story involves Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her new best friend (Brandy) win a trip to the Caribbean.  So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.  The fact that's it's storm season leads to a lot of obvious plots involving people not being heard over the wind and a lot of thunder that is probably supposed to rack up tension.  There is absolutely nothing tense about this movie.  The usual round of killings ensue with a man stalking through the hotel, which is inexplicably almost empty save for a few signposted red herrings.
Whilst the first movie had a tongue-in-cheek yet still fairly creepy script by Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame, this has no hallmarks whatsoever.  Apart from Brandy, who manages to ground the rest of the cast, the acting is dismal.  It says it all when the audience looks forward to the arrival of Freddy Prinze Junior.  The ending is laughable and there isn't a scare in sight.  This isn't just one of the worst sequels ever made but one of the worst movies too.",1.0
"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.
The movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too.
Anyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. ""This is our version of winter,"" says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously.
The movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, ""This is such a good film,"" because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot.
Nothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here?
And what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.
I had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress.
In watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""People are actually going to like this."" Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those ""in-crowd"" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.",1.0
"Even if you watch this as a comedy, you'll feel bad. You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this  lousy sequel. Jennifer is amazingly pretty, is the only point worthwhile  watching. The end was a bad joke. If they are trying to turn the killer  Will into another Jason, Freddy or Myers, it won't suceed.",1.0
"I can't believe a sequel was made. It's not like IKWYDLS was original or that anyone ASKED for a sequel. The idea of sequels isn't a bad idea. If the sequel improves on the original or develops the characters more it is a  very good idea. But ISKWYDLS was ONLY made to make money from the naive  audiences who saw the first.

Well we were very much robbed. This film is  worse than the first. Nothing surprising happens. It is a VERY badly  written film, I kid you not. This is not the films worst quality. The  acting, photography, lighting, direction, music and editing are terrible.  Even the title is too long and stupid. I STILL KNOW would have been a much  better title.

Like many of it's predecessors, in the late 90s and early  80s, we have close-ups of the actors who are suddenly surprised by their  friends from behind while being suspicious that someone is at that moment  watching them. While this happens a burst of very, very loud music tries to  enhance the ""effect"" of the ""scare"". The other clich it doesn't bother to  not use is the one where we think that ""The killer"" is watching them from a  closet or something and then we realize it's just cat or banging window in  the wind. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN (during a moment of false security) THE  KILLER APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE. Puh-lease. Give us a little credit.",1.0

Ok, any  red blooded male can dig Jennifer Love Hewitt - but only a thirteen year  old could ever be satisfied by a popcorn slasher movie with low gore  quotient and no NAKED LADIES!!!  Come on guys - can you image these  production line pop singers even gettin' it on??!!??

"Just read the review posted by ""century19@worldnet.att.net"" below.  He hits it perfectly.
There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.
Easily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then.

"This movie was recommended to me and I had heard that it was classic and like De Niro as an actor along with Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel.  If you were to edit the useless scenes out of this movie it'd be about 30 min.  Foster is billed as a main character but has one scene in the first hour.  Shepherd's character serves no purpose outside of showing that De Niro's character has issues, which you should be able to figure out fairly easy without her character.

Having not been alive when this movie came I'm not going to try to understand the time because I simply can't but this movie is so utterly boring that it almost puts you to sleep.

All that says that is one particular clip in a liquor store where this stupid black bank robber comes in and uses the GD word while trying to steal money from the clerk. Hearing the GD word come out of this pile of steaming trash made me so infuriated that I wante to scream so loud that it would kill me. USING THE 'GD' WORD IN A MOVIE IS INEXCUSABLE REPULSIVE!!!! Every time it is used, it is always by some useless nobody actor who let's this word just fly right out of his diarrhea toilet bowl scented mouth. I don't mind the fact that he is cursing, but using the GD word, or anything else that takes God's or Jesus's name in vein is incredibly wrong. I'm glad this nobody was killed in this scene, because he he deserved to die and suffer for eternity.

Do not watch this movie, or any movie with cursing where nobody actors use the GD word while trying to get their point out while using swear words. Watch movies that are innovative where the usage of this word is easy to ignore.

"I was only 12-years-old when I saw Iron Eagle with my dad, who passed away 5 years ago, and it's one of the finest memories I'll ever have.

For people who moan and groan about movies all the time for not being plausible, especially movie critics, I say ""just grow up!"" Movies are supposed to be about entertainment. Leave it to the movies based on true stories to be the so-called plausible ones.

The reason I gave this review a 1-star rating is not because of the movie itself, but because of the horrible DVD. It's the only one available as far as I know here in the U.S. It's in ""full screen"" format, which means edited for old televisions and not in its original widescreen format. That, of course, means a lot of the picture is cut off. The so-called 5.1 surround sound is just as bad, with little detectable sound from separate audio channels. It's old, outdated, and is in serious need of a brand new DVD and hopefully Blu-Ray version sometime soon.",1.0
"I checked the ... DVD special list to see what refuse the movie studios are trying to unload.
My suspicions were affirmed with the listing of this title -- Iron Eagle.  ... How many of us were inspired to eventually pilot a tie-fighter or x-wing after watching Star Wars?  And, anyone removed from the experience of working in the REAL U.S. Air Force can forgive the gross oversight and disregard for detail that this film shames upon the U.S. armed forces.  We all must overlook the details in most movies.
However, this inane and unplausible plot is not saved by the thrill of a boy hopping in a slick military plane and the ensuing ""save the world"" 8-year-old fantasy.  The storyline would make much more sense if the hero/child Doug Masters actually were a 5-year-old boy who wandered away from his nanny and happened upon an Air Force jet.  Then, the film could be enjoyed for its ridiculousness.
The memory of seeing repeated glimpses of this movie repeated on HBO 18 years ago reminds me of how well this film captured the ""Worst Movie Ever"" in my book.  There are worse movies out there, but this one is insidiously hyped up enough to make a fool out of you too to ever actually watch it.",1.0
Read that this movie was a classic and worthy to be rented & watched.  What a joke!  It was miserable just trying to get through.,1.0
Movie kept cutting out and finally shut down with 10 minutes left which we never did see,1.0
"The movie was all in Spanish!  I only speak English, so it was CRAP",1.0
"Bad quality, did not enjoy",1.0
"Movies like this are a disgusting tribute to the filth and perversion that seems to be prevalent in our major cities.  I wish I could ""unsee"" it.",1.0

Thought it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Stupid Stupid Stupid,1.0
"I rarely feel like walking out of a movie, but I did with this.  I was watching the DVD and thought about stopping it but instead just let it play while I went about other business.

This movie has no point to it.  it is weird oddball humor for no other reason or purpose other than weird oddball humor.  And I use the term ""humor"" very loosely.

It's obviously not supposed to be a real-life story; it's too strange.  It can't be a satire; there's no parallel to anything in real life.  It's not much of a comedy; the story is weird without being funny.  So what is it?  Nothing.  It's just a bunch of strange characters doing strange things for strange reasons, that has no emotional heft.  You don't care about the characters because they are all caricatures.  You don't feel any emotion because the plot is just absurd.  You don't laugh at any ""jokes"" because they aren't jokes, they're just people acting oddly.  There is nothing to enjoy in this movie.  It seems to be an exercise in deliberately being as weird as possible just for the sake of being weird.  But I see no purpose or artistic point to it.  Maybe we're supposed to be challenged in our assumptions of narrative, coherent story, interesting characters?  For what?  The whole thing is pointless and a waste of time.

I felt the same way about The Royal Tenenbaums.  But I want to be fair and say I did like Rushmore, which was odd but had more of a believable plot and characters.  I am sure nothing and nobody like that exists in real life, but at least it was within the realm of realism.  At least enough within it to prevent me from rolling my eyes at the absurdity of it.",1.0

Dreary movie and disjointed. Can't believe it was nominated for best picture!,1.0
"This is a classic example of self-important Hollywood congratulating itself. Don't be swayed by the pseudo-intellectual thumbs up garbage.
De Niro's acting is phenomenal, but the story line, character development,( Jodi Foster gets top billing in the credits right after Di Nero, but does not really appear in the film well into it's second half,  the over the top music,( just listen to the score after everybody is dead, about 10 minuets before the end ). What is up with that? Most great directors make one or two horrible movies. This is Marty's absolute worst. Don't waste your time.",1.0

"I absolutely love Wes Anderson. He is, without a doubt, one of my favorite directors (and, who doesn't like the Wilson brothers?) Since it was Anderson's first film, I was expecting a ""rough around the edges, super quirky, but heartfelt"" story. Not so. I was shocked that his movie did nothing for me. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait for it to end. My recommendation - don't waste your time.",1.0

"What did they do to TAXI DRIVER? I was excited to order the 4K version. I immediately put it on my 4K Blu Ray player to watch on my new 70 inch 4K TV.  What a waste of time and money. I don't know what mastered copy of the film they used for this version, but it's a total bust.

"All the movies of Mel Brooks you'd want but I can't get any of them to play in 3 different DVD players. I bought back in October, gave to my son to put in our Ice Castle fish house for us to view or him and his buddies. He told me at the end of December, after a fishing trip,  that he couldn't  get the DVD's to play in Ice Castle. Finally got them back to me and I tried 2 more players and NOTHING. Now what do I do with the set?  They were a brand new, unopened set. Never ever thought I'd have to worry about a whole set being bad !!!!!!!!!!",1.0

My 7 year old son loved this case and all the pockets. It keeps his adventure bible protected and he loved the compass.,5.0
"Read reviews first! Med was WAY to big for a Cub Scout book, which is why I bought it and based on reviews. I don't know about the spiral versions because our troop gives them to us and they're not spiral. But the regular book, way too big. So I put the Adventure Bible hardback in it... Perfect fit (as description indicates). I will be trying the small for the scout book next.",5.0
"The PERFECT cover for a Boy Scout Handbook. Well made, and the pockets are nice to hold a spare pen (which Scouts typically forget on their uniform). We will see how it holds up, but it appears to be well made.

If you are buying this for the BSH, get the Medium size!",5.0
It was very hard to find a boys bible cover that fit my sons bible as it was either too big or too small. Odd sized bible I guess. This was perfect.,5.0
My son picked this out and I wouldn't be concerned about it travelling with him.  Very strong durable canvas cordura type material. No interior pockets.  Just pockets to slip in the front and back cover of bible with a pen holder.  My son puts in the back cover and leaves the front free so he can see his name and scripture he picked out on the front of his bible.  This leaves the slip pocket free for a notebook.  Very happy.,5.0
Worked perfectly for my Son's scouting manual that he must take with him to all scouting activities.  It works best with the three-ring binder version of the scouting book but I am using for the regular bound book and it's great.  Holds all his essentials nicely.,5.0
Fits the Boy Scout Handbook with ease inside with LOTS of room to spare.  My son has 2 individual merit badge books and the spiral bound merit badge master book in the front pouch.  Comments from everyone on what a great setup it is.,5.0
"I love this cover.  I keep my Bible in it which is bout 8 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches in it and it fits perfect.  The zipper zips smooth and the pockets are very handy as well.  The top pocket that has the compass on it spans the whole front cover.  As for the compass, though will point N. with a flick or two, I wouldn't rely on as my sole tool for geographic direction.",5.0
"Read a review that a medium size would fit a scout book.  It was true, a shade big, but my son is very happy with it.",5.0
"I got one of these for my son's boyscout handbook, and he loves it. I carries the book, as well as many other useful items and protects them. Shortly after he got his, I ordered 3 more, one for myself, another scout, and one for my mother for her tablet. She liked the fact that she could keep a couple stylus and the charger in the extra pockets and still have room for other items. Over all, a useful case that was built to handle whatever my 10 year old can throw at it.",5.0
"I bought a used study bible on ebay and got a great deal. I went searching for a decent cover for a reasonable price. I don't know how much a new one costs, but the used one works just fine. For what I paid for, I am very, very happy.

I took off the compass... well, because I don't need a compass on my bible cover. I love the pockets and the mesh compartment. The mesh compartment is especially useful for putting a pen and highlighter. Easy access. The larger pocket is perfect for a smaller notebook.

It's a great product. Please make sure you measure your bible or book and compare it to the measurement provided.",5.0
"This Bible cover is just right for a young (or older) man's Bible. It has pockets for what a boy needs to store, and the measurements were so accurate that it fit the Bible perfectly.",5.0
"This was a Christmas gift for a new Boy Scout and he loves it.  Has plenty room for manual, note pad and pencils.  The compass was a hit, too.",5.0
I bought this for my son to use with his Boy Scout book (with the spiral binding) and it fit perfectly! He loves the carry handle and the two little outside pockets. The flap on the outside provides an additional place for papers and notes. Very cool!,5.0
This bag fits my needs.  It has enough room inside for other literature as well as notepad and other small books.,5.0
"This is the perfect cover/organizer for my big, chunky, hardcover Bible. Now it's more attractive, easier to carry, and I have room for paper, pen, and more! No more juggling my Bible or losing papers out of it!

I'd recommend this to anyone. It's attractive, sturdy, and exactly what I'd hoped for.",5.0
"This is very roomy and durable so far. It has great function for everything you need to carry.  I can't say I have any complaints. It's bigger than I thought it would be, but definitely you get what you pay for. I was considering giving it as a gift, but I just couldn't give up. Just be sure to do the measurements so you know the size. I love the removable bible cover inside, that's very convenient and the strap inside is a little difficult, but it's not enough for me to give a bad review. I would highly recommend this product.",5.0
"Our Daughter is a volunteer minister, so we got this bag to hold her Bible (bookcover included) and Bible based literature. It also holds a pen, highlighter and a notepad - all of which are included. The ""leather"" on the bag seems easy to keep clean, but the light pink could show soil marks, easily. It is canvas. The handles seem sturdy. This bag has been used for a couple of weeks of daily use without problem. The zipper pulls have attached metal crosses, but other than that there are no emblems, idols, symbols or brands visible.",5.0
"It looks great, is the perfect size, and is sturdy without looking or feeling big and klunky. It comes with a highlighter which was a nice surprise, along with room for some accessories such as one of my devotional books. The internal sleeve holds my large print bible with no trouble. This is a great product and feels as if it will last for years.",5.0
"Oh, I love this case!!  I am involved in a couple of Bible studies and now I can carry all of my study materials in one bag!  It is handy when I stumble in the kitchen first thing in the morning to do my studies to have it already together!  There is a separate bible cover that is removable (for the times you only need a Bible).  It was a little big for my bible, but my bible is tiny and I easily resewed it.  There is also a removable should strap.  It comes with a pad of paper for notes and a yellow highlighter.  Love this cover.  Love it!  I have gotten so many compliments I am now looking to buy another for a friend who has been coveting it since she first saw it!  It definitely meets my needs.  It is more money than I would have normally spent, but I'm so glad I did!",5.0

It's nice and roomy so I can put my Sunday School book and notes in it without feeling that everything is crowded.  It even accommodates my iPad, but that makes it rather heavy.  There is a highlighter and pen included with another loop for a pencil/pen.  I'm using the small pocket on the outside to hold post-it notes, place markers, and extra leads for my multi-lead pencil.

"The photograph shows a pale olive green. I bought mine at a local store and the color is darker ( a rich medium olive). I prefer the darker look. I suspect that the flash may have washed out the picture posted here.
I love this cover. It is perfect for my needs. I carry a book light with my bible and there is a front pouch in this cover that it fits in perfectly (the flap at the top of the photo shows the entry to the pouch). The exterior feels like synthetic water resistant canvas - a nice weight. The interior is slick black nylon fabric like luggage liner. Visible black zipper. I feel that the cover is strong and I carry it by the handle.  Pen holders on the left and right interiors. I don't know if I will leave the compass attached - right now I find it rather amusing as it kind of captures the way I feel about my bible - first aid/marching orders/survival kit with a compass, for my heart.",5.0

"I got several of these for the Sunday School kids (ages 6-9) at our church to keep their new Bibles and marking sets in. They absolutely love them. We had someone embroider their names on the backs of them so they can tell them apart. These were a great find as they fit the rather oddly sized Bibles that came with our Sunday School Curriculum (about 9x7x2 inches). My brother also has had one in a smaller size and it has lasted him for over ten years, through Bible Camp, confirmation, and many other activities. The compasses seemed to work ok, but were not one of the main reasons we bought the covers.",5.0
"As a Army veteran and a Christian this is the perfect Bible cover for me. It works exactly is it that was designed to, all the pockets and netting work and seem to be sewn on well same with the zipper. It fits my MacArthur Study Bible a little bit snuggly but works all the same. Very good product in my opinion. God bless.",5.0

great. fits perfectly,5.0
"This bible carrying bag is most certainly well made. Its canvas material, plastic zipper, and brushed metal hardware ensure longevity and durability. I purchased this for my Zondervan auth. KJV bible, and it's dimensions are: 5.8"" x 0.9"" x 8.7"". It's a bit roomy but for the most part this bag fit well. The bag even had room to contain my NWT bible!

The said NWT has the dimensions of  4.8"" x 1.4"" x 6.8"". The compass on my bag worked as it should, bare in mind that the compass must lay flat to freely spin. And that is a nice addition to a great product.",5.0

My 10 year old daughter requested this Bible cover because it came with a compass. She loves this case! It has a ton of little pockets for all her little doo-dads. The material is very sturdy. This is a very good quality case.,5.0
"awesome, alot of room for my properties. Looks fashionable and easy to carry.",5.0
Great cover.  Sturdy.  Works awesome.,5.0
"Good quality! Purchased for our son who joined the Army and started going to church. Rugged construction, just as he needs.",5.0
"Overall very nice bible case. Sturdy enough construction and the hardware appears to be strong as well. The compass is junk, just toss that aside. Plenty of room for my large Bible, some notes or pamphlets in the secondary pouch, and challenge coins in the little pockets.",5.0
I bought it as a gift. She really loved it.,5.0
"I was very pleased with this bible cover. It's well built and sturdy. It seems to be water-resistant but not water-proof. I'm not sure why there's a compass on it, I think it may be to make it look more ""outdoorsy"". I took the compass off but have it in a small bag I use when I go camping. All in all I'd recommend this item to any of my friends.",5.0
"Made from light weight very durable material with a unique color.  Position of zipper could be better to allow one to open the Bible further while studying.  The zipper will if one does not watch it, fray the Bible cover.",5.0
He really loves the bible cover and that it comes with the compass. What a wonderful present for a young man.,5.0
I enjoyed using this bible bag. It serves its purpose and it's practical. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a bible carrier.,5.0
"Cover exactly what I needed.  My boy scout needed a cover for his handbook.  More than enough room for his book, papers, pen and extra stuff.  Love the mesh pocket on the front!",5.0
"Good, sturdy Bible bag with helpful pockets.  I love the mesh pencil pocket so you can easily tell if you have pen with you.  The notebook pocket on the outside (hard to see- it is the same length and width of the bag, but only .5 inch deep) is helpful for paperwork.  It fits an Awana Sparks handbook.  The main interior section about 2 in. deep.  The size is generous.  I tested my husband's large hardcover MacArthur Study Bible inside - it fits well. The compass/carabiner is good quality and has stood up to roughhousing, etc. from my son.  Overall, it is a quality bag and perfect for any boy's Bible.",5.0
It's perfection. I was looking for a cover for my new bible and couldn't find the perfect one until I came across this one. Love it.,5.0
"I ordered this to cover a KJV Thompson soft cover bible. It is exactly what I was hoping for. As other reviews state, the COMPASS DOES NOT WORK, but I was not looking for a functional compass to carry around with my bible anyway. I may leave it attached as the nonfunctional accessory I believe it was intended to be. The picture is washed out some. The color is a bit darker than the pic, but that just means it won't show wear as easily. I am extremely pleased with the design and the quality. The pockets are perfect for my mini post notes and sticky tabs. The extra pocket at the top will be perfect for bulletins or my non-interleaved catechism book. There is nothing I do not love about this case. I am thrilled with this product. If you have a standard ""pew sized"" bible, This case will be a bit big. Though you may be able to use the extra room to carry any extras you may want for your studies.",5.0
I really like this bible cover it protects my bible and it has lots of pockets for storageand a compas for an added bonus,5.0
I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a rich olive green color.  The material is durable.  My daughter loves it because its not the typical bible cover.,5.0
"So far looks great its a gift for my son, hope the plastic zipper holds up. But over all looks nice I think he will love the compass and little pockets.",5.0
This is a cover for my teenage son and it is cool.  It is durable and attractive cover and he doesn't mind bringing it to youth group.,5.0
"Terrific cover for other types of books as well. Bought this for my son's Boy Scout handbook and then had the velcro flap embroidered with his name. The fact that it fulls zips is the best selling point ever. We put post-it notes in the two small pockets and so far the elastic at the top of the pen holder is firm enough to keep the pens from sliding out. Really wish BSA would talk to this manufacturer.

The one thing is that I probably could have been fine getting the L size. There's a lot of movement inside because the BSA handbook is not as big as a Bible, but the zipper saves the day.",5.0
"I really enjoy this Bible cover.  The cover fits snugly over my Complete Jewish Bible and holds better than my previous Bible cover.  I like the military-looking cover without being the common camouflage style.  This Bible cover also has a lot of pockets where I can store my pens, mints, and note paper.  The added key ring also is good for me to attach any important keys (for keeping track).",5.0
"I bought this book cover for my son's Boy Scout Handbook. It's plenty big enough and even holds some extra drawing paper and vellum for leaf rubbings. Durable ripstop nylon and the color is the perfect olive drab. The compass seems to be durable as well.
I would recommend this cover to other Boy Scouts looking to protect their handbook and manage a few extra writing accessories.",5.0
"I bought this cover to go on the spiral bound Boy Scouts of America handbook, but it was way too big for that purpose. However, it is a really cool looking cover. I sent it back and got the medium size which is a better fit, though still not perfect.",5.0
"So far this cover seems to be quite sturdy. My son loves it, but he was disappointed that the compass on his didn't work. This was not a big problem, though, as we purchased him another compass and he was happy. The zipper is big and strong, and the front pocket is the perfect size for his AWANA handbook and a small notebook.",5.0
Love this bible cover.  Bought it for my 8 year old son and he loves it.  Loves the color and the compass on it.,5.0
"I purchased this bag for my son to carry his Bible in.  He loves it and says his friends all think it awesome too.  It fits his Bible and still has plenty of space for extra papers, pencils, etc.  The compass is an added bonus.  He has the NIrV Adventure Bible for early readers which measures 8.75"" X 5.75"" X 1.75""",5.0
The pocket in the front is the same size as the bible and is perfect for a small notebook for bible study notes and can stash pens and sticky tabs in it too.  Fits the Zondervan Study Bible perfectly.,5.0
Got this for a family member going into the military.  This one was nicely put together and the person I gave it to liked it. It held the Bible well. I'd buy one again.,5.0
"Bought for son to use at church. The color appears lighter in the picture. It is actually a dark camo green. Son likes it and loves the little compass but hasn't needed the compass, just for looks imho. Sturdy cover that will for sure last him many, many years.",5.0
"I got this for my adult son. It seems real sturdy and all the pocket spaces are great for pens, small tablet & misc. I bought this along with the Personal size Life Application Study Bible NIV. According to the dimensions of both I thought the case would have had a bit extra room with the Bible in it...it has ALOT of extra room.  The case is much to big for that size of Bible but he has plenty of room for booklets or study guides along with his Bible and it's great for toting it all around.  I don't know how the fit would be with other size Bibles, but it is a nice and sturdy Bible case.",5.0
My own fault for not paying attention to the dimension but the zipper is first rate. The compass is inspiring and I love it for my bible! I can fit my pens in there and my kiddos check in cards for church so I don't even need to bring my purse in from the car.,5.0
"These Bible Book Covers make great covers for Boy Scout Handbooks.

The Medium in particular has several extra pockets on the front for scouting doodads.

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

"This item was just waht I wanted. It arrived on time and I loved it. The price was ok....
The only thing that I don't like about this product is the face that it's not a real leather. besides that, it's great.",5.0
I was looking for a bible cover for my NIV Archaeological Study Bible and came across this one which happened to be 50% at The Family Christian Store!  From first glance I liked the Leather look and after closer inspection had a feeling that this cover would be a good fit with my bible and I was correct!  Not only was it a good fit but is very well stitched!  I found the zipper on this cover to be very smooth unlike covers I have had in the past and am very pleased with my choice.  I should have picked up a couple of more while I was at the store but they went quickly!  Highly recommended!  Very stylish looking and protects your bible very well!,5.0

"I am very happy with this cover, which I purchased through my wifes Amazon Prime account.  The product description includes the words leather-look and leather bound, which is just weird.  Regardless of its DNA, its very realistic looking, very comfortable to hold, and has a good zipper.  The attached label states that it fits the following: Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Large Print; NIV Quest Study Bible, Large Print, and NIV Life Application Study Bible.  I have the NIV Life Application Study Bible, Large Print Indexed by Zondervan, which fits perfectly.  I highly recommend this combination.",5.0

Fits a MacArthur study Bible great.  It just has about an inch extra of vertical space...side to side is about perfect.  Interior pockets are nice and there is a bit of extra depth to use them.

"The map was in very bad shape. We would have returned it, but we didn't have time to get another one. It would have been great if it had been packaged better.",1.0
Size is not as specified in the order. Very thin laminate. After the strip bends left. I thought it would look better.,1.0
"I bought this map for my classroom. Something that is not clear from the photo is the dismal, dark, dead-foliage coloring. It is much darker in person than it appears on Amazon, and has a black border.

Why all the states are shown as dark olive, purple, dull burnt orange, or brown beats me. Unless your nose is close to the map, you cannot read the names (in black) of most of the states. You can't even easily distinguish the borders of the states! Moreover, the map shows EVERY interstate highway, which makes it hugely busy and adds to the difficulty in reading it.

I am returning this map. I'm sure I can find something better for my 8th grade classroom.",1.0
"I ordered my map on August 22, it is now sep 9.  I paid for tracking, it told me that it arrived at my local UPS station on aug 29.  This is the second time I have ordered this item and NOT recieved my product. however, I was fully refunded after the first time.",1.0

"The top part of the laminate was crumpled when I received it. I do not know what to do about it, either cutting if off or finding a frame to cover the top. As of now it is sitting in the cupboard till I think if how to fix it",1.0

"There are two words that appear to be mis-spelled on the certificate, and the spaces are too small to enter the names.  These are un-usable.",1.0

"I am a busy Mom of 4 children.  I really thought this binder/organizer was going to be great, but I am left very disappointed, and wishing I could get my money back.  I like the idea of it, but the execution is all wrong.  There are pocket folders in each section.  Sounds fantastic, but the pocket folders are the same exact size as a piece of paper...but then 3 hole punched to fit it in the binder.  Basically, you cannot easily fit a piece of paper in the folders because it isn't large enough.  Second, there is a LOT of useless information in here.  The organizer is big, bulky and the pages are very hard to turn.  I like the size of the calendar, but the website link for refill paper does not work.  I took the calendar portion out of it and put it in a smaller binder.  Save your money.  I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it 0 stars, so I guess the 1 star is because it's pretty.",1.0
This planner is way too large and they need to rework the weekly planning part of it. I returned it.,1.0
I should have known better to buy this. Who in their right mind would carry a big bulky binder around. This is way too big to be an effective organizer for mom's on the go.,1.0
Bought this for my daughter and the plastic rings making up the spine of the book is not good......pages just keep coming out when you turn the page....too big of gap between the rings.  Would not buy it again.,1.0
"The Ten Commandments are written in a way that could be understood by even a child in the scriptures, and if it is not understood, may be you need to spend more time with your child.

Adultry not only applies to a spouse,  but also unto God. Scripture goes on to say if a person looked upon another with lust they have committed adultry with person in their heart.

"For a Homeschool product, endorsed by some of the highest respected organizations in the business, I was terribly disappointed and put off that this is made in China. BOO HISS!  I purchased the binder/planner set for around $50 for both.  For THAT price, I would have expected AMERICAN made products.

The paper is mediocre at best - I am sincerely worried that it won't have the strength and endurance for carrying around that a planner is made to do.  Spiral bound, yes, but reinforced? Certainly not.

Had I known, I would have NEVER purchased this product.  Keep our money and jobs local please.  That's what America is built on.  It's one of the proud mantras of the homeschool community, the fact we have the freedoms we do ... because we're Americans.",1.0
This item is not shippable to Canada..Why not? Can't contact the people who sell the planner..they don't respond to emails or have a contact phone number,1.0
"I should think that something as general and seemingly non-biased as a *daily planner* would be without religious influence, or be described as such in the item description. I suppose I should have read the other 5 star reviews more thoroughly. Almost every aspect of this planner is faith oriented, to put it mildly...from daily bible verses to weekly catechisms. It even goes so far (in one of its periodic articles) as to describe the secular culture as being an enemy. This mindset is not startling, but the fact that it is in a *planner* certainly is. Is it assumed that every homeschooling family is fundamentally Christian? Well, we're not. It's too bad this planner is so heavily inundated with god and his army, as it actually does have some nice points. Hesitant to purchase any others online.",1.0
"The photos on this calendar are nice, but the print on each line is very small. So small that I couldn't give it as a gift and had to keep it even though I already have one. I do not recommend unless the publishers increases the size. The pages may need to be larger to fit larger print.",1.0
"If you want to learn how to draw Zentangles, this book is not for you!
It states to deliver ""How to create Zentangle art"" but beware, you will find very little information on how to. It does not contain any basic Zentangle patterns and relatively few ""pure"" Zentangle images for a book about Zentangles. The Zentangle images shown are examples of elaborate art works, somthing you can aspire to, but this book won't get you there, and you might not like 'ornate' as much as the authors.

While giving very limited advice on practical ""how to"", the book might appeal to you if you are intersted in the spiritual side of ""zentangling"" (breathe, slow down, feel gratitude and appreciation...). I was hoping the book would provide the real 'how to' & Zentangle patterns, but was very dissapointed. I found what I was looking for  in  'One Zentangle a Day', a brilliant, honest book that delivers the basics as well as the finer details that make your Zentangle stand out.",1.0
"i have to change my review from five stars to one -- because while using the calendar, i have recently discovered that the end of january, all of february and most of march are missing.  (in their place are pages from september/october.)

"I read the reviews about this item (appx 100) and decided to give it a try. 1 1/2 weeks ago I got what I thought was pink eye. After 3 antibiotics, (first 2 did not work) I am finally almost cleared up. I went to the opthamologist who asked, is anyone in the family sick?no,Is anyone at work sicK?no.
She examined my eyes,concluded I had a raging infection (already knew that!) and as I was about to leave the office. I just happened to mention that I had  used a eyelash growth product on the tuesday night before bed and by 8pm wednesday night my eye infection started. I live in a small town and the Dr.s office is in the same town, I say that cause it is not like a chain or a large practice that sees hundreds of pts. She stopped writing my new prescription and said that I was the 3rd patient to come in with an eye infection after using (other brand not known) an eye lash growth serum. I said the tube was sealed and looked new, she said that it is possible that these products are not made in a sterile environment and that could transmit bacteria to cause an infection. I am not saying that this product absolutely caused my infection, but to be the 3rd person in the small practice that just happened to have this happen must be suspected there may be a problem.

"Order arrived in pristine condition.  Received customary strong, sturdy Amazon box.  Within Amazon Box were 10 individual boxes, each containing one (1) resistance band, individual Exercise Program using the band and a door anchor (also to use with specific exercises with the Bands).  In other words - everything you need to get started and in guaranteed excellent condition in it's individual box.  I opened all my boxes this morning and, what can I say other than I am utterly delighted !!!  The products were shipped in perfect condition and please allow me to thank you for offering products of such exceptional quality.  The Fitness Center, which is one of the locations where I work as an Independent Contractor uses Spri products exclusively.  Although I have not had an opportunity to use the Resistance bands I just received from B.M.P., I can tell by observation that they are by far superior.  The handles alone are more than double the size of the Spri models.  The Spri models handles are hard plastic only.  Your padding and larger size will make them much more comfortable in the hands of not only all the members, but in particular the Senior population with whom I work.  Seniors often have grip issues, and I can tell already they will prefer the B.M.P. models. Also the quality of the band itself is superior to the Spri ones we use.  The rubber is higher quality and although they stretch to the capacity they should (given the different weight strengths), it's obvious these bands will not become ""overstretched"" as quickly as the Spris.

All in all - I'm very impressed !!!  I called BMP directly, with some other questions, and experienced TOP QUALITY Customer Service.  Thank you BMP and Amazon for a great product at a great value!

This is a fair and independent review and I DID NOT receive my Products as part of a Review process.  I paid the Amazon price for them.  Thank you",5.0
I purchased a red band sometime ago and I decided to purchase the purple band because the red one was such a good product and still has its elasticity like day one.

I bought this green one and ended up buying the blue one too for less resistance.  You don't realize how tight 10 pounds can be until you try to do arms.  Make sure you check the color guide before purchasing!,5.0
"I am new to resistance bands. I have always used weights and medicine balls for strength training. I like the band because it is a different challenge to my stability and balance while providing resistance. I've had this band for a couple weeks and have been using it a couple days a week that I am not lifting weights. I haven't done any lower body exercises with it. But I work on my arms and shoulders most, back and chest some too. I can see how you could go light with it, but with enough reps I work up a good burn. One of my favorites is an ""uppercut"" motion while standing on the band. It seems to hit something weights can't quite duplicate. As to quality, this feels like a well-made product. The grips are comfortable. The length works well for the routine I'm on (I'm 6' tall). The ""catch"" that sticks in a door jam is the essential element for most of my exercises. You can put it under the bottom or middle hinge. Or you can put it over the top hinge. My door won't quite close with the catch lodged in there, but it doesn't swing open and unhook my band. You will need to find a place in your house/apartment where your door hinges provide you the space to extend the band for whatever exercise you're doing. Overall I'm really happy with this product. Also got a good price compared to what I've see at big box retailers for bands that seem similar.",5.0

I bought one of these for working out at home when I would be unable to go to a gym or was on a trip. The handles are quite comfortable and the rubber itself is well made so there is no issues with wear and tear and the included guide is quite helpful if you are unsure of what you want to do. Overall the bands themselves are well made and long enough to use comfortably. They are great for living in a small apartment with not a lot of space for the heavy exercise equipment so to be able to get a decent workout in on a busy day from home is a great thing and these get the job done. I do wish that I had more than one of the bands.,5.0

"Half the price of the other brand I replaced it with, and the quality seems equal.  In fact, possibly better, as I like the padded handles.  Also, they come with an attachment for securing them in a door jamb.  I will look for this manufacturer the next time I need one.",5.0
This product did a lot more than I thought. All you need is yourself and a door.,5.0
Started using resistance band as soon as a received it in the mail. I choose the red band because of the strength is the heaviest. I must say this works great! I love the anchor for the door as well. You can feel the burn even more. The grips are easy to clean too after a work out. If you're looking for a good resistance band then I'd choose these guys. Plus they shipped out right away.,5.0

came quickly",5.0
"I'm doing some upper body rebuilding after an injury and thought I'd try the Black Mountain Bands. I find them a great alternative to free weights and something I can pack easily when traveling. The door anchor that is included can be used both in a door stop or you can slip a dowel through the loop to stand on or to use under a door for a different pulling angle. I have two bands now and intend to purchase more as my resistance needs grow. Also, you can actually double up the bands as the pull handles are padded enough to hold two in your hands (I wear medium sized gloves, so smaller hands might have trouble with this). Also Black Mountain makes a set with removable/swappable handles to make multiple-banding easier.",5.0

good values for the cost nice bands,5.0
I love the convenience of being able to resistance train at home without having to purchase expensive weights. This band has been a great addition to my home workout routine. The quality is excellent and I love that the handles are cushioned so it is much more comfortable and I can use it longer than other resistance bands. Great purchase!,5.0
excellent quality and didn't broke until now ...,5.0
Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps.,5.0
Very happy- came as ordered. I haven't tried using to wall anchor yet but it looks very durable. Will update when used,5.0
"This resistance band is very nice , provides exactly what I need to get an extra burn in my workouts. Can be used for biceps , resistance running and all other exercise.

I chose the purple band , beats all other prices at retail stores and worth the price. It is very durable , it hasn't stretched out ... Yet.

I recommend this product.",5.0
"This is a fine quality resistance band and does its job well. The door jamb is especially thick, so if your door gap is unusually narrow you'll need to find a different door to use this with, but the tradeoff is a very secure feeling jamb. Band feels good stretched a few times its length. Simple.",5.0
Good quality product for a low price.  The only downside is that I was hoping for something I can travel with and the handles are a bit heavy. Up side is that the handles are comfortable and perfect for a home workout.,5.0
great workout with them,5.0
"This product is exactly what I was looking for.  It's great that it comes with several step-by-step exercises.  I've actually tried out some of them.  Since I recently joined a gym, it helps with my at home strength exercises.",5.0
"I had returned a Zon Resistance band and wrote a poor review of that product. This product however, was better, stronger and most important, hasn't broken.  I needed a strong band and purchased the purple. Wow, great resistance for me.",5.0
This product was as described! The door hook is very practical and useful. The yellow band seemed a little bit more tighter than what I have used in my fitness center but has been loosening up since then! The attached exercise book is equally helpful. Would recommend this product and the seller!,5.0
So far so good! Seems to be holding up well with daily use. And VERY comfortable grips! I love holding the grips lol. They feel so nice!,5.0

"There are a whole lot of brands of resistance tubes available in the market; but, there are distinct differences in quality that exist & should be considered. My last 3 resistance tubes (bought from a local national sports store; & online vendors) snapped in only 4 months. I decided to try a reputable brand/company. Black Mountain Products came very highly reviewed; & I immediately observed differences in the quality of the rubber used. Black Mountain is thicker & has good rebound/spring. I also really appreciate their commitment to product support & customer satisfaction; they warranty their products for life & genuinely seem to value the customer. So far my experience with BMP has been extremely positive.
From now on when I'm comparing exercise products I'll look for Black Mountain.",5.0

"Quality resistance bands from a company that back its product.  This band is high resistance.  I have had a set from Black Mountain already.  One band had the handle break.  With a simple phone call and email, they replaced it.  Good product with excellent service. Do not buy bands with any metal rings or attachments.  When the band finally breaks, you may not like the metal rings flying toward your face.",5.0
Great product for a great price! I have used this band for a few weeks and it's perfect for several different exercises. As a personal trainer I like to try out different products so I can tell my clients what to buy for a good home workout. These bands are a must!,5.0
excellent product and service,5.0
"I love it, using it for Golfer's elbow.",5.0
I got this for my girlfriend because she wanted to do resistance training but was bot comfortable with weights. So far she loves it. The bad provides adequate resistance with lots of flexibility for exercises that can be performed. Tested it myself and it actually feels like a 15lb band comparable to weights over the course of a full workout. They have been used for over a month now and so far they show no signs of damage and stretch quite far.,5.0
It works really well! I needed it as a modifier for some pull ups/chin ups and the door anchor helped. I'll probably buy it in a few more colors.,5.0
Works great to stretch out rotator cuff.,5.0

Does the trick!  Stays put in door,5.0
"I bought this to get back into working out.  I was struggling to find time getting to the gym and I didn't see a point in investing in an elaborate work out machine or getting multiple weights to lift with.  After doing some research I decided to try this out.  First off, I like that it is light weight. I have taken this on one trip so far and it fit super easily in my luggage without any extra weight.  Second I liked how versatile this band is especially with the door weight.  So basically, the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises.  I found that the anchor was sturdy and I didn't have much trouble with it.  The band itself has seemed pretty sturdy along with the handles.  I've gotten some good use out of this band and have had no troubles with it.  I feel that I can get in a decent work out when I can't make it to the gym.",5.0
This will help you get some workouts in. Very durable and so many exercises you can do and will help you stay active if you're traveling and have no time to stop by a gym.,5.0
As advertised!,5.0
"I purchased the orange resistance band, and am satisfied with my purchase. I am a 19 year old male, about 5' 10"", 155 lbs. The orange resistance band is a great band for male starters, I believe. After a couple days using the band, however, I believe that I could have used a band one or two resistance weights higher. If you consider yourself a stronger male, I would go perhaps one weight above the orange band.

As for the band itself, it is very handy. It is portable, so you can take your workout anywhere. I have had no structural problems with the band, as it looks well made. The band comes with an instructional booklet, so you can test out different exercises. I love using the band, because you can get the same workout as a weight bench from just a single resistance band. The attachment for the door is also handy, allowing you to do pull downs, rows, presses, and even squats. After a couple weeks of use, the band shows no signs of wear, despite stretching it to full capacity.

Note: if you are looking for simple stretching for sports warm-ups, you may want to take a look at a lighter band.",5.0
The band serve it's purpose. The description of the tension was on point.,5.0
"I have no issues with this. It looks like the photo, does what they say it will do, and came with a booklet of ideas on how to use it. The door strap thing at first glance had me questioning how in the world that would work, but it did. I'm happy.",5.0
I really like this resistance band. It has enough pull to get a good workout anywhere! Quality is good!,5.0
"I have had their purple and black bands, and needed a little stronger band.  This is definitely a stronger band, my goodness, it looks like a water hose.  After one use, it will no doubt take time to build up the strength to use it on all exercises.  It seems to be built to hold up for a long time.",5.0
"This resistance band works great, I do wish I had gotten a higher weight.",5.0
"good quality, would purchase again",5.0
Great product,5.0
I love this resistance band. The Green Atomic band is truly a heavy one (70Ibs to 75Ibs). I get a good pump when doing band flies for my chest. For now I have to step on the band on the floor with my feet and use one arm bicep curls because it is truly a heavy band for me. One arm at a time. The Atomic one is really heavy.,5.0

"Black Mountain bands are usually great, I've had a set that's lasted a few years.  Got this one and the handle broke; contacted customer service on social media and they replaced it with no hassle!!  It's unreal to have that kind of service in today's phone tree world.

As for this specific band, it's the perfect weight and is well-made; the band won't break.",5.0
"I do a lot of traveling where I usually don't have access to a gym, and lugging around dumbbells just isn't very practical.  This product seemed like it might be the solution to my problem.  I'd never really heard much about resistance bands in the past and so I decided to give them a try, and now I don't know how I ever lived without them.  I throw them in my luggage wherever I go and I can continue to work my shoulders, biceps and back in my regular routine no matter where I happen to be.  The resistance feels just right, and they haven't shown any signs of wearing out even though I've put them through a lot of use now.

For anyone who moves around a lot, or if you just don't like the hassle of keeping dumbbells and other bulky equipment around at home, definitely try out the Black Mountain resistance bands.  They're great quality and really made me a believer in strength training through resistance equipment.",5.0
Love resistant bands and the amount of exercises you can do with them! High quality rubber band that has lasted several months of garage gym use with no fraying or signs of deteriorating . This band is high quality and the handles are very comfortable. Would recommend the Black Mountain Products and wouldn't have any issue going back and purchasing more!,5.0

"These Resistance Bands from Black Mountain Products (BMP) are AMAZING!!!  I purchased the 5-pack bundle a couple of years ago and they are still going Strong!  They have not broken, yet may be a little stretched from the past 2 years of use 2 times a week.  Over the past two years I have gotten stronger and therefore justifying my purchase of the 70-75lbs lime green resistance band from BMP.  I did not realize how Strong this resistance band was.  I quickly understood it was Strong when I unpacked it.  It is HUGE!  I placed a tape measure around it and it is 2.5 inches around.  It almost looks like a water hose.  It's GREAT!!  I hooked it up to the door using the door anchor that came with it, and tried to stretch it out and I could Not even get close to the Strength of this Lime Green Monster.  It is EXCITING having a resistance band that will CHALLENGE me and make me adapt my workouts to a resistance band that is EXTREMELY STRONG!  I look forward to the next few months as I STRUGGLE with this Lime Green Monster!  The cost is worthy of the product you receive.  You will Not be disappointed.  I highly recommend this Lime Green Monster from Black Mountain Products and Highly recommend Black Mountain Products resistance bands!  I think I am going to purchase the Purple Monster (45-50lbs) from BMP and add it with this one and rotate my workout between the two.  I can't imagine using two of the Lime Green resistance bands at one time!  One is bad enough!",5.0
Needed a stronger band than what I had previously. This works great!,5.0
"Great bands. So far so good, Perfect length for my height",5.0
"This is the second Black Mountain band that I bought and obviously I like their products.  It is not expensive, but it works great.  The door plug that keeps it works very well and will prevent spring back. Handles are comfortable.  I found one nice feature is to put one handle in each hand, or double the force and put two handles in one hand.l It appears to be high quality surgical rubber that will last a very long time.

I bought the first to help with a shoulder injury and the second, this one, to give me a little muscle exercise when traveling.  Packs easily and keeps me fit.

Seems to be from a good family-owned company with a quality product.  I have not needed customer service but phone number is prominently provided",5.0
Does its job.,5.0
This band is a lot more thick and sturdy than I ever could've imagined! Great for doing rows hooked to a pole while I sit on the ground and also for lat pulls. Seems like it will last for the long haul as I use it regularly and hasn't seemed to change in about a month of moderate use. Great heavy band.,5.0

I use this band for the P90x program and I love how soft the handles are. This band in particular (red) really seems like the perfect weight needed for starting the first month of the program. Will definitely come back to buy the next higher tension band from here as I progress through the three months.,5.0
"High quality resistance bands. This is my second purchase from Black Mountain and I couldn't he happier with my product. The handles are comfortable and offer good grip. The band itself offers a great workout. If you are going to purchase bands, buy this brand.",5.0
"Great band that I can stretch in any direction. I just got it and love working muscles that are difficult to do with weights. The padded handle is very comfortable, since an unpadded hard handle would be uncomfortable. Main two issues are: that the door strap needs a door with a wide enough gap and unfortunately my door seals shut so I tie it to a sturdy piece of furniture; and the rubber is not very long and could be an issue for tall folks who don't have a high enough anchor point (works fine for me at 5'9"").",5.0
This product is true to its description of weight (45-50 lbs). It can be taken anywhere and has a very sturdy door anchor. Definitely an awesome product if you are considering weight training with no actual weights! Super convenient to take with you if you are traveling!,5.0

I recently bought this resistance band for my Beachbody workouts. I love that I can change the resistance by making it shorter and that I don't have to store a bunch of different sized weights. Not to mention it is so easy to travel with! This band is great quality and I can tell that its durability will last a long time. The handles have a great cushion to them and are very comfortable to use. I haven't used the door feature yet but I do like that the band comes with a booklet of exercises that I can do and explains how to use the door feature. The only negative is that I wish the band were a little longer. There are some exercises that I do that require the band to be under both feet or all the way over your head while the band is under your feet. Its easy to modify for the length of the band but I do wish it was a little longer.,5.0

This resistance band is an excellent addition to my workout.  I am 72 and use the band both at home with recommended resistance moves and during interval training while walking.  The bands are so simple and easy to store as well as travel with and yet strengthen  a large range of muscle groups.  My family has to strength bands now and will be getting a third resistance level to round out our workouts.,5.0

My overall experience was excellent.",5.0
"I bought the orange resistance band about a month ago, and so far I am well satisfied. The rubber is great material that should not dry rot anytime soon as long as it is kept inside.

"Was looking for a band that would provide a good amount of resistance and came across Black Mountain Products.  Read the reviews and like what I saw, especially for the price.  Picked up the purple band, heaviest they offer, and was VERY pleased with it out of the box.  A few weeks and many workouts later and I'm still as happy with the quality of the band as the first day I used it.  I will most certainly be purchasing more bands from the company in the future.

A great bonus, inside the box was a piece of paper with a phone number and and offer for a free band.  Called the number and was expecting to speak to an automated system or some typical customer service rep with an attitude.  Was pleasantly surprised to speak to a gentleman that seemed as happy to talk to me as I was to get a normal person with a good attitude.

Looking forward to doing much more business with them in the future.",5.0

"great exercise band.  super easy to use, good amount of resistance and great for a work out anywhere.  if you had the excuse of not having enough space or time to work out then you can't make any excuses with this band.  it has a good amount of resistance for both males and females.  don't expect this to build up huge muscles though. this is for those that want a toned body (arms) and are ok with using resistance as a mean of doing so.

personally i like the toned look than the bulk so this is perfect for me.  i can put this in my luggage so i can carry it when i travel and work out in the hotel.  theres enough amount of exercises you can do with it so you can work out several body parts with a flick of the wrist.  the product itself seems durable and of good quality.",5.0
Excellent product...better than the equipment I use at local gyms and fitness centers. Highly recommend.,5.0

I've never avidly used resistance bands until now and I'm happy that these were my first bands. They are very well made and come with a handy door anchor and booklet with exercises. I chose the Green (medium) bands equal to lifting about 10-15 lbs. Handles are well cushioned and the band itself is strong enough that I am confident that it will be a long time before it starts to wear out. Great price too! Highly recommend!,5.0

"I started a club with band strength training and I have been building up a home/travel collection of bands to use and I really like the Black Mountain bands they have a slightly different feel to their handles but the quality matches what they have in the gymn and the other, apparently no name bands that I received as a gift.

I will be looking to fill in more of the bands as budget allows, and I think I'm going to go with a set of the fixed Black Mountain bands as they appear to be fairly decent quality.

As for a workout, if you are thinking about using bands, they are effective and all your truly need to get toned.  I use them in the gymn setting and the workouts go by fast, can easily be increased to make sure you are reaching muscle failure and are flexible for all major muscle groups. I'm a workout novice, but love using them and I've had striking results in just months.",5.0
"Doesn't get any easier than this.  You slide the flap in between a door, then shut it, then loop the bands through it.  The padded end hangs on the other side of the door so it doesn't move.  You can adjust the height by moving the flap up.  There is nothing to ""install"" and no tools are involved.",5.0
Great product that is easy to use.,5.0
I bought this band so I could exercise between meetings and calls at work. I am just doing standing curls. This product works great! I would say the weight is closer to 40 lbs. I was seeing tears after a week of use and I called support. They were fantastic. They immediately sent out a new one. You have to watch to not go over 3 times the size of non stretched length. I would definitely by this product and from Black Mountain again.,5.0

Did not even take it out of the box. Has a very strong chemical smell. Probably from the tires.,1.0
"Would not recommend. Amazon lists this as USA made, but it's made in China! The box this came in was filled with a horrible chemical smell and the bike itself has the same smell. I had to leave it outside to air and the tired and streamers still smell. I had to cut the streamers off because if you touch them your hands will have the chemical smell on them. It's just ridiculous for a child's product to be so toxic. Very disappointed.",1.0
"The bike smells like smoke, like it was in a fire, thought it would go away but it is not.
can't believe you would sell something like this, whomever shipped it knew!!",1.0
"I'm very disappointed with this product, especially since it's impossible to find tricycles in bike shops where I live.

The rubber wheels smell like campfire as if something went wrong in the forging process. Even after several weeks they still smell.

The hubs on the rear wheels are poorly made. The shaft hole on each wheel is not perpendicular to the wheel, it's on an angle. So when viewed from behind, the wheels tilt outwards rather than being vertical. This causes them to wobble and make a horrible squeaking sound.",1.0
"Because I believe that American product quality, make light of travelling a thousand li to American buy, results received after found many places were scratched, very disappointed.",1.0
Made in CHINA what is up with that I did not know Radio Flyer was made in China. Very Very disapointed with purchase .,1.0
"Pros:
 - It looks nice...
 - Yeah, I don't have anything else here.

Cons:
 - NOT for 2 year olds!  The description says it's appropriate for 2-5 but it is WAY too big for an average 2 year old (and I know from our Dr. that my girls are pretty much average for 2).
 - Hard to assemble!  This is absolutely the hardest piece of children's equipment to assemble I've ever encountered.  Let's start by saying that I'm not particularly handy, but I have put together play sets, cribs, rocking horses and many other things for my kids and this was just the worst.  The pieces don't go together very well, one of the screws is basically impossible to put in (it goes under the foot stand at the back where there is not space for both a screw and a screwdriver to operate) and then there's the handle bars... they attach to the base of the bike basically by screwing down a clamp, which is already a stupid way to do it.  In order to keep the handle bars from moving independently you have to screw it in very hard, but when I attempted to do this I just stripped the heck out of the screw and STILL ended up with handle bars that are wibbly wobbly and sometimes turn without turning the wheel.  Anyway, could be partly my fault... but they honestly shouldn't be producing something that's so easy to mess up!
  - Fairly heavy.  Based on other reviews it sounds like it tips over easily but it's a really heavy thing which I would not want falling on my kids.

Anyway, we ended up buying some plastic Fisher Price tricycles instead and we LOVE those.  They were easy to assemble, a much better size and just overall such a better experience plus they were pretty much half the price.",1.0
"My 35 lbs./4 yo son crashed (onto grass, he suffered no injury and was laughing) after rolling down about a 2 and 1/2 foot hill on our lawn and the entire vertical piece of the handle bar cracked - not at a welded joint but the length of the entire shaft.  What a piece of junk.",1.0
My wife and I ordered this trike for our granddaughter and the first one we received was impossible to assemble because the primary bolt holes in the frame didn't align properly. We ordered a replacement which arrived promptly and much to our chagrin the problem was worse with the second trike. Very poor manufacturing standards.,1.0
I had a problem with the assembly due to a part (a bolt).  Customer service told me I had the wrong part and they would send the correct one.  3 weeks and 2 replacement parts later I found out that the original part was correct.  I discovered this on my own.  The part ( the bolt) did not match the assembly instructions (the picture or the part number).  Once I figured it out it was easy to complete the assembly.,1.0
The seat was broken on arrival. Looks like poor quality in the stem screw and hole. Had to be returned.,1.0
"Yet not open, till will visit my granddaughter,. for the Jewish Holidays, beginning of Sept, spending the holidays in NYC",1.0
"Save your money and buy a different trike. I bought this for my son and it was such a waste of money I wish I could return it. First the bike is a pain to put together. It is not very hard but the pieces don't fit together very well so there is a lot of adjusting and playing around you have to do. Second, the bike is very wobbly and you really can't fix it. Everything on this bike is so loosely held together that the bike is a wobbly mess. We tried to tighten it up but to no avail. Lastly, there are so many sharp edges on this trike you wonder what Radio Flyer was thinking. It is a cute trike but very poorly made.",1.0
"My daughter doesn't like it as she can'r stop when she need to, also it not comfortable when sit and ride it.",1.0
"the bike keeps tipping over during maneuvering and making turns. The front handles keep comming off.  It is a very heavy bike for a kid to maneuver. The back is heavier than the front, therefore there is no balance when riding the bike. It was not a good purchase.",1.0
Sorry to say but the product got a negative review for safety from children's magazine because it tips over easily.  We got it for our grandson and before we could give it we were asked to take it back.,1.0
"I bought this tricycle as christmas gift for my 3 year old son in December 2010. We could not use it till now because the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire.

The design is very bad. The handle bar is connected to the front tire completely by friction. No matter how much I tightened the clap which make the friction between handle bar and front tire, the handle bar still turns away from the from tire easily. So the handle bar and front tire cannot be aligned. This tricycle is completely useless.

I saw someone just drilled a hole and put a pin bwteen handle bar and front tire connection. Maybe that is the only solution.",1.0
"We bought these bikes for our 2 y/o son and 3 y/o daughter for Christmas.  While they look great and are very sturdy, they are just too darned big for a little toddler.  Even now 9 months later they still cannot sit on the seat and reach the pedals.  By the time they will be able to reach teh pedals they will be ready for a two wheeler.  My kids are not tiny either, my daughter is 50 percentile and my son is 90 percentile.  Get a smaller tricycle so your kids can ride it.  We have a Planet Kiddo hand me down (made in Germany) that is much smaller and my daughter rides that around.

Edited to add:  Now, when my kids are 4 and 3, they still cannot reach the pedals. I am going to get coaster bikes for them that can have pedals added later.  What a waste of money these tricycles were. It only gets ons start b/c I could not put zero stars...",1.0
"My 2-year is a tricycle riding maniac. He LOVES riding and can peddle so well. I bought this tricycle because he can comfortably reach the peddles. The problem is that it tips over VERY easily. I am searching for another trike that is more stable so I don't have to stay within a foot of him to try and catch him when he's about to have a bad fall. I recommend you find a tricycle with a lower center of gravity and a wider wheel base in back. However, my son enjoys it and it is durable.",1.0
"This trike is advertised with other trikes.  However, while the others are 10 inch trikes, this one doesnt inform the custumer that it is a 12"" trike and not suitable for 2 year olds.

It is beyond me why the size of this bike is not in the ad!

Isnt it fair to assume that if it is listed with other 10 inch trikes and no other sizes that this is a 10inch also?

This trike is much too big for a 2 yo.",1.0
I would never buy this trike again for a child.  It tips VERY easily when the child's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side.  Enough said.  Money wasted and damage done.,1.0
"This trike is too tall, and the front wheel is too small.  The result is that it tips over VERY easily.  I won't even let my two year old on it, because it falls over so easily.  My 3 1/2 year old can ride it straight on a totally flat surface, but we live on a cul-de-sac that has a slight slant to it, and any time she tries to turn it at all she tips right over.  Even the 4 year old boy next door falls down on this.  It's so tippy that the neighbors won't let any of their kids ride it!  Not only that, but the grippers on the handles come right off.  I love Radio Flyer, and I certainly have fond memories of their products from when I was a kid, but I wish I had gotten a lower, wider, safer tricycle instead of this one.",1.0
"My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use.  So, we thought we'd wait.  We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust.  Once it started, the rust couldn't stop.  So basically, a big waste of money.

Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler.",1.0
"My 2 1/2 year-old received this bike for Christmas.  We all loved its retro look and it seemed pretty sturdy.  He had only had it for a couple of days when we noticed he was peeling off the shiny metallic coating from the handlebars.  His grandmother tried to brush away the loose flakes and received several substantial cuts on her fingers and hand.  We got rid of the bike immediately!  Also, while it says it is appropriate for ages 2 and up, his older brother was barely big enough to pedal it.",1.0
"I ordered this bike as the main present for my four year old's birthday.  Imagine the disappointment when we could not sufficiently tighten the bolt that attaches the handlebars to the front wheel, so the handlebars turn independently from the wheel (making the bike unusable).  We called the manufacturer and they sent us a new part--we replaced it and it did not solve the problem.  Now they are sending us a different part.  Meanwhile, my daughter is still without a bike.",1.0
"My little guy received this trike from his Grandparents when he was two.  He could just reach the peddles and was very excited about it.  It took a few months before he could really reach the peddles and get moving on it.  Every time and I mean EVERY time he rides the trike it tips over on him and he ends up hurt.  As one of the other reviews states, I thought maybe he was turning to sharp but even when I hold on and help him turn slowly I feel it start to tip.  It's now hanging in the garage and he will not be riding it again.  We will be buying him a more stable/safe trike.",1.0
"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was about 2.  She loved all things red, so it seemed to be the perfect gift.  However, when kids try to turn, it flips over!  I thought it was just my daughter trying to turn too sharp, but my son has flipped it nearly every time he has tried it as well.  THe neighborhood kids have flipped it over as well, resulting in many scraped hands and knees but luckily no heads.  I AM THROWING IT AWAY!",1.0
"I bought two of these for my twin daughters who are 4-1/2 now and they still have trouble riding them.
The trike will topple over if the wheels are turned too sharply.  The center of gravity is too high for small children.  One of my daughters said she's rather just walk in the parade and wave a flag than learn how to ride it for the 4th of July parade.  That's when I decided I need to get her a different trike if her experience has been that bad.
Also, the bolts come loose and the wheel can turn without turning the steering wheel no matter how tightly the bolts are tightened.  Same with the seat - it wiggles.
The other daughter fell off the trike and the lever for the bell dug into her skin causing a bad scrape.
It's pretty and the bell has a lot of nostalgia but it hasn't been practical at all.  Trike riding should feel like a joy but with these, the kids think I'm giving them a chore when I say ""Let's go ride tricycles.""",1.0
"My daughter received this tricylcle for her second birthday. She is very tall for her age and already knew how to pedal a trike. She was so excited to get her first bike, but that excitement turned to frustration very quickly. She tipped over every time, even when she was not moving--just leaning over to look at the pedals. The center of gravity on this tricycle is much too high and the back wheel base is too narrow. We went to ToysRUs and let my daughter try out several other trikes and she loves the Kiddi-O Supertrike 4. A great bike that isn't a health hazard!",1.0
"I had the same problems and have written to Radio Flyer.  The handlbars do not stay in alignment (and I even got a replacement part to supposedly fix this problem) and the tricycle tips far too easily.  Don't fall for the rugged look, it is not worth the money.  Get something from another company made of plastic.  I find this bike dangerous and will not let my son ride it.",1.0
"We purchased this bike for our two and a half year old son, since it's age reccomendation was for 24 months through 5 years.  He could not reach the pedals, let alone the ground (and he is in the 75% for his height) and he was constantly falling over on it.  Also, the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire, so it was always turned sideways to make the bike go straight.  My neighbor also has this bike and hers does the same thing.  Finally, after about five months of my four year old riding it, the front tire has just completely broke off of the frame!!  We are very disappointed in the stability and quality of this bike.  It looks cute, but don't be fooled.  It is very top/front heavy and is always falling over when you make a turn.  Don't buy it!!!",1.0
"My son received this bike for his 3rd birthday from his grandparents.  We loved it's looks.  When the weather broke we took it outside and we were ready for some fun.  Well everytime my son turned the bike fell over.  When you turn it cuts too sharp and the bike tips over.  After three times of getting hurt that was it and he will not ride the bike now.  We thought maybe he was too young so we let our neighbors son ride, he is four he also fell twice and will not ride.  Last but not least we let a 5 year old try she also fell twice and that was it for her.  They look at the bike as if to say, ""I'm not riding that bike.""  So now it sits in our garage.  I will say though it is a beautiful bike just not made to turn.",1.0
"This is an amazing tool - beefy, smooth action and all the good stuff and I truly want to love it.  Why one star?  The Phillips screwdriver bit.

It is a classic study in manufacturing failure and will snap like glass the first time you use it.

Someone at SOG (or, more likely, one of their components vendors) couldn't be bothered to consider what happens when you stamp lettering right at a stress concentration point then harden a bit that will be subjected to considerable torsion (note in the picture that the crack follows the letter ""A"").  SOG's own parts listing is full of complaints about this and of course these aren't covered by the warranty.  If this is an example of their engineering or quality control, I can't wait to see what happens next.

You can read the reviews on SOG's own web site by searching ""Phillips screwdriver""

I'm sorry, but there are just too many good tools by good manufacturers out there to be a repeat customer for this kind of negligence.",1.0
None of the tools lock out like a leatherman.,1.0
"Worst Multi-tool ever! This thing is so tight it can't hardly be opened. The pliers hinge out, this is clumsy and also leaves a void in the handles so if you can open it, it's hard to use. Getting at anything, like the knife, is almost dangerous, be careful not to cut yourself. The idea that designers took this from paper, to a prototype, and then actually mass-produced this, is a joke. DON'T BUY!",1.0
"I am incredibly disappointed in this.  IMHO, it is a complete waste of money.  It is very difficult to use.  The pliers are always in the way and have to be manipulated before you can use ANYTHING.  The ""ruler"" is useless.  There are no scissors.  I own a Gerber Suspension which is light years ahead of this piece of junk.",1.0
"This ""educational"" toy is designed for 10 and up.  That could be because only a 10 year old would not realize how poorly designed this thing is.  It will require an IMMENSE amount of patience to complete.  I have been helping my daughter with this toy for WAY TOO LONG.  The pieces sort of snap together, but must all be glued.  They then need to be positioned into the plastic body and somehow held with 10 hands that can contort into unexplainable positions to hold it all in alignment with the body and be glued at the same time.  If it were not for the fact that my daughter REALLY wants this thing completed, I would have taken great joy in smashing it with a hammer.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is not extremely patient and who has the room on a spare table to glue all the pieces together, then assemble.......oh yeah, and get a bunch of mini rubber bands to hold it all together while drying.",1.0
"My 11 year old daughter bought this from a museum gift shop.  She loves horses and science and thought this would be fun.

We have spent hours assembling this thing.  Whatever you do, don't follow the instructions.  They are backwards.  If you do the skeleton first, there is no way to insert the organs.  The pieces are supposed to be able to be snapped together.  They don't.  Glue doesn't hold them either.  At one point the instructions told us to use cement - it was not included.  The box shows the organs different colors, they aren't.

We finally rearranged the picture instructions (there are very few words) and used clear packing tape to hold it together.  It now vaguely resembles the front photo.  The organs are all the color of Silly Putty and the leg bones are held in place by hope, prayer, and the clear outer case.",1.0

"This is a total piece of you-know-what. My 3-year-old son's feet have no shot at reaching the pedals (which were well nigh impossible to attach as one came semi-stripped and partially assembled incorrectly by a previous customer who returned it...that's my best guess). It took me and my wife hours and hours to put together and when we were finally finished (no thanks to, but rather in spite of, the imbecile-written instructions) the thing was unrideable. The photo here on the Amazon page has the front fender backwards and the actual thing here in front of me looks like a chopper compared to the photo. I have always held John Deere in high esteem. That they have the nerve to peddle such a product as this has certainly changed that. They're now on my you-know-what list. Oh, the worst part is the odor emanating from both the box and the bike. My entire house now smells like a chemical plant or burning rubber or moth balls or a propane leak or whatever that nasty toxic smell is. Either the rave reviews are fake or I'm living in bizarro land and have received some ersatz version of the tricycle.",1.0
"I saw a weather-beaten, rusty version of this trike outside a secondhand store recently.  It was obviously years old but still very sturdy.  I went inside to inquire, thinking that perhaps it could be refurbished, and the woman told me it was a $250 trike new and that she wouldn't take less than $50 for it.  I walked away and decided to do a little research.  That was a GOOD decision.

This is not a John-Deere or USA-made product.  If you look, you'll see several similar trikes with identical construction available at different retailers.
All are Chinese-made, presumably by one manufacturer.  Sometimes the handlebars vary, but the core of the tricycle does not.

Here on Amazon, search for Grip or All-Terrain Tricycle.
On Ebay, you can find them under Western Express.
At Harbor Freight, they call it All-Terrain Tricycle.

(There's also a USA-made Dirt King tricycle that's similar, but not identical; you might try that if you're set on paying over $200 for a tricycle.)

As for me, there's a shiny new red Harbor Freight tricycle on my front porch.  My little boy loves it, and I love the money I still have in the bank.

"I'm writing this review on a gorgeous Friday afternoon after a full week building a rooftop deck up and down a ladder all day- there are so many better things I've got to do right now, and I ordinarily NEVER write reviews, but I HAD TO chime in on this toilet of a cooler....
  2 words- STEER CLEAR! If you're a tradesman, opt for the side button coolers....I know they tend to lose the button if the cooler opens too far, but let me tell you my experiences with the top button release cooler:
  Day 1 on the job, I lift the cooler into the back of a pick up truck, only to have my forearm lightly touch the button..... cooler flips open and my lunch lands on the ground....not cool!
  Day 3 on the job, one of the laborers picked up my cooler to move it....again, lunch lands on the ground......broke my glass bowl that my cereal was in, so I had to go without at coffee break......now I'm getting irate :-@
  Alas, Friday afternoon (today), as I proceed to bring my cooler up the ladder, I lift it to put it onto the roof, again it flips open, lunch lands 2 stories down.....
  At that point, I'm beyond pissed! So I'd like to say this, now that I've had my 1 hour commute home to cool off: If I owned PLAYMATE INC., I would FIRE THE IDIOT DESIGNER/DESIGNERS that cape up with this design!!!!!! HE or SHE or THEY get a BIG F! This P.O.S. cooler design fails the consumer, and PLAYMATE ought to be recalling every one of these! If my lunch happened to land on the homeowner, or a passer by, while I was up on a ladder.... let's just say this, our clientele are 7 figure customers, I'm sure they've got very thorough attorneys......

  As for the positives with this cooler, If you're looking to lose weight, this cooler will manage to cut your food consumption for sure! In All seriousness, PLAYMATE makes a good product, generally speaking. This design modification from the side button release coolers to top button release coolers was the direct result of overpaid designers trying to reinvent the wheel- I'd like to quote a wise man, by saying ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT"". PLAYMATE ought to begin a new campaign, ""designed by tradesmen, for tradesmen"", fire the design staff, and hire actual tradespeople to design these products. As of today, this cooler is officially taken out of service. ZERO STARS!",1.0
"The top is just a single thickness of plastic with no other insulating qualities. Plus it has a hole in it where the latch mechanism passes through; that hole lets water in to soak the contents. So on sunny days the ""cooler"" becomes a little solar oven, and on rainy days it's a bathtub. Cheap design, all around.",1.0
"I was very disappointed that when I unboxed the Igloo Playmate Elite Cooler upon its arrival, it was considerably dusty/dirty giving the impression that the cooler was ""used"" (or sat unprotected in storage for a long time) and it was listed as ""NEW"" ... I attempted to clean it up, but it still has some light staining on the lid ... Of course, it is functional so I am not going to take the time to send it back; but I remain VERY DISAPPOINTED in Amazon ... This simply is not like them.",1.0
"I received this rack as a gift, so I didn't get to evaluate it before purchase.  I have a 2"" hitch receiver.  The included 2"" adapter is worthless, wobbly, and unstable.  The reason is the use of nylon and loose tolerance in the adapter.  Had to buy a steel adapter that fit from another vendor.  Don't trust the included cheap plastic bike straps unless you want to risk losing your bikes to following traffic.  Use plently of tiedowns that you provide yourself.  The horizonal bars that hold the bikes are attached to the upright pipe by screw knobs that are only hand-tightened and can back out.  The upright pipe is the one thing that is over-engineered and more sturdy than needed.  I would strongly recommend a potential purchaser spend more money for a better carrier.  It might be OK for taking a kid's bike to a neighborhood park, but that's about it.",1.0
"If you need a ""starter"" or ""disposable"" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.

Good parts:

Cheap, $99

Bad parts:

1.  Cheap

2.  The adapter for a 2"" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one.

3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something.

4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.

In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it.",1.0
I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target!,1.0
Ridiculous price for something you can buy for 1/2 of this price,1.0

"I bought this for my husband, and he was truly so excited about it because we had been searching for years for a replacement for his old one (that he had for years btw). Within the first 2 days the head flew off the handle, which was no big deal, my husband just pounded a couple extra shims into it and reattached it. But then I get a picture from him today that shows the entire head cracked down the middle of it! My husband is a framer, so he uses his tools for what they are made for, and he isn't always gentle with them, but I have never seen anything like that happen before. I would not waste my money on another one of these.",1.0
Handle broke the second time I used it.  Don't waste your money.,1.0
"Tthe initial resistance while pumping gave me the impression that i was using it wrong. Oh, but apparently there are no instructions that come with it to tell you exactly how to use it. So, I attach it and start pumping. The up pull is like picking up an anvil. I say that because I was trying to use a specific amount of pull because I didn't want to break it. But there's no way that it gives any indication that it's working. So I pull harder. After about 3 reps up and down, it broke off at the bottom end of the handle.

No wonder it only cost 10 bucks. Not even worth that, really.",1.0
"This will not pump up a basketball. It will pump up an air mattress, but if you try it with anything with much pressure, it doesn't work.",1.0
This product came with no instructions on how to fit the various valves and is therefore useless. I tried many combinations and all failed. No way to even determine if something is missing.,1.0

"The tire on our wheelbarrow has been flat for what seems like forever.  My husband and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new pump (our last expensive pump bit the dust too quickly) so I happened upon this little beauty.  Only problem is I didn't read all 3 pages of reviews!  If I had, I would have seen the ones that warn ""it doesn't inflate bicycle tires"" and I might have given this purchase a second thought.  Instead, I went by the review that said ""It inflates everything--tires, balls, pools... anything you need inflated!"" and bought it.  It inflated my daughter's kickball just fine, but it's utterly useless for my wheelbarrow wheel, which is the only reason I bought it in the first place!  BIG disappointment, but lesson learned:  READ ALL THE REVIEWS.",1.0
"In layman's terms, it sucked. Yes it did everything it was said to and more, but about 4 minutes after i opened it up and tried to use it, it broke. I put a little water on the needle and on my basketball and pumped it up. When I tried to take it out, the end nozzle separated from the needle. I couldn't even get the needle out, so I ended up having to cut open the basketball...But it did pump really well.",1.0
"We purchased many units, plugged them in all over the house, and they have been totally ineffective!  We still have mice and insects.  As a matter of fact, spiders have used it to anchor cobwebs!",1.0

"I bought these, hoping to finally get rid of the numerous spiders I have.  I could hear them ticking away in the different rooms I placed them in, but that's all they do---tick.

"Worked in the pest control industry for 16 years, till recently. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.
Rodents are often repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere).",1.0

My kids really like the Spalding Varsity outdoor balls so when their old ones wore out I decided to order some new ones. I however did NOT receive the Varsity ball. What I got was the Spalding NBA Junior Outdoor. Which is similar to the Varsity but the grip doesn't quite feel the same. I'm just going to live with my purchase because it was only $13.99 and do not want to hassle with returning it.,1.0
The ball was super old looking. It looked as if it had been left outside in the rain for a month,1.0

We received the basketball about two weeks ago. Since the last week we have had to pump it up once after each use. The product isn't recommended.

The ball arrived in descent package and looked like a good quality as well. However within two weeks it started loosing air and within a month imt would not even hold air for a day. Air seems to leak frm the port so it seems the valve is bad. I would not recommend this to anyone.,1.0

Go to Wal-Mart and buy the ball in the picture for $15. Maybe if enough people do it they'll change the picture.",1.0
There are 2 descriptions listed for this ball.  The Amazon description (stating it is made of rubber) is correct.  The Product description stating it is made of leather is incorrect.

Ball will not hold air and keeps leaking despite pumping it up six times. Very disappointing for a chrismas gift,1.0
"If you play basketball at ALL, you will hate this basketball.  It is that hideous rubber material that tears up your hands.  The grooves are super deep and are sharp where they go down.

"I'm sorry to say that I was very disapointed with the quality of this product. I had 2 concerns with the build quality of the sleigh, 1st the side rails were not mounted securely and were prone to wobbling which did not instill confidence in their safety factor. Secondly was with the mounting set-up for the runners of the sleigh, the surface that the runers mounted too was almost twice as wide as the actual runners themselves which caused the snow to build up under the sleigh creating a fair amount of drag, which could cause the sleigh to become unstable and tip over. I have since returned the sleigh and am currently looking for another that is built better.",1.0
"I ordered this sleigh for my nephew as a Christmas present and was disappointed upon receipt due to the quality and unfinished wood of the product.

Today I attempted to return and fell 2 days over the 30 day return window (with 15% restocking fee for only unopened purchases) and they will not accept my return.  I am floored.  My bad for missing it by 2 days but their fine print is ridiculous.  Apparently their standard return policy is 7 day and that's if the box is unopened????  Ummmmm how does that work?  I am really shocked that Amazon uses them as a vendor with policies like that!  I have never had an issue with any other purchase I have ever made on Amazon.

"We received this as a splurge gift from the grandparents. It LOOKS lovely and appears to be high quality however it is USELESS.

Neither of my babies (at sitting up independently stage) could not be pulled in the sled as the tugging of the rope caused the sled to tip backwards and dumped the babies out. DANGEROUS! I assumed it was due to their weight being too low.

I tried again in the toddler years when they were heavier and taller, thinking maybe then it would work but it didn't work.  It seemed stuck in the snow and would not pull. Then when we tugged harder or faster,  again the sled tipped backward and dumped the child out!

I asked two friends about theirs (when I saw them being stored in their garages!) and was told they didn't work for them either, but they too were keeping them since they were gifts from the grandparents and were nice wooden objects; they felt guilty giving the `like new' items away.

After allowing this lovely piece of woodworking to sit in my garage for twelve years I finally donated it to a thrift shop.

The most disappointing thing was this is not an inexpensive item and it is made by a reputable company FLEXIBLE FLYER yet it is completely USELESS and DANGEROUS!

There is a less beautiful, one piece solid plastic, brightly colored sled on the market for toddlers that actually glides in the snow and does not tip over, the PARICON 625 TODDLER BOGGAN. Consider buying that one, it works and is safe. Someone gave us that as a hand-me down and we used it with success.",1.0

"Nov 2013 - The product was ordered by a client to replace the worn torn original garage door weather strip. Given the horrible standards I repeatedly encounter with prefabricated materials, equipment and fixtures I did not just trust the package installation instructions.

The product did not disappoint my cynicism and was short by about 6"" so there would be nothing to ""trim"" per the instructions. I started in the middle and working toward each end in disregard to the instructions. I was able to stretch the gasket to just reach the edge of the door opening. Possibly because I had brought #8 stainless steel screws and washers, instead of the narrow galvanized nails and washers provided, I did not have the material tear when stretched out as far as possible.

With the middle and end secured I worked from the center out on each end to complete the installation. I spaced fasteners at 13""(+/-) on center between two fasteners placed at each end 1"" and another 4"" from the end. No telling what the manufacture has in mind for fastener spacing.",1.0

This is a super book light!  Bought two of these to replace two we had misplaced.  Excellent brightness--sort of glad we lost the others!,5.0
Very bright but it's good.,5.0
"Daughter uses it nightly. We both love it, much better than reading in the dark and has brightness settings.",5.0
"Got this for my husband as a birthday gift, and he's used it every night since. It seems very well made, and the batteries seem to be lasting for a pretty long time. It's not very heavy, but still feels fairly solid. The clamp is padded on both sides, so it won't mar your book pages. The light has 2 LEDs for brightness control - press the button once to turn it on with both LEDs, press it again to dim the light by having only one LED on, and then press it a third time to turn it off completely.
I may have to invest in one of these for myself, after seeing how nice it is.",5.0
"This is a great light! It's very bright (high, low and off settings) and I like that the gooseneck will bend 360 degrees but is not at all flimsy. It works well on both hardbound and paperback books. I don't usually write reviews, but this is worth one.",5.0
"Bought this for my daughter to take to camp and she loved it! It takes 3 AAA batteries, which are included. When I packed it for camp I turned one of the batteries around so it wouldn't accidentally turn on and run down. She used it at camp nightly for 2 weeks and it never went dim.

She loved the flexible neck so she could position it exactly as she needed. The light was a nice bright white, making it easy to see the print on the page. The clip was sturdy and stayed in place on the book.

She also use it for her tablet to give her some extra light and it clips on easy and doesn't interfere with anything she's doing. And because it's lightweight it's still comfortable whether she's using it on her book or tablet.

Since she didn't have a side table light at camp she used it kind of as a regular lamp, too. It wasn't very bright but just enough for what she needed. It was also better than her flashlight at times because she could clip it to herself and be hands-free. A multi-tasker!

Over the past 25 years I've gone through many iterations of the book light and this is the best so far. And to add it it's great features is the ability to buy it in a variety of fun colors. Finally a book light that works that's not black (unless that's what you want!)",5.0
But allows for two settings. My other light was too dim; would love a light that's in between.,5.0
"Great reading light.  This is the 3rd one I own: I keep one at bedside for reading at night (so I don't disturb hubby with a brighter bedside lamp), one in my suitcase so it's ready for travel, and one in the guest bedroom.  Good lighting, batteries last a long time and can also  it serves as an emergency light if you ever need one due to a power outage - either at home or while traveling.",5.0
It's perfect the light is just enough for book reading at night and does not disturb my husband sleeping,5.0
I love being able to have the option to use an ac adapter with this booklight!  The two light settings are also a nice feature.,5.0
great for what its supposed to be for.,5.0

The base is a little thick but otherwise really pleased with this.,5.0

Perfect for Bookworms</a>&nbsp;to compare them -- the product listings look so similar, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to have one as a backup.

Well it turns out this Mighty Bright is way better. They're the same brightness and the same form factor, but the LuminoLight doesn't cast an even light -- it's strong in the center and fades quickly to the edges. While this Mighty Bright is even all around. And that really makes a huge difference -- much easier to read on the page.

(Besides that, the LuminoLight is made of a glossy plastic that feels a bit cheaper, whereas this Mighty Bright is a matte plastic that feels and looks a bit nicer.)",5.0
"I use this on my antique book stand which holds a very large reference book.
It works well.  I love it.",5.0
This little device keeps my marriage running. When I want to read and she wants to sleep it is the perfect tool. Shines bright in a small area and easy on batteries.,5.0
my boyfriend got this light for me since our sleep schedules are a little staggered. he almost always falls asleep before and is sensitive to light. this does a great job of keeping the surrounding dark and my book illuminated. the quality of the light is great and lasts long,5.0
"This light works well. It stays clipped on with not trouble, gives a lot of light without disturbing my husband and has 2 light settings. I love it for times when I am reading a real book as opposed to my Kindle.",5.0
"Might Bright is very good as both a book light and kindle light.

Its most promising feature is the evenly spread out white light and I can certainly attest to that. It doesnt have that blue tint like some LEDs and 2 brightness modes means that there is always enough light to complete your work comfortably.

It is very much multipurpose in nature - I also use it to illuminate my laptop setup (includes external keyboard) during light and it hardly creates any glare on the shiny plastic surface. Even when there is some light in the room, sometimes I use it to illuminate my book pages if it looks too dull (in terms of brightness).

The battery is quite good, but not exceptional - I have used it for a week roughly, and kept it on for a long time even when my studies were completed. Finally, one night I noticed that it was too dim and replaced the batteries - which is when I understood how dim it became in the last days. So, my guess is that it is probably good for 4-5 days if you use it extensively. I bought 4 rechargeable AAA batteries with this, which I would recommend doing as it will probably become a costly affair to replace the batteries so often.

I usually don't rate anything 5 star unless it is really really good compared to the competition.",5.0
Perfect for saving electricity and a book lover.,5.0
I have never had a book light before and came across this one. This is amazing. It gives the ability to adjust the position of the light giving you the best angle. The light is perfect for any type of book. It Is led and the lights do not produce a circle like most books lights do. For the price it is a great light.,5.0
"I really love this, enough light for you to read by, but not enough to wake up anyone else",5.0
This little light is fantastic. After researching a lot of reading lights I often read that some were too bright. This one illuminates my book pages perfectly without throwing extra light into my sleeping husbands eyes. He is able to fall asleep quickly while I continue to read. I'm so glad I found this because my other option was to stay in the living room alone at night.,5.0
fantastic light worth every cent,5.0
"I love this light! It is very lightweight, the clamp definitely opens an inch. The light easily illuminates two pages of a book with no hot spots, and the flexible neck is never in the way-- so you don't have to adjust it when you are using it. It can also stand on its own, without having to clamp on to anything. There are two bulbs; you can have both on or just one. The light is a nice white color.",5.0
Met all of my expectations!,5.0

"This little light of mine... It's wonderful, exactly what I needed for reading in bed. It clips to the book nice. But what I do is stack pillows behind me and I clip it to the bunched up material on one of the pillows and the light shines over my shoulder. I store it by clipping it to my curtain right behind the headboard. It could also be used while clipped to the curtains, the 2 brightness settings are good as well. Very happy with this product and would by again, in fact I am going to buy one as a gift for my mom who loves to read in bed!",5.0

Now I can sing a lot better while following the words.  Also, a real plus, this is so helpful when I do my counted cross stitching, yes I can do this very well.  I've been told that I am amazing.

"This little guy is just what I needed for my late night reading. My light switch is ALL the way on the other side of my room and once I get all cozy in bed I do not want to get up and turn the light on and off.

The light clamps onto any thing you want it to or you can clamp it to your book. The light has 3 modes: on bright, on less bright, and off. Simply uses a AA battery and is not super distracting for other people that may be trying to sleep in the same room. The light is very portable and light weight. A great tool for any avid reader!",5.0
"I bought this to clip to my newborns diaper changing station so I could change her diaper in the middle of the night without turning on the lights. This gave me enough light to see but not overly bright, worked perfect for what I needed",5.0

This was a gift for my avid reader child. It is a great book light. Far better than the book lights when I was a kid!! It bright enough to illuminate the entire book but does not hurt the eyes in a dim/dark room. It has two settings depending on how much light you need. It clips on easily and the flexible head is easily adjusted.,5.0
Great for what I use it for - a light for my laptop and a reading light in a bedroom.,5.0
Bright and kind of Bright setting. Wish it was a little dimmer but eye adjust quick. Have been using for an hour-three hours every night and still on original battery (3 months).,5.0

"Wow, what an improvement over the one I had, and it takes regular batteries. Really make my evening reading a pleasure.",5.0
My husband loves to read in bed and he doesn't have a nightstand for a lamp. So I was looking for something portable but effective for him to read in bed still while I can catch some Zzzs. This thing does an excellent job and the clip is good for holding the pages. There are two light intensity settings and the lowest setting is enough. He's happy with it.,5.0

"Great Product. I have had one like this for over ten years.  Finally decided another one would be handy.  :-)  The booklight is flexible, but not ""floppy""  You set the light to the angle you want, and it stays at that angle!",5.0
"Bought this for my kiddo- perfect fit.
My 9 year old likes to read.  The first reading light I bought didn't have a timer or auto-off, which meant we burned through a battery's charge pretty quickly.  This unit has an elongated oval button.  One side works like a traditional on/off and the other side of the button is for the timer.  Each click of the timer side adds 15 minutes of light, up to 4 clicks for an hour.  Each click is shown as a small red led light on the top of the light.  Works like a charm and has been relatively durable.  My kid has knocked this light from the top of his loft multiple times.  The only noticeable effect has been the clear plastic cover popping off.
This was the reading light I wish I had purchased this first time.  I bought the silver one, which is much much cheaper than the other color options available.

"Bought this for my husband who a) loves to read at 3 am when he wakes up stressed about work yet knows he can't turn the light on, and b) he's on an LED kick lately, so all new lights must be powered by LED bulbs.
Clearly, a win-win for him and for me. The adjustable capability allows him to switch to a lower output (nice for me), and it's small, lightweight, and the clamp-on system works perfectly.",5.0
"So far so good with this little light.  I love to read in bed at night, but it's difficult to do that when my husband just wants to sleep!  This little light is plenty bright, and I can aim the light right where I want it, so it doesn't light up the entire room.  It was shipped with batteries, so it was nice that I didn't have to search for them before use.  The only (slight) complaint I have is the bulkiness of the 'clip' end.  It's a little large / heavy, but given that this is battery-powered, I don't know how else it could be designed to be smaller.  Love this little light!",5.0

"it clips on to most anything and holds light in place. It is very adjustable. I really love it for late night crocheting and needlepointing. I am confined to bed and have poor vision.

I am in a hospital bed. (in our home)",5.0

"I got this for my 7 year old who loves reading in bed. He uses his overhead light & nightstand but still does not have sufficient lighting. This uses LED lights, came with batteries & provides him with the lighting he needs. It casts over both pages of his book evenly. He can attach it to his head board or the book he's reading (it's notably much easier with hard cover books). Overall this is a great light, now I'll have to buy one for myself!",5.0
Wife loves to read in bed and this works great.,5.0
Just what I needed for reading in bed at night!,5.0
"Perfect little book light, for my purposes anyway.  I love the way it has two light levels and covers both pages of an open book.  The clip works easily, even on paperbacks although I recommend using a clipboard to hold soft paperbacks.  With a hardcover you can just clip it to the back cover.  I have had other book lights but this is my favorite so far.",5.0
"I bought this for 3 1/2 year old son and it works perfectly! It provides sufficient light so that he can comfortably read before falling asleep (he had previously been using a flashlight!) and I love that it has an automatic adjustable timer on it so when the light goes off, my son knows it's time to put his book down and go to sleep. It clips securely to his head board so that it's out of the way and he never has to touch it but the bendable neck allows me to position it as needed so the light shines down perfectly on his book.",5.0
"I've been using this for nearly 2 years for paperback, hardcover, and Kindle classic (unlit) reading almost every single day. I also use it for extra light while I am crocheting. It has not let me down once.
The most common reasons I've been disappointed with other book lights I've used: The LEDs die way too early, the batteries die too quickly, and usually, the neck isn't bendy enough for the perfect fit (or it just breaks from being moved too often). This hasn't had any of those problems.

- Bright, with two brightness level options
- Light is enough for a large book

- Can sit free-standing on a flat surface without being clipped
- Neck is super adjustable, doesn't lose flexibility over time
- Neck is relatively long
- Can open clip pretty wide for large books and tables/desks/etc
- Clip is padded so it won't damage anything
- Relatively lightweight (batteries are heaviest part)

- Battery life is good, better than most
- Can buy an optional AC adapter for it to use without batteries!

- Long-lasting quality, at least for the two years I've been using it so far... I'll update when something finally goes wrong ;)

- Overall, really happy with it and I recommend the brand to anyone who asks.",5.0

"Just what I needed for a book light.  I tend to wind down at night reading OLD books that I don't want to clip something onto and weaken the binding, and this one will clip onto my bed covers, and the flexible neck lets me just point it at my book like a little lamp.  While the blue casing lights up, it isn't enough to be annoying or distracting.  I've been through several books with it, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet either.",5.0
Excellent!,5.0
"Love this thing, I stay up late reading all the time now and can get much more done when I need to cram for homework assignments. The double settings make sure that I don't hurt my eyes with overbrightness, or wake my sleeping wife next to me. And at other times the brighter setting helps when I need that much more light for the specific book that doesn't have the whitest of pages. Its battery life seems to last really well and not suck through batteries which is great.",5.0

"(And the price keeps dropping! Other colors are cheaper here on Amazon, take a look!)  How can I say it.... I've fallen in love with a tiny spark of LED brightness! My Mighty Bright has kept me company for several hours a week during the dark, chilly winter, while I wait in the van for my kid's after-school activities to be done. I use it for reading and drawing (haven't tried hand-stitching yet but I'm sure it will work for that, too). For reading, I don't clip it on the book itself but instead onto the cup holder, then straighten the neck up to full height and bend the light over the book. That way I can turn the pages, set the book down, eat, drink, move around, use my cellphone, all without having to mess with the light. For drawing, I use a clipboard anyway so my Mighty Bright grabs the clipboard edge nicely, like it was made to do that. The first time I tried it and I saw how well it lit up the whole surface of a 9x12 inch pad, I almost cried! It's a cinch to reposition, providing near-infinite flexibility for every possible angle. The gooseneck is thin yet quite sturdy, well-attached to the base and the head, with a smooth metallic feel. I wasn't sure a single brightness setting was going to work for me, so I was delighted when the LEDs turned out to have the perfect hue /tone and perfect brightness for my tasks. Having won my heart with its awesome performance, my Mighty Bright stays in the van in its own special place in the overhead console, safe from being yanked on, smashed, twisted, stomped or tangled up in backpacks and headphone cords.

But here, in my opinion, is the main reason I wanted to write this review, and to me, the real test of whether a book light is a good investment:  Once it's set up and I get started drawing, or I get into my book, I forget all about the light itself. The Mighty Bright becomes unnoticeable; it blends into the background, doing its job in the most unobtrusive, intuitive, and efficient manner of any device I've ever owned. So far no battery change has been needed and I've used it 10+ hours. I am ravishingly happy with this little thing and intend to use mine forever and give them as gifts. They are *that* good.",5.0
Use to read research articles after hubby goes to sleep. Works great. Stays in place,5.0
Very nice quality. Like that it has two settings .,5.0
Great little night light. I use it all the time. Not just for reading but to illuminate the bedroom in the evening without disturbing others. It is so light and portable that I can carry it as I walk from with me from room to room if I need to without turning on overhead lights.  Highly recommended. Thank you.,5.0
"This light does everything I had hoped plus....
sturdy base....excellent light expanse...actually uses regular AAA batteries...holds in place yet flexes easily...

"Compact......good lighting....easy to use.  I can now read at night in bed w/o bothering my spouse.  Convenient.......batteries comes with unit.
The neck is also very flexible and clip will secure even on a magazine.  Light is very good and will illuminate an entire book, magazine, or Ipad.",5.0

Use it quite ofter and batteries seem to last forever.  A bit of a harsh light. Would buy it again.,5.0
"I bought three of these in blue (a spare for me and one for my brother) after thoroughly reading all of the comments on competitive brands. I found the comments praising this model to be right on the mark. When I read it lit up both pages at the same time using dual lights where all other brands required constant repositioning for each page, that was all I needed to know this was the best reading light for me.

I can't say enough nice things about this product. It has dual lights on a flex shaft which you can position to fully illuminate both pages of a large hardback book. You won't need to keep moving the light around to light your pages with this one and the pages ar well lit for easy reading in the dark. But the light is centralized on the book and not the surrounding area so others can sleep while you read.

You can also switch from dual lights to a single light. The flexible shaft on the light is sturdy and stable enough to firmly hold its position over the book even while you move around and turn pages. You can either clip it on the cover or use the clip to hold open the pages. It operates on AAA batteries. The higher quality battery, the longer it lasts. I use the Duracell ultra digital batteries with the blue band.

I cannot think of any negatives about this product. I'm not associated with any seller. I am just a customer who was happy to find a great product. Definitely a good buy.",5.0
Got this to replace an old broken book light.  Have had it for several months and after heavy usage am just now replacing the batteries.  For light readers I would expect the batteries to last even longer.,5.0

Purchased this book light for my daughter and she loves it ! This book light is bright but is easy on your eyes. You can click it on your book  If you're sitting at a table or desk you can stand it alone like a miniature desk lamp it projects the right amount of reading light .,5.0
worked great and clips easily on hard cover or paperback books,5.0
I love this item.  My previous book light did not emit as much light as this one.  I also like the two levels of lighting.,5.0
"This is a great little book light. Plenty bright, with the option of two different levels of brightness. The snake-like cord makes it easy to read even lying down in bed. It's perfect for my 7-year-old who likes to read in bed. She can even clip it onto her teddy bear's hand and adjust it to read her book. Love this book light!",5.0
I like that it has two brightness settings. Good quality.,5.0
Awesome book light. Wife uses it on the regular. It came with batteries and has variable settings. The dim setting is perfect for night reading and it has a nice long flexible arm. The clip distributes the pressure nicely without clipping too hard on the book. It's honestly awesome.,5.0
"Very good book light. I enjoy that with it's size and flexibility, it often doubles as a convenient flashlight around our room as well. Will purchase again.",5.0
"These are great! Two brightness settings that are just right. The clamp is strong so the light stays put on your book. The neck is sturdy but flexible, and easy to adjust. We bought these for our kids, and I'm going to get myself one now! Best book light I've ever used!",5.0
"Love this book light, I use it all the time. It is lightweight and easily clips to any book or magazine.",5.0
Love these things and have them in almost every room in our house. Perfect for road trips or when my husband is trying to sleep and I am still reading or working on homework in bed.,5.0

"Great light, every member in my family ended up getting one after seeing mine",5.0
"My father loves to read at night and this was exactly what he needed to be able to continue reading late at night without disturbing my mother, therefore making it the perfect gift!",5.0
"Does the job - and without any other lights on, using this makes you feel sort of like you're camping in a tent with a flashlight!  Sturdily made, and the clip hangs on to books just great.  As long as you treat it with relative care and don't step on it, it should last a good long time.

Just wish that the light was warm rather than the cold/blueish LED stuff.",5.0
"LOVE! I bought 2 of these lights for my daughter's to use at night while reading in bed. These little Mighty Brights throw off plenty of light to read by. I could see this being useful on an airplane or a long train/bus ride. It's small enough to slip into a book bag/back pack. My kids have been using them for about 6 months (off and on) and I still haven't needed to change the battery (I actually don't know how many batteries this takes. lol)
I gave these lights to my kids at Christmas. I think they are a great gift idea to any avid reader!",5.0
"after reading the reviews for this sander i bought one and have a few comments. first the good, it's quiet and easy on the hands, that's all. the bad is the pad is so soft that sanding out saw marks, planer nicks ect. is about impossible, the pad is for sheet paper or psa paper, be aware that if you use psa paper like i do if you are not really careful the covering on the pad will tear and you will be buying a new pad. i also bought porter cable psa paper for this sander, it's ok but if you are going to radius a square edge the paper just rips and is useless, and forget about sanding the edge of a board, the pad is so soft you will not have a square edge when you are done. i talked to porter cable about this and there is no hard pad for this sander. if you want a sander for sanding between coats of varnish on a flat surface this may be your sander, otherwise if you plan on sanding the edges of that new dovetail box you made, forget it. i am going to try to make my own pad and if that is not possible i am going to sell it at the next garage sale. i've been a woodworker for 40 years and will be using my old dewalt random orbit with a hard pad and psa paper until i can find something better.",1.0
"This is one of the best guides I have owned. Perhaps its unfair giving this low a rating; but, I would never use it without the router it fits on. I do a lot of normal and advanced router work. When I saw this jig and envisioned easy adjustments I ordered it right away.

I never use it.

I have several Porter-Cable routers that this guide will fit. The problem is that it mounts with the handles in the wrong orientation to the way you work. It is the routers problem.
With the guide mounted on the router the handle orientation is wrong (at least to my way of working). I have other routers and guides which present the handles in the way I usually hold them while working. I think Proter-Cable made a major design flaw which they never addressed. Beware.",1.0

PROS.
1.  Liked the speed settings.
2.  When it ran, it ran very quietly, very low noise.
3.  Makes a great $214 paperweight, just be sure to dust it  every so often, since it tends to gathers dust. Cons: l.  Difficult to make height adjustments.  2.  On/Off Switches make it difficult to turn on and off.  Plunge mechanism slips and is awkward to use. Makes a great paperweight.",1.0
"This router is a piece of [poor workmanship].  You can take my word for it or waste your money.  First off, the brake stopped working almost immediately.  The clear plastic chip deflector does not fit and is worthless.  The depth rod locking knob stripped rendering the depth rod useless.  The micro plunge locking mechanism does not stay disingaged making it a major hassle to use micro plunge adjustment knob.  Also, it is very difficult turning the micro plunge knob to raise the router - It takes quite a bit of muscle.  When plunging, the router has a lot of play.  A small amount is understandable, but this router has way too much play.  The plunge itself is not smooth - Its jerky making it difficult to make smooth plunges.  And if you can put up with all of these problems, there is the problem of power.  This router simply keeps bogging down and at times will completely stop.  I can not use this router any more.  It has ruined my last project and unless I can get it fixed under warranty, I will have to buy a new one.  I own a lot of tools and this router is by far the worst investment I have ever made.  Take my advise and stay away.  Buy the Dewalt, Makita, or Bosch.  The Dewalt 621 in particular is a very fine router.  If still want to buy this router, I would be happy to sell you mine real cheap.",1.0
"This is the worst tool that I have used from Porter Cable.  I have tried to fix a depth and it would not stay where I wanted the depth of cut.  This is really a problem when using your Leigh Dovetail Jig or a router table.  There are two mistakes in the users manual that I told Porter Cable reps about a year ago and they are still there when I called them about two weeks ago.
I only have one good thing to say about this router it is very quiet.",1.0
"This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment. It feels good in your hand,although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch,which means that you don't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that. The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch,but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes. I tried to use it longer, thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that,but that is not the case ,it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter. It would be good for frying eggs,and making coffee.",1.0
I used the flashlight 3 times. The bulb burn out and the replacement also fail. I smell burning material . should I contact dewalk for replacement,1.0
"This kit came with seven different sized guides and two threaded rings to attach the guides to the router's base plate. The guides seem to be sized correctly but the general quality of the guides is rather poor. The pieces are advertised as ""MACHINED"", but are obviously NOT machined as the threads on all the pieces are showing signs of either casting or stamping. While the locking nuts DID thread onto each guide easily, it was discerning to see something with PORTER CABLE'S name on it with such obvious flaws. (...)",1.0
"I purchased this product, specifically, to use with the Leigh D4 Dovetail Jig because I wanted to use half-inch router bits to cut the pins and tails in a through-dovetail operation.  When doing this the end of the board to be routed rests at a 90-degree angle against the underside of the dovetail jig.  What I discovered is that the templete guides are too long for this operation -- they descend lower than the dovetail jig fingers.  Of course, the board can be lowered to accomodate for the difference, but then there is no support for the finger assembly, resulting in unevenly-cut dovetails.  This set of template guides is not the answer if you are looking to route dovetails using the Leigh D4 Dovetail Jig.  You will want to find template guides that complement the jig without having to make unneeded adjustments.
This is in no way meant to criticize this product for normal routing operations.  Again, I purchased this product for a very specific task and subsequently found that it was not the right tool for that task.",1.0
"Router seemed to have problems out of the box maintaining speed. I would describe it as hunting for the proper RPM. Being as this is my first router which has a load sensing feature, I wasn't sure what to expect. I am not impressed. I wound up setting the variable speed faster than the bit recommended to finish the project. It has now degraded to no variable function, no load sensing, and slow to start. This router has less than 1 running hour on it. I will update how Porter Cable intends to handle this warranty item.
Update: I shipped the router to an authorized service center on my own dime. They replaced the speed controller and it worked fine for another hour or so of light operation. It has failed again. My one star review remains.",1.0

"I just have no idea what all the rave is about.  This has been one of the worst tool purchases I've ever made...

First off - I like P/C tools.  I've got 4 routers, dovetail jig, 2 pneumatic nailers, 2 sanders, etc. and am happy with all.  I wanted a small, lightweight, precision circ saw for clean x-cutting cabinet sheet goods.  I'm using the Freud thin kerf blade...

Pros:  nice light weight, and feels really well-balanced.  You could wield this all day.  Sightlines are OK.  Quieter than a full-size circ saw.  Minimal torque at trigger startup (helps to keep blade from moving uncontrollably when starting saw from mid-cut)...

Cons:  extremely under-powered - even with a new Freud blade, it takes a good 30+ sec or so to cross cut a 3/4"" sheet of plywood.  Go too fast and you can stop the blade.  This is the kind of torque you get from worm-drive?  Also, the base is nearly worthless - absolute piece of crap.  Bent steel that can be easily warped with moderate hand pressure.  2x6 tipped over and fell onto the saw - bent the base virtually beyond repair.  Was never flat.  Bevel adjustment is virtually impossible to set precisely.  Arbor was not perpendicular to the guide edge.  And, NO aftermarket upgrades are available...

I wish somebody would make a trim saw that was truly rugged AND precise.  The 314 DEFINITELY doesn't fit the bill.  I've owned it for 2 years now, using it occasionally for light remodeling and furniture construction and have been very disappointed.  I would not recommend this tool - especially for jobsite conditions...",1.0
"I don't know who is reviewing this saw but I make my living with these tools and I purchased 2 of these based on Porter Cables reputation to replace my Makita trim saws. I live in New Jersey and these saws are filled with gear oil which in the winter means unless you heat them up, they burn themselves up trying to turn the gear oil in the cold weather. After I realized this I put light weight oil in the other one which helped but it still burnt up with a fine cut high tooth count blade due to low motor power. I don't need a trim saw to turn a rough cut rip blade, I need it to turn a trim blade which this one does not! 2 burnt up saws = bad review!",1.0

"As soon as the Model 314 trim saw arrived, I went through the short-on-information manual, and looked the tool over.

When I tried to set the depth of cut to less than 3/4"", the inner guard contacted the blade.

I went over the manual again and again (I even read the Spanish and German!), but could not figure out a way to make this contraption work.

The guard is riveted to the bed of the saw, and therefore must move with the bed.

Since the radius of the guard  matches the radius of the blade, it stands to reason that when the depth of cut is adjusted, the alignment of the axes of the blade and the guard will change and at some point the blade will contact the guard.

Is this a recent modification, or has this saw always been ill-conceived?

Porter-Cable isn't saying.

They told me to take it to one of their service centers. Not bloody likely.

Amazon came through by making it easy to return this unused tool.",1.0
"I have 35 routers. I owned and regulary used 7 Porter Cable routers, including 3ea. 7518s. All of the Porter Cable routers created a chattered result. The collet run-out vibration sometimes caused bits to loosen in the collet while routing. The motor arbors were fine, but all 7ea. 1/2"" collets averaged .007"" run-out at the top of a 1 1/2 double flutted bit. The bit was turned 180 dgrees and the collets retested at 180 dregrees, but the run-out remained the same. The worst had .015"" run-out, so it was thown out. It's a shame the collets were so short and gripped bits so poorly. I'll be replacing them all.",1.0
"The dust collection doesn't work. Take the side cover off and see for yuorself, Porter Cable blocked the rear dust collection port with a strip of metal. They put the port onthe top which is useless. Remove the strip and the fanand use a vacuum or buy a different sander.",1.0
"I have a cabinet shop with 17 employees. This belt sanders quality has gone down to near 0, much like most of Porter Cable's tools have over the past few years. We once used mostly Porter Cable portable tools in the shop, and they lasted well and worked well, I think I even have a couple old Rockwell sanders in the shop that still work (before Porter Cable took them over many years ago) . I could not really guess how many 360 sanders I have bought over the years, but NO MORE, there quality is just gone and they don't last anymore. We went to Bosch sanders quite a few years ago, and they were a very well built sander that was balanced similar to Porter Cable, but they quit making them a few years ago for some reason, so now its Makita or Porter Cable only it seems for a 3x24 sander. Makita seem to last well and work well, but after using porter Cable and Bosch it seems the balance is different, and takes awhile to get used to them, but they are a far better sander than Porter Cable.

first of this thing is all Plastic!!! second thing is balnce is weird and hard to get used to  but the saw hook is a plus the main reason i rated this saw bad was it got droped off a plank that was no higher than five feet and craked in two and it wasn't even a week old so i geuss i will stay with a mag for now one star for the hook,1.0
"i bought this saw because dewalt rep. came by the job site and showed it to my crew . i liked the facted that it was light it had built on skyhook it beveled up to 50 deg.i liked that it had more power than the skil.it felt different than the skil but i got used to it.my first week using it i found out that with rip fence that cost more than the skil rip fence , you could not use it while you were in bevel more than 18 deg. the knob for rip fence was to big and bulky and was on left side of table .skil is on the right side of table and you can max 45 deg bevel with fence .the saw was so powerful the gears could not take it and failed under warranty so i had it fixed and it failed again rather than keep making trips back to get it repaired i dumped it in trash i bought it for second saw so i still had my model 77 skil and bought a mag for second saw i do own a lot of dewalt tools but i will not buy the dw 378g again if they fixed the problems with it they will have to give me one before i would use it again",1.0

I have since purchased the new Hitachi 12"" and the difference is incredible.  I really thought the Hitachi would be similar to the Dewalt since they both are 12"" models, but I wanted to try it out anyway.

"I purchased this saw expecting it to replace my radial arm saw.  I discovered a manufacturing defect after using the saw.  The sliding rails are not aligned with the saw blade.  Whenever, I used the slide feature for boards wider than 4"", I'd get chipout and/or burned edges on the wood. I reported the problem to DeWAlt and they suggested that I take the saw to one of their authorized repair centers for evaluation.  After 3 weeks and 3 trips to the repair center they decided there was no way to adjust for this problem.  The manager said he would recomend to DeWalt that it was a manufacturing defect because the yoke was machined inproperly and see if they would pay to repair the defect.  Guess what?  Not a word from the repair center or from DeWalt.  I'll never again buy anything with the DeWalt name on it and if you are considering this saw look further. If you are gong to use this saw for anythig other than cutting 2x4 for home construction you won't be happy with this saw.",1.0
Amzn shipping took way too long for me to give this product a positive review- I recommend purchasing elsewhere.  Many eBay sites ship same-day.,1.0
"My rating is a resounding thumbs down.

The first problem is the power on-off button is reversed. My router operates with the power button on the off position.  This machine obviously never went though a quality inspection at the factory.

The second problem is the router continually locks the bits in the collet.  I tried every lubricant imaginable without success.  Once the bit is locked in, plan on keeping it in place for a while, a very long while.  I have been forced to use pliers to pry the bits out. The freezing complaint is repeated numerous times by other users.  I incorrectly assumed Porter Cable (PC) would have resolved this by the time of my purchase.

I must be missing something here.  For the $160 price the PC 310 cost, you can buy the PC 690LR ($125) with more power and still get some router bits for less.  The PC 310 is a dinosaur doomed to extinction.  We can only hope PC either re-engineers this product or stops production before it further tarnishes its reputation.",1.0
"I see a lot of reviews that owners are bragging because they are trying to justify the price they just paid for this saw.  In terms of overall value (actual benefits and quality versus price) I give it a 1.
I have been a DeWalt fan for a long time but their motto ""Own the User"" isn't backed up by this tool or their poor customer service.
Read the reviews and look at the problems, they are for real.
1. Highest price with fewest accessories. C'mon, DeWalt, even your cheaper saws have an extension. Stops and hold downs would be nice (cheaper that the other tools that you throw in for promos).
2. Base quality issues.  I have read complaints about the base not being flat.  I haven't checked mine yet for flatness, but I can believe it.  Mine had so much casting slag that needed to be trimmed that I believe the other reports of base problems.  It took an hour with a die grinder to trim all of the burrs on the casting.  For $600 you'd figure that DeWalt would hire someone on the line to deburr their products.
3. Tool quality is the most important issue when purchasing items of this price.  Second comes customer service.  Read the reviews, DeWalt's customer service does not back up their motto ""Own the User"".  Their customer service is just flat poor!  They put the wrong blade on the saw and won't exchange it.  They had a promo and won't back it up.  All big tools have pluses and minuses but customer service can overcome some of the problems and really let a company shine.  DeWalt, you missed the boat on this one!
For a company that spends so much on brand image advertising, they drop you like a hot potato after you purchased their tool.  I plan on returning this saw and getting the Makita.  It's the same price, customer service seems to be better, and they have a great promo going on now (Buy the saw - get a cordless impact.  Also, enter the sweepstakes for a new truck).
While it looks nice, I will be putting less yellow and black in the shop.",1.0
The shipping was as much or more than the product. I ordered it with other dewalt products but it is shipped from a seperaye company,1.0
I couldn't get the saw to cut square.  If I got a 45 degree on the right to cut it would be off on the left.  I couldn't fine tune it because it would fall into the postive stops and not allow me to adjust a quarter degree one way or another.  There were some good things but I had to take it back because after several hours of adjusting it didn't suit me.  Due to DeWalt's excellent return policy it was no problem to take it back after 3 weeks.,1.0

"Like so many others, I went with this Dewalt light because it uses the same 18v battery as my other cordless tools. Like so many others, I am very disappointed with these lights. I also own the DW908 and hate that thing too because you can never get the beam aimed where you want it. My buddy sprayed brake cleaner on that one to clean it off and the cheap plastic fused the power switch to the casing so it's toast. The DW919 is a whole other mess of poor design and even poorer usability. The head is too heavy for the flexible neck so its always toppling over or moving out of position. You have to constantly move the head back and forth to position the beam. The beam is very weak and dim even on a fully charged battery. After it moved for the hundredth time while working on a brake job, I threw it out of the way and the flexible neck broke where it attaches to the head. Good riddance to this piece of junk. I love my other Dewalt tools but I'm going with another brand for my work lighting.",1.0
"I am a big Dewalt fan - I must have a dozen or more battery powered tools (drills, circular saw and reciprocating saw) as well as several plug in tools (grinder and plate joiner) and like them very much.  I bought this particular light with an 18v package a number of years ago and have never been able to make any use of it.  What prompted this review was an attempt just now to use it to shine up from the floor of my woodshop on the underside of my table saw fence rail (installing a Wixey digital readout).  In the first place, the light it produces is very poor, particularly considering the fact that it runs on 18v.  It uses and old fashioned incandescent bulb.  Second, it won't shine up from the floor or from any other useable position except straight ahead when resting on a flat surface.  The goose neck is too long and won't support the light head in any useable light position when extended.  It constantly falls over. Several months ago, I bought a Starsea led work light from Amazon.  I paid about $20 for it and have found it extremely useful.  They are now about $13 according to the website.  It is much more versatile and produced a tremendous amount of LED light -
and it is battery powered.  Personally, I think this Dewalt light is not worth the money even if you have 18v batteries - which are becoming extinct  due to the advent and popularity of lithium ion batteries.",1.0

"I've seen some off-shore poor-quality product sold by Delta in the past - I know it's what you need to do to compete in this market, but this out-feed table is the worst.  Besides the enormous amount of time that it takes to install, adjust, re-adjust etc, the quality of the table and laminate is garbage.  The shipping from Amazon left minor damage around the edges.  Laminate peeling, cracked, etc - but parts missing is no excuse.  I knew that my options were to return it or exchange from Amazon, so I decided to call Delta directly who told me it would be several months until the new part was released and on top of all that - I had to pay for it.  When they sent me to the warranty call center, they simply sent me back to the general info number.  I can now see that Delta is no different than any of the off-shore clone woodworking products that are out there.  You are for sure better off building your own in this case.  It's not close to the quality of the machine that it couples up with, in my case an older Unisaw.  Sorry Delta!",1.0

Unfortunately, out of the 100 or so small driver sockets I have, none seem to fit the base to even get the job started without it being a major headache.

"Right now I am giving it one star. It arrived today with the rods sticking out of the manufacturer's box. There were gaps and holes in the box. It would have been a better idea to have put it into an Amazon box. I have a DeWalt 618. When I started to put the 10 mm rods into the edge guide, only one rod would go through the opening of the die cast. The other opening was defective, thus the rod could not pass thru. I thought of filing it, but the defect was significant. Don't they have quality control at Dewalt?
Generally I like Dewalt products, so I am returning this one and ordering a replacement. If the replacement is okay and works well, I will have something positive to add and change the rating. However, right now I am very disappointed with Amazon in regards to the packaging of the item, and especially with Dewalt for not having quality control in detecting a defective product.",1.0

"While the parallel arm concept on the Dewalt is unique and got great reviews at the time I bought mine, it is a flawed system. I was constantly breaking blades which often stabbed and gouged my work piece and once, my hand. Worse yet, the top arm tip, which secures the blade, is made from cast aluminum. After yet another broken blade, the casting shattered thereby making the saw inoperable. When I went to buy a replacement part, no local store selling the Dewalt saw would help me, referring me to Dewalt itself. The Dewalt website did not list any replacement parts for the arm tip. I couldn't get through to human on their phone system. I ended up putting the entire thing on the curb for the scrap metal collectors.",1.0
The guide comes with two sets of rods to accommodate various DeWalt routers' rod spacings and rod diameters. The thicker rods could not insert into the guide. Obviously this was not checked at the factory. The brass screws that hold the rods in the guide would not retract enough to give clearance for the rods. Rendering the guide useless.

"I purchased the DeWalt DW7080 Extension System for my new DeWalt 706 Dual Compound Miter Saw.  While I was very impressed with the tolerances and quality of the 706, the extension system will not work properly.  The 7080 system is made for the 708 saw but DeWalt said in their product brochure and on this site that it is the right one for the 706.  This is incorrect, as the extension system will not store under the saw.  It seems the saw lacks the proper clearance under the saw table to store the system. The base casting needs to be modified by DeWalt to make this work. This means that every time you use the system, you must take it on and off and store it somewhere. I called DeWalt and after some research they agreed with me.  In my opinion, based on the lack of ajustability for short stock, this makes the extension system worthless and diminishes the Model 706 saw.",1.0

I know that I can shim the extension plate a 1/2"" to make it level, but I feel for a $ 350.00 mitre saw I shouldn't have to do that.

Today when I adjusted the depth and pressed the handle down I heard another ""pop"".  This time the fix did not work.  I wound up removing the handle and shaft and putting an aircraft nut on the machine screw that locks the depth of cut into place.

Very bad design from Dewalt. I liked my miter-saw until I saw this ""design-flaw"". This accessory piece is also a pain to assemble and if one plans to remove it to save space or to carry the saw around, has to be sure to have a wrench to loose the locknuts.

"Looks and feels great, out of the box.....but, when installing on my DW713 the nightmare began.  Mounting is very sloppy, and impossible to level with the saw base.

I suggest you find another support system or saw.

Added Comment....I found a second hole on my saw base.  It wasn't indicated in the instructions, but looked like it could help the situation.  This hole needed a special size hex head screw (I found at home Depot) it did the trick.  I now have my extension mounted solidly, and functional.  I still won't change my rating or previous comments, because DeWalt failed in its' instruction and their support help.

Nice item to have on your saw.  I don't think I can live without after using.  You just need to have strong mechanical aptitude to figure out the special installation method and special parts, when required.  Still not changing rating.  Great item, but very hard to install on my saw.",1.0
"The rods of the DW7080 Extention will only go into the bottom of the DW718 saw base several inches before they hit against metal.  The extension does not ""telescope"" in and out as Dewalt describes.  Storing the saw will take up more space unless you take the extention off.

The holes that the screws to secure the support rods in are not threaded from the factory.  I used a large flat head screw driver to push down really hard while the screws created initial thread.

You need to be careful that you do not strip the thread when screwing them in the first time.

Probably need to take care when securing the extention later as the base of the DW718 seems to be some kind of cast metal.

I've been borrowing my father in law's DW705 and he has the extension kit for that model which is great - it stows neatly under the base of the saw.  Not so with the DW7080 extension kit and the DW716 (both are advertised as being compatible).  I couldn't believe that it doesn't slide under the base more than a few inches.  This is practically useless since I don't always want 20"" sticking out the side of the saw.  Others noted the same issue with their model saws.  If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed.  Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews.  I didn't have any issues, just a little annoying but not a big deal since the instructions explained this.",1.0
"Ok I admit it, I misread the advertisement and thought I was buying a pair (set) of extensions.  For the price, I feel one extension set is a rip-off and DeWalt should consider selling a set at a price somewhere between $32 for 1 set but certainly not $64 for 2 sets (list price is $88 for 2 sets).
One set is useless when, for example, sawing crown moldings or similar instances.  Nobody wants to keep switching the extension back and forth.",1.0

I got scammed by dewalt and I don't know why with all the coin they are making in profit of people they cant make some proper accesories. Yes it does suck that my 706 saw came with ZERO accesories, but i don't mind paying extra for accesories I want and need, if they are made right, they were hitting the crack pipe when they designed this, and It looks like it won't even work on a 708 saw as the holes are spread further apart. All I ask DEFAULT, I mean dewalt is you fix your website so that the 706 is not listed as compatible with this piece, and then make me one that will work, and WILL slide under the saw.

I like apparently several other people have received a damaged stand box with missing parts. My box is missing the rear adjustable leg, the bolts and the instructions show a rear leg plate that I assume the saw is suppose to attach to.

"This really isn't about the stand, since having received 2 shipments thus far, I haven't gotten a usable one. Just wanted to add my (disappointed) voice to the others who have gotten damaged boxes and missing parts.
These stands were part of the discount bundle Amazon has with the DEWALT 788 Scroll Saw. In both cases, the boxes I received were beat up badly and retaped. The first box was virtually empty, all that remained was one leg and a cross brace. The one that arrived today had a crisp 5x5 inch square hole cut in it through which someone had reached in and removed the bag of fasteners. The hole had been taped over with transparent tape, so it was obvious that the box had been tampered with. My experience has certainly made me a believer in the theory that Amazon is recycling returns. You can draw your own conclusions as to how much quality control is going on there. Hope you have better luck with the stand than I did.",1.0
"In my initial review, I rated this product one star because it arrived as an incomplete package -- two legs and all the hardware were missing. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and it arrived after about 4 days. Out of the box, I noticed that all the finished parts were enclosed in a plastic sleave, which wasn't the case with the first shipment, so what I received was probably a canabalized return.

The stand was fairly easy to assemble, but, like another reviewer, I was perplexed that there were so many pieces. Every bolt has a nut, washer, and lock washer, and there's a lot of bolts. Deft fingers, a half-inch socket, and patience are needed to complete the assembly.

But, when done, the stand is sturdy. One confusing point - there's an adjustable (vertically) foot for the rear leg that tilts the saw downward back to front. I may take it off - anyone have any idea why it's there?

When placing the DW788 saw (which arrived broken, see my separate review of that) onto the stand, I was surprised that the saw base has little surface area contact with the stand, and that the mounting bolts go upwards from the stand top into the saw base such that the nuts and washers are visible (and snag-able). Not a big deal, just surprising given that the saw and stand are made for each other and all other stand nuts/bolts fasten with the nuts/washers being hidden.

I'm going to upgrade the stand rating from one star to three because it seems okay at this point. I'd like to see how the nuts and bolts withstand use; some engineering could remove the assembly complexity, in my opinion. Too bad Amazon won't let me change the star rating...",1.0
"I was so excited to get this saw for Christmas, unfortunately I had to return it the next day.  The saw was heavy and solid, at first glance it seemed like a lot of saw for the money. ($315 Cyber Monday deal)  I quickly discovered that the same two problems others had commented about, made my saw not usable.  The table alignment placed the blade right on the metal of the table opening.  This alignment could not be adjusted away.  I could have ground away metal where the table was attached and made the saw workable, but the warranty would have been voided.  The second issue was vibration.  It was smooth and quiet at lower speeds, but after the #4 setting it shook violently.  It is sad because this is a heavy duty tool with poor quality control over production tolerances.  I know I got this saw at a great price and suspect Amazon was ""blowing them out"" on-line hoping folks would keep them and make do with the problems.  I know scroll saws, I have had 39 years experience using scroll saws in my middle school wood shop. This saw was a ""lemon"".  On the brighter side, I was very impressed with Amazon's return.  I downloaded the free shipping label for the 73 pound box, dropped it at UPS, and received an email from Amazon 6 hours later saying my credit card had been refunded!  With this kind of service, I will continue to use trust Amazon knowing that the risk of a bad purchase will be taken care of.",1.0
"Dewalt is a great company with good product, but this one , too fragile. One week after working with it the neck broke. Called Dewalt and they wanted me to go to their service center to check if its replaceable.

"This is a very poorly made accessory for the lower end Delta table saws.  The mill work done after the casting is poor at best .  My does not fit the table saw the way it should.  When the extension is leveled to the work surface, the fence needs to be coaxed past the joint due to the poor fit.  Delta does not seem to spend much time or money producing a quality for their low end power tools.  My next power tool purchase will be from another company.",1.0
"When these saws were made in Canada they were a very good ,very dependable,JOY TO WORK WITH. Things have gone down hill dramatically with the quality control aspect of this saw since the manufacturing was moved to Asia. The blade holes of the majority of these saws are misaligned. The table surfaces are crudely machined. Two very important things that need to be addressed. This saw now leaves much to be desired as a mid priced scroll saw. If they are going to lower the quality they need to lower the price.",1.0

"This edge guide is designed to fit routers from 1.25 to 3 HP.  The hold down screws are thus designed to secure attaching rods from different widths, thus, they screw down on the edge of the rods rather than directly on top of the rods.  The result is that as they are tightened, the torque causes the fence to flex out of alignment.  So it takes several attempts to get it in proper alignment.  The desire to make this fit such a variety of routers makes a piece of junk to me.  I am very disappointed in this accessory.  BTW, I have been a woodworker for 35+'years, so I'm not a novice.",1.0
The framework of the saw prevented it from being adjusted to cut square.  It was incapable of being adjusted.  I returned it.  I then went to a store where I could actually test the adjustment and bought the same model off the shelf.,1.0
"Out of the box this is cutting almost 1/4"" to the right of the 0 degree line (and two people tested it).  I used up all of the shoe adjustment and can only get it to cut within 1/16"" of the line on test cuts.  Debating return if the local recommended DeWalt service center can't adjust correctly (and without it costing me extra).  Beside that... looks good, feels solid, operates quieter than previously owned saws and love the electric brake.  Just a shame its so out of alignment from the factory.

To add... local service center would send saw out to DeWalt (estimated turn around was a few weeks), so I opted to request an exchange through Amazon (who has been great dealing with).  Second saw arrived in two days and I was excited again, but only for a short time.  The second saw also cut to the right of the guide line, but this time it was only initially 1/8"" out of alignment.  I attempted to adjust (COME ON!!! ADJUSTING A NEW SAW!) The adjustment only adjusts the shoe from the back.  Now the saw is measured 5 1/2"" from blade to edge of shoe near the rear, but remains 5 5/8"" from the blade to the edge of the shoe in the front.

This one is going back too!  Done with DeWalt tools, its a shame I have so many of them.  Running to the local Home Depot.

To finalize...  priced saws and Home Depot and Lowes.  To my surprise Lowes had the same saw!  My curiosity burned and I grabbed it.  Once home I measured the distance from the left edge of the blade to the left edge of the shoe, which the instruction manual emphatically states should measure 5 1/2"".  The saw is precisely 5 5/8"" when measured from the front and rear edge of the blade.",1.0
"I had this light for about two months. Its handy because it shares the same battery as my other poorly thought out Dewalt tool investments. The light is just barely bright enough to work with and drains the battery very quickly. The light fell out of my tool bag and the swivel head broke off. When I took it apart to see if I could fix it, I found why it broke and was surprised it hadn't broken before. The swivel head is held on with a thin lip of brittle plastic. This is not an industrial grade tool!

When I started out the Dewalt tools seemed like a more affordable option over ""real"" industrial tool brands. Sadly after some time in the field I have learned Dewalt is nothing more than home owner hobby grade crap. I am done with them and will slowly begin replacing my Dewalt tools with Milwaukee.",1.0
"Purchased this item as an extension to my router table and am very displeased.  The Item was packaged sufficiently. The Directions were also sufficient.  The main body is a stamped steel edge which is connected to the rails via a cast aluminum piece that needed to be finagled  to accept the rails.  The holes on the router base that accept the rails were too large, and the rails had lots of play until they were tightened.  And the worst part of it all is the edge of the ""Router EDGE guide"" was not straight!! held up to a straight edge, there was a 1/16+ gap on one side, which would cause it to rock during the cut.
  This is not a tool for woodworking at any level and makes me consider getting rid of the router as well!!",1.0
"This saw has a great design,  nice big table,  quiet running,  extra easy blade change.  I use this saw about 5 hours a week.  Gone through two motors in two years. Too expensive to be a throw away saw.........",1.0
"I ordered this saw for its desirable features--namely the electric brake, convenient blade height adjustment, and a slot to hold the cord out of the way.  This saw is one of the worst tools I've used in quite sometime.  It arrived with a bent shoe due to manufacturers cutting corners nowadays using die struck plate instead of ribbed castings even on higher end saws.  The sight line cutout on the shoe lined up with nothing.  It was supposedly designed to place the kerf flush on the right side of the line.  When sawing exactly on the line, the distance between the kerf and the line was almost an eighth of an inch. The worst part of this saw is its incredibly bad balance.  It wanted to naturally heel at the beginning of cuts, and I found myself always fighting it to enter the cut with a level shoe.  This is important if one wants to make a series of shallow cuts that get chiseled out (faster than a router for rough work) The saw is heavy which is tolerable.  Heavy and unbalanced make for a tool that one is always compensating for--it gets tiresome in a hurry.  Pick up a circular saw that is well balanced being neither front heavy nor rear heavy and feel the difference.  The Dewalt would also bind in certain situations due to the heavier than necessary spring on the blade guard.  I have returned this saw, and bought a Bosch instead.  I would have considered Porter Cable also, but could not find one like my old one with the ribbed diecast shoe that stays flat. The Dewalt's blade brake and easy rear pivot blade height adjustment just do not compensate for a badly designed tool with poor quality control.  Has Dewalt become nothing more than another great company in a long line of quality manufacturers prostituted for its brand name?",1.0

"I found this drill unusable and I returned it. The first time I used the drill I squeezed the trigger slowly, but it seemed to jump from no power to almost full power. I used the side handle and two hands as recommended, but the drill spun uncontrollably and caused a large bruise on my right hand and a bruised finger on the other hand. Fortunately I didn't suffer any permanent injury. The manual warns, ""Always expect a stall. Grip the drill firmly with  both hands to control twisting action and avoid injury."" But even with both hands I was not able to control it. This drill may be fine for experienced construction professionals, but I would caution novices from buying it.",1.0
I have two of these saws in the junior high where I teach.  Both had endless electrical problems.  The saws only had light use before they began to break down.,1.0
"The drill worked OK at first except that the chuck is eccentric -- it wobbles,so the hole you get is bigger than the drill bit you're using. After about an hour of drilling time (not, of course, non-stop drilling), the trigger developed a dead spot wherein when I squeezed with gradually increasing pressure (so as to gradually increase drill speed), a few seconds into the ramp-up it quit -- just stopped cold. When that happened the first time, it just would not run again. The next day I tried it again, but except for one burst of full-speed running, it would not come on. (Outlets and cords checked out fine.)
So overall it rates as very poor quality. I would not buy another.",1.0

"I bought this saw less than a year ago. With less than ten hours on it, the motor burned out.  Dewalt told me to take it to a service center which I did. They replaced the motor, but after getting it back I have problems with the saw stopping in mid cut! To make matters worse, I t will not hold a #2 blade in the bottom blade holder. I use Olson blades, and after ruining a dozen, I called Dewalt again, and once again they told me to take it back for repairs. Since the closest repair facility is 50 miles from where live, this is an uneeded time and expense to me. To make matters worse, the service person I talked to told that was "" A fragile machine ""!

The repair shop took their time (3 months) to fix and then they broke again a month later.  Back to the shop and 4 more months!  Both circuit boards went out and the linkage get very sloppy.

"I used to demo these seven years ago and was really excited about getting my own.  They were very close to Excalibur then and were more than half the going price.  After taking it out of the box I noticed the extremely poor job of milling on the table top.  I was going to deal with it latter but after setting it up the variable speed control was not variable at all.  No matter what I did it would not change speed (it looked to be stuck at at the low setting) and it is going back.  On closer inspection the seam of the casing also seemed to be off and I could see clear gaps (1/32 to 1/16).  The box was not dented and was in perfect shape so I don't believe it was done while shipping.  If the next one is milled in the same manner I am going to go with an Excalibur, I have seen Dremel and Craftsman with better milling and finishing at half the price.  Very disappointed and would never buy over the internet or without examining it at the store first, including turning it on and playing with the variable speed dial..",1.0
"If you are a hobbyist, and you don't have plans to ever cut anything thicker than 1/4 inch, then you don't need this saw anyway. If you want to do quality work, you don't need this saw. If you want to pay a high price for extremely bad quality control, then this is the saw for you.

Older models of this saw aren't so bad, older as in over 6+ years old. I purchased mine about 4 years ago, and the arms aren't even the same length. You can't get the blade square to the table. The top arm is literally longer than the bottom arm. How do you possibly miss something like that during manufacturing? Complaints from others includes a non-flat cutting table, too much distance between the arms making blade insertion difficult, or in some some cases, preventing it all together.

The original design of this saw was excellent. Too bad that Dewalt can't figure out how to successfully manufacture it.

If you think your saw is okay, you might want to tension up a blade and check it for square, side to side and front to back. You might be surprised at what you find.",1.0
"After purchasing this saw, I read a review written recently by Jay. I had the same problem with the table screw holes not tapped in the correct location causing the blade to hit the table(only off by about 1/8th""). I called Dewalt and the service rep. told me that he wasn't aware of any problems with this saw. After speaking with the rep, he told me that I could file the holes that support the table. I asked if this would void the warranty and he said no. I filed the arm screw holes, however I am not happy with Dewalt. The saw seems to run good, but I just can't recommend it to anyone until Dewalt does something to resolve this issue. The only way I would buy it is from a local store so it can be checked out. Sorry for the lengthy review..GOOD LUCK!",1.0
"Sometime in the recent past, DeWalt moved the manufacturing for this saw from Canada to Asia.  I recently ordered the saw for my father, and the one he got (and TWO replacements) all had problems due to poor quality control or manufacturing or both.  I am a woodworker and own and have used many quality DeWalt tools over the years, so I was surprised at these problems.

There are two bolts which hold the table in place, and on ALL THREE SAWS the bolt holes were apparently drilled off-center and mis-aligned, causing the blade to hit the side of the table slot (on the same side all 3 times).  We spoke to the scroll saw manager at DeWalt and he was very aware of the problem but didn't offer to do anything to fix it other than return our money. (He even admitted to have several saws in his office that had been returned from customers with this problem.) He said he had ""reported the issue to management"" multiple times but nothing had been done for several months.  Apparently this affects a large portion of the new saws coming from the new manufacturing facility in Asia.  Buyer BEWARE.

I am not totally surprised at the fact that DeWalt is having the manufacturing problem.  I *am* surprised that they are doing little or nothing to fix it.  At the very least I suggested that they put a quality check in place at the factory to check for this problem before they shipped out the saw and reject the ones with the problem.  They have NOT done this, but instead tell their support people to ask the customer to ""drill out the holes to allow the bolts to move over"".  Not on a brand new $500 saw thank you!  We even asked the product manager if he could have someone in his distribution center open a box to check a saw for us and ship us a known good one; but he declined saying ""he didn't have anyone who could do that"".  DeWalt is a better company than this and they shouldn't be allowing this kind of poor quality.

UPDATE: Several months later after I wrote this review, we decided to give this saw one more chance and ordered a FOURTH one.  Luckily this was was finally correct, and my father is very happy with it.  The saw lives up to its original reputation.  No vibration, precise clean cuts, etc.  Now if you can get a good one in LESS THAN FOUR TRYs!!!",1.0

I still bought them because you really must have them if you do any anount of crown.  The real disapointment is that for that much money you'd think they would at least be square.  Mine are not (out of the box).  When dewalt sat down and designed this thing there were only two basic requirements - it must attach to the side of the saw with a slot that allows adjustment and then turn square so as to be parrallel to the fence.  It is totally unbelievable that they could fail at this.  No name tools manufactured on a dirt floor in the south pacific would likely be more succesful in producing this product.

If this was made in the USA then the poor quality control of China is rubbing off on US manufacturing.  Or else it was made by former UAW people from Detroit and Dearborn.  The blades advertised next to the item do not fit. Its not a 10mm arbor.  It is a 1/2 inch arbor.  And you have to attach the blade with the writing facing the inside as this is for a left hander.

"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills, Table Saws, etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw, hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further, unless you are working in pitch black, the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light, that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight, it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher.....",1.0
"This DeWalt light came with a scroll saw/light/stand package deal at another website.  The light looks great and mounts quickly, but that is where the excitement ends.  The gooseneck is far too weak to support its own heavy head weight given the mounting location on the saw, and how horizontal the light needs to be to reach the work area.

We ended up supporting the light halfway down the gooseneck by using two zip ties to secure the gooseneck to the upper saw arm.  We used a piece of foam between the gooseneck and the saw arm to prevent vibration and paint damage.  Taking this weight off helped, but is tacky looking.  Considered mounting it to the saw stand for a more vertical mount, but then it would be in the way of large work pieces.

The on/off switch has a nice snap and weight to it, so it feels like it will last.  We are using this saw/light in a room with poor lighting.  The bulb is plenty bright.  The head/bulb gets pretty hot.  In the right position to prevent shadows, your forehead is pretty darn close to the light, but its fine.

If you bought your DeWalt scroll saw without a light, and you're looking for a light now, look elsewhere until DeWalt finds a better Chinese supplier.  The current light is not up to snuff for this application.

UPDATE: 1/27/2010  HEY DEWALT - LISTEN UP!  I did this review without looking at the other reviews.  Just ran across the review and decided to read the others.  To my astonishment the reviews have not changed in 10 years.  DeWalt, that is just pathetic.  How many more of these lights do you need to sell to get rid of the batch you had made in China 10 years ago?  Enough already, do your customers a favor and throw the whole lot away and find a better light.  Is this why I got the light 'free' in a package deal with the stand (nice stand), so I can't complain because I got it free?  Well, this product number still has your name attached doesn't it?  It is obviously a problem, you know about it, manage the issue.

"Does not fit the DWS780 properly.  You'd think if you buy the most expensive miter saw, that it would be well designed.  Well, think again.  The stops work, but they DO NOT fit the DWS780 because the holes are NOT threaded on the saw base.  Dewalt thinks it's okay instead to ship these stops with a ghetto-fabulous nut that you can barely thread as you have to reach under the saw.  Which you have to do EVERY time you want to use the stops.

Removing them is also difficult - you can't just flip them up to the back - you need to remove them all the way...and that awesome non-threaded hole in the DWS780 makes removing them frustrating because the nuts spin, and usually you drop one at least once so that's fun too.",1.0

"Absolute junk! I wanted to use this with my delta 14"" band saw but it's easier to move without this thing. The castering wheel doesn't turn when you put it down so you can only roll it in a straight line. And it wants to tip over if you try to rotate the wheel. It's a design problem because the caster is at an angle when the foot lever is pushed down. I can probably modify it so it's at least usable, but I shouldn't have to do delta's design work for them. Another problem is that the hardware is too short. I had to squeeze some of the parts just to get a single nut thread on the bolt. And some didn't have full thread engagement when fully tightened. But I was worried they would strip if I tightened them any more. They really cut corners on this thing. This was my first delta purchase in a few years but it will probably be my last.",1.0

"Wasn't very well thought out as far mounting the light bulb. Could not get my fingers around the bulb to screw into socket.

"rather get the DW272.  I don't know if it was an isolated instance, but I couldn't keep the nose assembly tight.  I believe the threads were stripped, and it wouldn't stay tight.

The DW272 has not had the same problem.  When I purchased it, my instinct said ""plastic isn't durable and it looks like it could be weak at the nose"", and well in this case it proved to be true.

Clearance was't enough to make it over door frame on the floor. If you have lots of time and like projects and only have to shift the table around a little then this might work for you.  Personnally I think I could move the table over just as easy without this thing.  I have a scroll saw on the table in question.

when i need to replace the lamp- what is the lamp number and where may i find one? why is the this lamp a appliance lamp and not a LED. we live in Phoenix Arizona area we do NOT need any thing that make unneeded heat. do you want to work under a heat lamp?
i will NOT recommend to any one",1.0

"I purchased three of these Delta Mobile Bases, model 50-345.  Very disappointed at the poor quality control of the hardware included.

I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes, bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag.",1.0

Since I was changing from a 1/4"" blade, I had to reset all my guides, tracking and tension.  The upper blade support was about 1/4"" above the surface of the plastic. I've been doing this for 25+ years so I know how to set up a saw for a particular blade.

This blade broke after about 10 minutes.  And it was probably less than 5 minutes of actual cutting.  The job at hand required trimming a stack of 3/8 x 1/8 plastic strips to length.

An extended fence was used which supports the plastic strip on both sides of the blade.  A cutout was placed in the fence at the blade position and a stop was placed in the T-Fence slot so once the blade got through the plastic it never touched the extended fence.",1.0

"Family board games are back. And unlike all those Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley games we grew up on, they're actually fun, playable within and hour or two, and have balanced gameplay.

This 1960s classic has been cited as the inspiration for game designers behind modern classics like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride. Acquire is kind of like Bingo meets Monopoly, but with stock speculation. Each game evolves differently and it never gets boring. I remember one vacation with friends we must have played this game 25 times over the course of a long weekend.

It requires 3 players to play, but really comes into its own with 4 or more players. In a 6 way game, you'll never be able to remember who owns what!",5.0

"I highly recommend this board game for those who enjoy the idea of Monopoly, but don't want to actually play it.  Although this game has many forms, this version involves investing and building hotels.  Players found hotels, merge them with others, invest in stock, and cash out their stock and acquire bonuses to reinvest in other hotels.  It takes, on average, around 60-90 minutes to play with 4 people and does not get any less interesting from game to game.  I haven't regretted this purchase unlike other boring board games.",5.0

In some ways it has a similar feel to Monopoly, but instead of one person making all the money and slowly sucking everyone else dry, everyone makes money the whole game, just some people end up with more money than others by the end and that's how the winner is determined. It's pretty fun. It's a little more complicated than Monopoly to learn, but after playing through the game once you'll have a pretty good grasp of the strategy.",5.0

It's still strategic and fun... but different than the others.  Everyone we've played it with really enjoys it!  It's our new favorite game to teach people because it doesn't take several hours to learn like some games, so it's reasonable in length, but it's long enough to still be fun and use some skill.",5.0

Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended.,5.0
"This game is addictive! More fun and much more sophisticated than Monopoly, yet similar premise. Faster paced and each game is completely different than the last. Highly recommend this Acquire!",5.0
"My family and my wife's sister's family play this game regularly.  It's even generated some ""family-isms"" we use on a regular basis.  (""Don't poke the bull!""...I'm a Taurus.) We have the older game with the plastic tiles and locking board, and my sister-in-law has the newer cardboard version.  It's a bit confusing to switch between the two since some hotels with the same name have different values, but it's not too tough to make the adjustment.

One thing we do to hold our tiles in the older game (which doesn't come with its own holder) is use the tile holders from Scrabble; they work great for holding the plastic tiles.

This is a great game for anyone high-school age or older.  It requires thought, planning, strategy, and the usual bit of luck.  Some of our best moments have come when one person's plans are unwittingly destroyed by someone else, a common occurence.  Sometimes we even have a surprise ending (i.e. the person who seemed to be ahead the whole game gets narrowly beaten out).

The one drawback to this game is that, if you are not involved in the first few mergers, you have a high risk of sitting there the rest of the game with nothing to do and no chance to win.  In our group, this happens to someone about once every three games.",5.0
"This is a game that my grandmother had when I was young (age 10 or so).

I did give it as a gift to my mother but do plan on purchasing it again for myself and family.  It does take quite a long time to play....not a fast game.  It also does not have any bells, electronic noises, or anything fancy.  It is truly a board game and if you like the idea of being able to ""acquire"" or basically control the game with your property, then you will love this game.",5.0
"I love this game, as does my family, including my 8 year old sister.

The mechanics are excellent but you can find that out elsewhere.

The product was received in great condition, factory wrapped and everything.

The stock cards may wear with age so I laminated them. Note to possible followers, buy the proper sized lamination cards. Laminating 8 or so cards at a time in an A4 sized sheet is not fun and neither is cutting them down to a standard size.

The 'stock rate' cheat sheet may tear when erm.. tearing them from the book. Go slow and you must laminate afterward.",5.0

There is no other game out there that is this fun, and this fast to play (45 min/game).  This edition kinda sucks for the reasons listed in other reviews, but get ANY copy of the game and it will be worth it.  The 1960s version is the same game and rules as it is today.  50 years of playability and going strong.",5.0
"If you have never played, don't let the reviews turn you off. This is a wonderful, mind working game.

Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.

I personally have been waiting for a ""flat""version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better ""locking system"" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.

So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.

Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).",5.0
Great game and great replay value.  Play alone or with up to 4 friends (5total players).  Takes from 30mins to 120mins tops so not all night and if you want to play longer u can play another adventure.  Clean-up can be a bit of a pain but not a big deal.,5.0
"Wrath of Ashardalon is a fun game.  If you like dungeon style board games that use cooperative play mechanics, then you'll really enjoy this.

Unlike many other games in the genre, this game is fully cooperative.  There's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters.  Because of that however, there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session.  Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character.  The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards, sort of like a simple AI computer program.  It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun.

There's an adventure book which outlines the different scenarios for the game and it can combine with the other game(s) in the D&D Boardgame series for more play options.  There are many unpainted miniatures in the game along with a ton of cardboard chits.",5.0
"I was skeptical about 'Castle Ravenloft' despite it having received mostly glowing reviews so I decided to skip it when it was released last Fall. Having played a lot of Dungeon and Dragons Miniatures 2.0 [DDM 2.0] 'til it died in 2008 [and kept alive via fans and members of the design team, some of whom worked on CR and Wrath of Ashardalon [WoA] and enjoyed D&D and AD&D from the original Gygax offerings thru 4th Edition, I wasn't sure if this self-contained boardgame would offer enough entertainment variety for me and my fantasy RPG combat-heavy loving friends. Having read all of the positive reviews on Amazon as well as other sites including ars technica and mtv.com of all places, I felt as if I was duty bound to acquire this game for some reason. The main draw for me was that it contained additional elements beyond what was offered in CR [which again, I hadn't played].

Once I received WoA, I couldn't have been happier that I took the plunge! The quality of the gamepieces and punchout tiles and tokens are top notch. The last time I purchased a boardgame was September of 2009 when Games Workshop re-released their latest anniversary edition of Space Hulk; that was an exceptional product overall and cost $100. D&D: WoA felt nearly equal in quality once I removed everything from the confines of its ginormous box; pretty good for something that cost less than $50 via Amazon.com!

I've played several of the included adventures with people whose ages ranged from 8 (my eldest son) to 38, some with boardgame or RP/miniatures skirmish based experience and some with none at all; it was very easy to introduce the rules to all of them and in every instance we all had a great time. Some of the people I 'snookered' into playing this were sold on the concept that they would essentially be playing a tangible, 3-D ver. of the classic game 'Gauntlet' or Rogue-like dungeon crawlers that are still popular today [on phones or the DS/PSP, etc.]. It's greatest strength is probably due to the fact that it's a co-operative game; we all definitely enjoyed the pressure of meeting the required goals and succeeding at them, yet also each having the ability to deter us all from completing those goals due to every Encounter card draw or Monster/Villain action per player's turns.

I've since received D&D: Castle Ravenloft as a gift, and have come to enjoy that tremendously as well. I look forward to future game sessions where we'll mix and match the components of either game. D&D: The Legend of Drizz't can't come out soon enough....",5.0
"This game is a lot of fun and a good improvement on the Castle Ravenloft game. So far I've only played a few hours solo, but it's been very enjoyable. The new monster tactics, chambers, and doors add a lot to the system started with Ravenloft.

If you're looking for a fun co-op or solo game, this is what you are looking for.

The game works by drawing interlocking dungeon tiles randomly to create a new dungeon each time. Most adventures have you place an objective tile in your tile deck. Then when you lay down that objective tile, the adventure rules tells you what happens (usually a boss battle).

The game comes with 13 adventures, but it's super easy to make your own. Or if you just want to kill some monsters, throw a chamber tile in your dungeon tile deck and when you explore to that chamber tile, draw a chamber card to see what happens.

The components all seem very high quality. There have been complaints of warped cards, but I haven't experienced it yet (even after spilling beer all over my cleric's ability cards). People who have complained to Wizards of the Coast about warped cards are reporting that they have received replacement decks.

Great game for friends, family and for yourself.",5.0
"Wrath of Ashardalon gets everything right for a dungeon crawl board game. I'll break down all of the great highlights:

Set-Up
------
You divide out cards and characters. You put a start tile down, then you're ready to go. Super easy and fast.

Rules
-----
If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons, then you'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour. Not so here.

The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief. And you won't feel cheated. All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice. Damage is 1, 2 or 3 hit points. Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points. So creature die fast.

Each player adds more of a challenge. So if you solo, it's just as hard as with 5 people (more or less -- I think it's just a tad harder with more people). So as you add more people, their ability to play their role becomes crucial (fighters fight, clerics heal, wizards blast from afar, etc).

The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You have daily, utility and at-will powers. Swinging a sword is at-will, blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.

You collect experience as you kill creatures. If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters, then you can level up your character to gain more hit points, less chance of being hit and more powers.

Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is. The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.

Durability
----------
The game is very well made. The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use. The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.

Our cards warped a little one a humid night, but it wasn't horrible.

Nerd-Factor
-----------
This game had far less nerdness than regular D&D. But it also doesn't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing (like a long, emmersive and interactive storyline). You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.

Minitaures
----------
All of the pieces are very detailed. Some look identical to the D&D 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game. However, none of these pieces are painted. They are all one solid (or translucent) color.

Fun Factor
----------
Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy, everyone can enjoy playing on the same team. And you'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive (a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls, e.g. Descent:  Journey into the Darkness).

So, overall, it's just a good time with a bunch of friends. Win or lose, you'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.

Replayability
-------------
The game offers tons of quests and there's practically in infinite number more online. You could also just make up your own quests. The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing. And you can add more heroes, treasure cards, encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.

Overall
-------
This is the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played. I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.

Admittedly, I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it. Some of the skills in this game don't synergize very well together, but they do with the Ravenloft game. I have a feeling that Wizards of the Coast did that on purpose.",5.0
"Let me start by saying,""This is a great game"".I recomend it to anyone who enjoys board games or role playing games. It can be a family game also,for ""Game Night"",because it encourages cooperation with all players to win.(actually it forces cooperation in order to win).There are some things I would change,but I think everyone will have opinions on different ways to spawn monsters,events,etc....I just hope they develope it with every new edition.
  My game was missing the 20 sided die,I sent Wizards of the Coast an email and they responded right away and sent me one within a few days with a letter of apology. You can't ask for a better response. Keep up the good work. Bakis.",5.0
"I got the chance to play this board game last night, and I found it to be a much polished follow up to their earlier board game, ""Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game"".  You do not need to own or have plaid Ravenloft to play and enjoy this game.  In fact, I consider this a superior product.

First and foremost it comes with a wide variety of plastic miniatures, these are the same soft minis they release for their separate miniatures line meaning they won't chip or break, but also are unsuitable for traditional miniature painting.  They are unpainted, but the plastic color for each is chosen to denote the power and theme of the monster (red for demons, grey for duergar and so forth).

The artwork on the tiles is well done, and the tiles themselves are solidly constructed.  There is a huge variety of tokens and cards for all situations in the game, these are all competently put together.  If I had to pick 1 complaint, and it would be minor, it is that there are too many different varieties of tokens, and unless you put together some sort of sorting mechanism (plastic baggies work fine) it's easy to get the things you are looking for lost in a pile of tokens.

Gameplay starts by choosing a scenario from the included booklet, which includes everything you need to know to set up this particular adventure.  The scenarios increase in difficulty as you go along, but do not require continuity to play, so if you have a favorite you can jump right there.  Everybody plays, there is no person running this game for the players, it is entirely player driven.  Exploration occurs by drawing random tiles, which are accompanied by monsters and random encounters.

One fun touch are environment cards which are ambient effects that remain in play until another is drawn.  These range from an increase in the number of monsters drawn to walls of magma.  Players control the monsters they place, which are driven by simple scripts telling you what they do in clearly defined situations (if they are far away, move them up, if they are near attack, etc, etc.)

The rules system will be very familiar to anybody who has played 4th edition D&D, but simple enough for newcomers to grasp.  Once the game gets going, it quickly cascades giving a real feel of desperation without becoming unmanageable.  The random encounters and events are fairly well balanced, and I found this to be a solid game.

Awesome,5.0
Great game. Struggle at the begging on how to play but once we learned our family had a great time.,5.0
This is a GREAT way to get minis and an awesome dungeon crawl system to boot. It has inspired me to get into the world of DnD more thoroughly and I have been having a blast painting the minis as well. The Dungeon cards are great for assembling into just about any sort of underground encounter you could imagine.,5.0

"I bought this game as an impulse buy at Barnes and noble and I couldn't be happier with it. The entire product is just so well put together, and a great value for the money. This is one of those rare cases where quantity and quality both coincide. The miniatures are really nice and detailed, and I appreciate how they're color coated to help distinguish the heroes from the monsters. Plus, if you decide to move into playing actual D&D, you've got a kickass start to your miniature collection, as these work perfectly for table top role playing. (You get 6 orcs! Very useful!) The tokens and tiles included are also top notch, very durable and don't feel flimsy. Aside from that, the game is just an extremely good time with friends. The rules are simple, but the gameplay never feels mundain or boring due to great monster design and the awesome encounter system. This is a game I'm always excited to come back to, and one I'm proud to have in my collection. For 50$ here on amazon, this is one of the best deals I've seen in gaming.",5.0

"While it IS fun to play the traditional D&D tabletop game, when you can't get a DM, a larger group together to play, or you only have 45-60 minutes for play, any of the D&D boardgames will give you your fix!  Wrath of Ashardalon has great adventure storylines, quality pieces, and plentiful minis!  Well worth the purchase not only for the gameplay, but for the minis, too!",5.0
A must have for beginning D&D players! My sons love using this as a stand alone and will be adding more to it.,5.0
"A great gaming set for beginner GM's. If you are just looking to buy minis themselves this boxed set can be a good value.

The minis do come unpainted. But they can easily be painted to match the pre painted WOTC models for a fraction of the cost.",5.0

Awesome. Totally worth it!,5.0
This is a great game. If you don't feel like reading the instructions you can Watch it Played on YouTube. I decided to paint the miniatures which was also a lot of fun. I am thinking of buying the other DnD games to go with this one.,5.0
Fast shipping great game well worth it,5.0
"We have collected all of the D&D board games, and this is among our favorites. Stand alone games can be a few hours or you can do campaign mode which can last several sessions, much like a standard D&D campaign. Highly recommend for groups who never seem to want to DM but still want to play. The minis can be painted or left plain. They are excellently detailed, as are the player cards and other components. There are so many components we ended up having to use ziploc bags to keep everything organized. Great addition to a group who doesn't mind long winded games like Risk. We did end up having to implement our own house rules for things like traps which can sometimes bring the game to a grinding hault. Groups who are used to house rules will have no problem adapting the game to fit their group dynamic.",5.0
"Other reviews cover the game play aspects quite well so I will not go into that. This (and the other products in this line) are an excellent value for the content that you receive; you simply cannot find an equivalent deal on the number of miniatures, tokens and dungeon tiles that are in this box.

I use the components for DM'ing 5e D&D games and am extremely satisfied. The game itself is also great for introducing new players to a D&D lite that serves as a gateway for pulling them deeper into full role playing. I highly recommend for those looking to build out their collection of miniatures for tabletop gaming and for those looking to get a taste of D&D is about.",5.0
"Brutal. Awesomely brutal. The mechanics were simple to learn and the card effects were easy to understand. Which is great because it allows you to focus on how you're going to survive. It definitely encourages co-operative gameplay. The solo play-ability is also excellent. I especially like the ability to add elements from other sets (Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizzt, Temple of Elemental Evil) to create new scenarios.",5.0

"Great Game!  If you're interested in a board game style D&D adventure, this is a great start.  It also includes great miniatures and room tiles that are great for proper D&D adventures too!",5.0
"A fantastic purchase. 40 Miniatures for just under 50 dollars is a steal anywhere, and because the box is themed, I can run a RPG campaign outside of the board game. The game itself is easy to pick up, a great way to introduce curious gamers to the RPG world, though there is little imagination left up to the players.
The game is not played like a traditional RPG, there is no DM, everyone is both their character and draws traps and enemies from a deck for the whole group to face on their individual turns. A little confusing but probably easier to grasp for people who have never played a traditional RPG.",5.0
This game is engaging even for those who have little interest in D&D. I have used it as a stepping stone to get friends interested in further gaming.,5.0
"Worth the price for the wealth of plastic miniatures alone (see attached photograph). The box also includes some nice, thick punch-out dungeon map tiles that lock together like puzzle pieces. The 4e-based board game's a nice bonus feature as far as I'm concerned.",5.0
Great Game,5.0
"Loads of fun. If you've played any of the other D&D boardgames, this is more of the same. This set (Wrath of Ashardalon), in my opinion, is the most well-rounded among them all. It includes gold tokens which you can spend on buying treasures between adventures, a balanced set of heroes with memorable and unique abilities without being overpowered so as to make the game too easy, and the most relatable setting.

For those of you who haven't played the other boardgames, you don't have to own them all. Each one is a standalone game, but the rules, board pieces, cards, and characters are all interchangeable with each other. This game is a dungeon crawl, where each turn you explore a new room of the dungeon and deal with the things you find there - be it a monster, a trap, an encounter, or any/all of the above.

It's fully co-operative; there is no need for one player to be a dungeon master who plays by different rules from the others and acts as the ""villain,"" so you can even play this game solo if you really wanted to. The ""AI"" or rules for each of the monsters that you encounter in the game is determined by its card, so you don't have to worry about making people feel like they're being singled out (i.e. this game won't break friendships unlike Risk or Monopoly).

It's very approachable and you don't have to have ever played a game of Dungeons and Dragons to understand or even appreciate it. On the other hand, this could actually be a great way to introduce people to D&D if you're so inclined, as the rules are distilled and simplified versions of the actual tabletop roleplaying game.

A typical round of play, including set-up and pack-up, could last anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours on the extreme end.",5.0
"We have Drizzt and enjoy playing it. Even our younger kids are able to join in. (They are ages 7 & 5). We haven't cracked this one open yet (Father's Day gift), but expect nothing less than an amazing fun time.",5.0
"Be careful ordering this. My disk 5 was corrupted and scan disk couldn't fix it! Had to get Wizards to send another, which they did right away.

Graphics: excellent VGA graphics. Make sure you have at least 8mb of ram, because when Ashardalon appears during the final chapter it WILL freeze up your system!

Sound: will not work. Have the latest SoundBlaster card. Can't get any help on this one.

Gameplay: as long as you got the system requirement you'll have a great time. Light dnd gameplay that certainly satisfies the itch, especially if you can't get your dnd group together. Much better game than Menzoberranzan",5.0
Wonderful game!,5.0
"Tough game to learn just out of the box. Went online and watched some videos which helped A LOT. Played it first time though and ran into all sorts of things that weren't covered in the video so I was lost. After just playing a couple times though and having the manuals with you to reference, it became a lot of fun with no need to reference the manuals. All in all, it's a fun board game. Not just for ""nerds"" either. All can have fun with this game.",5.0
"Tons of replay value (due to randomized boss encounters) not to mention more than a few adventures in the book already. The only downside being that technically speaking, you can't ""carry over"" your character from one adventure to the next, but that's what house rules are for.",5.0

"If you, like me, used to play D&D, but now you and your friends ""growed up"" and can't be together because all the responsibilities and bla bla bla... this game is for you! Come to the Dungeon!",5.0
"With tons of replay value, this tense, cooperative adventure has quickly became one of my favorite casual games. You would think that, without a DM, the pacing wouldn't flow, but the designers were clever in forcing you to keep exploring to avoid hazards and traps. You never know what could be slithering around the corner.

What I love is how customizable it is. Yes, you should follow the rules to a T, but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt. Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters. If you're getting even more invested, create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures. You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $50 so the value is well worth it.

I only wish I'd found out about these games sooner.",5.0

"This game is very fun and all of the materials in the game are nicely made. It isn't just cheap toys. I also loved the shipping, came very quickly.",5.0
Great game if you like dungeon crawlers. My biggest complaint is that the rules are not very clear on many aspects especially monster movement and placement. Do these monsters walk right into our caltrops?! Of course they do there is nothing specially stating how they move. The game also could be a tad harder as we usually have little to no trouble beating it so I decided to include a picture were we were smashed into the ground by our enemies!,5.0
"As a disclaimer, one of my villain cards came with a factory defect where the machine burned into it but that should be a rarity. As far as the rest, these are the BEST miniatures I've ever had. The Cave Bears are my wife's favorite, while I LOVE the Otyugh! The insane number of Orcs, Duergar, extra Kobolds and devils is frickin' AWESOME!!! Seriously, this is more well balanced with even more new game features that stand to be even better than the previous Castle Ravenloft game.",5.0

"Brutal. You have to really plan out and strategize to win. Just the first adventure alone is already a meat grind, meaning monsters are grinding your flesh every step. The game is unforgiving. Make sure to read the rules on drawing Encounter Cards. Rulebook clearly says that if you didn't draw any dungeon tiles or you drew a dungeon tile with a black arrow, that you must draw an Encounter card. Translated to: If you stand around doing nothing, you will get either be Cursed, Trapped, Ambushed, Sniped Upon, fall into a Lava Pit, and be chased by Boulder all over the map, not to mention, Magwa walls where your Hero ends up adjacent to a wall, you lose 1 point of damage. Would I recommend this game? YES! The game is frustrating to a point that you wonder how do you ever complete a scenario. And that's the beauty of this game...it's not a walk in the park. You roll a D20 on this. Tons of monsters, loot, and encounters, beautifully made miniatures. It's a great game that requires patience. And yes, close the door when you're playing this if you have any kids around. The amount of expletives and dirty words will surely come out of your mouth when you are so close to killing a monster only to roll a ""1"". Highly recommended.",5.0
"Great game!! It is like playing D&D without all the overhead of a DM (everyone is a DM in a way).

"Include all items ,  got the package quickly",5.0
"Other reviews go into the specs of what's in the box, so I'm gonna keep this review opinionated.

I'm extremely happy with this game.  High quality, not very high, pieces: the minis look great, the tiles are wonderful, the cards are great.  It's a very fun game, and I enjoy it just as much by myself than when I play with a full group.

A couple negative things, but not too big, in my opinion, are due to packaging, some of the minis with swords or objects that stick out away from the mini can be bent when you open them.  This doesn't bother me that much, but I could see it bothering people who enjoy painting minis.  Another negative remark is the rulebook leaves a lot of gray area in certain situations during gameplay.  This isn't so bad if you can improvise a way around it, but it can definitely slow down play, and creates a lot of confusion.

Overall, this is a great value buy.  I don't think you can 30+ minis of this quality anywhere for this price, and the Ashardalon mini is beautiful.  I love this set.",5.0
"A simpler take on Dungeons and Dragons. No need for a DM, the game plays it out for you. Do you just want to dungeon crawl? Hack and slash your way to victory! Solo missions are available and this game can be mixed easily with other editions of the games! Tons of cards and miniatures. Worth every cent.",5.0
"My husband and I have been playing RPGs since, yes, the late 70s. I stole my brother's Basic D&D set, when he left it on his shelf and didn't touch it for over six months. He never missed it. I state this to let the reader know that I do, indeed, have a hefty background in Dungeons and Dragons.
My son just turned 11. He's been gaming with us since last summer, so he's getting the hang of this cooperative roleplaying thing.
Last night, we sat down to play this, with our partner, so we were a group of 4. It took some head-scratching, and re-reviewing the rules, and on-the-spot house-rule-making, but we had a blast.
We had a BLAST.
We won the first scenario, but lost the second one (ran out of Surge markers). We'll be painting up the miniatures over the next few weeks, and definitely going into our Family Game Night rotation, with Talisman, Ticket to Ride, Risk, Monopoly, and Fluxx.",5.0
"Before I purchased and played this game I had absolutely no idea if I would be able to defeat a dragon in real life. I wanted to believe I could, for love, for power, for gold, but I always felt in the back of my mind I would probably just die really fast. This game proved to me that I do indeed have the skill necessary to slay a dragon in real life, It has bolstered my confidence in such a way that ladies are now hanging all over me. I am no longer afraid of a dragon. Now my only concern is that the stick I use to pry women off of my confident form will one day break I will will be suffocated by passion.",5.0
This was given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. The game play is perfect for both advanced players of D&D and those who are just beginning.

I have enjoyed playing the other two D&D board games with my kids, I am sure we will enjoy adding this one to the mix.

"Lots of fun for family game night, for kids and adults.",5.0
"I couldn't be happier. This game is worth the buy for the minis alone. It's also great when your gaming group is just too tired to RP fully. Sometimes the group is distracted, or the DM is out of it. Break out any of the D&D board games, and play D&D lite. Plus you can still RP a little.",5.0
"In a nutshell... this game is slightly more challenging than Legend of Drizzt. So if you're a first time buyer from this series, I definitely would recommend holding off on this installment. That said, the classes are varied, the miniatures are exceptionally detailed, and the amount of content is unparalleled for a casual boardgame. I'm not exactly into table top games, but I do enjoy these because they are accessible and different from my usual go to games.",5.0

"If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons or other adventure/exploration games, you should definitely give WoA a try.  My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no ""Dungeon Master"" and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).

The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are ""handled"" by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.

I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack ""stackable"", so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.

Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.

Buy this game!",5.0
"I bought the game expecting that if I didn't enjoy the game, it was still a good price for a box full of mini's to use with other games.  But the game if a riot to play.  It's a random draw system based around a few key structures to provide a point to each dungeon crawl.  You could play the same run over and over and it'd probably be a few hundred times before it came up exactly the same.  A sense of desperation, but still not to tough.

It can combine with Castle Ravenloft and The Legend of Drizzt board games, each a stand alone set as well as this one.  A lot of online game modifications if you ever get tired of the main rules.  A few rules to learn, then most of the rules are given on the cards that are used in play.

One nice feature, 1-5 players.  If combined with the other titles, you could potentially play 1-15 players, though that's a lot people for this type of game.  Each player is partially running the game and playing at the same time.  The more players, the more monsters and traps and such, so it scales nicely in difficulty with however many players you have.

The mini's are unpainted, but still really nice looking.",5.0
"The playing pieces are of better quality than I was expecting for a game made in this day and age.
Game play is fun, and replayability is high. I bought this for my son, who enjoys games like these.

i haven't had a full chance to play with it yet but it is pretty cool. all the figures (even though unpainted) and neat and well sculpted. im getting in to the hobby of painting figures so the fact they are unpainted does not bother me. they are also very useful for any type of d&d campaign you are trying to do,5.0

"I play this game with all 3 of my kids and they love it (ages 13, 10, 6...2 boys and a girl).  The mechanics are fairly easy to understand and don't take long to get in to.  Even if you don't totally understand a rule, you can make it work for you in whatever manner.  We've done that before we totally understood certain aspects and the game was still not a cakewalk.  We have lost many missions which makes it all the more fun and challenging.  That way you don't win every time.  We also have Castle Ravenloft (another DnD game like this) and we have mixed characters even which is more fun for the kids:)  Great game to play instead of just playing some video games...this is where the great RPG's came from anyway.",5.0
"from all 3 of the board games this one is the hardest and best by far. Legends of drizzt is too easy if you play as drizzt. Please do yourself a favor and get this game! good for all types of people.

quick to learn and widely played. You do not have to role play with this game, so people who choose not to will still have the same amount of fun.",5.0

"Probably the best of the three D&D board games (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt).  The game itself is a big box of stuff (miniatures, maps tile, game pieces, rulebooks), so its a lot of fun to open.  The quality of everything is VERY good, so this game is going to last a long time.  Very replayable, and even supports playing solitaire (for those nights when everyone is out of town).",5.0
"Once I opened the box and unpacked everything I was ecstatic. The tiles are nice and thick so they should hold up well to countless replays. The mini's are great and as far as I can tell, it's all compatible with the RPG game. I foresee me running encounters and campaigns using the components from all 3 boxes. Great buy.",5.0
"If you have anyone in your life that enjoy's board games, or D&D in any form, they too will appreciate this. It's worth the price. I purchased it as  gift for my eldest son.  As I play'd D&D as a kid, I wanted to share it with my son/sons.  Therefore, I purchased it as a birthday gift and the following evening we all play'd. We had a blast. Thank you, for the good time/s",5.0
If your a D&D fan this is agreat stand alone game to play but with the other ones it makes it even better you can play the normal way or just use it to form your own D&D adventures to play through with your friends so sit down and enjoy the adventures to come.,5.0
its only 2-5 players so its unplayable when you're more people but its fun nonetheless this game is great and full of re playability.,5.0
"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you ""get it"" you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games, but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know, game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper ""in your head"" like I did, then you will LOVE this!",5.0

"I own this and Castle Ravenloft, which are the two I would always put together. WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it's difficulty is average (unlike CR which is cruel) and the heroes are good. These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a ""system"" of sorts. You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).

This game, when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends, just plays so well with the whole group. It's truly cooperative, every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.

I do suggest that if you buy this game, play it for a bit w/ the base rules, and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it ""a bit mechanically repetitive"" then pause, go to boardgamegeek and find the variants (one I published in fact) that allow for an ""Initiative"" system - it will change everything and you'll be back to enjoy this game in no time!

Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $40.",5.0
"I bought this game as a cheap introduction to what D&D world would be, and to introduce my GF and some friends to a boardgame with a  little more RPG Elements than just rolling dice and killing stuff, the game was a real success the gameplay is easy to learn and the game may seem to be very straight forward but it will depends of the people playing it how fun can it be

I really recommend it, I'm 100% buying the other 2 games",5.0
I've been looking for a way to introduce my teens to D&D. This is a visual D&D lite and perfect for introducing them to ideas and mechanics that I've enjoyed for many years in my gaming.,5.0
"I would recommend this game to any fan of fantasy themed board games. I've always enjoyed the dungeons and dragons universe and this game is no exception. While it may seem daunting to some, keep in mind that the game contains outlines for different adventures with varying difficulty levels.

There are a lot of pieces but not all of them will be used for each adventure. Also, the rules can be flexible. Its kind of like landing on free parking in monopoly.  Depending on the house rules you may or may not get $500. Not everything is black and white where the rules are concerned. Let your imagination run wild. You can also use the pieces available to custom make you're own adventures. Or combine the other adventure system board games and dungeon command skirmish games to this and get even more creative. They all interconnect.

The miniature figurines are not prepainted so have some fun painting those as well. If you dig deep enough you can find user generated content online to add to your game. There are additional themed cards for monsters, heroes, encounters...etc. You can even find user created adventures.

Now if only I can find friends to play this game with. I'm only kidding. My wife enjoys playing and I've even played a few games over FaceTime with my brother and his family. That takes some extra preparation though. All in all this game has brought us hours of enjoyment with a lot more to come.",5.0
"Amazing game.. fun to play with my 6 year old who loves dungeon type board games.  If you liked the old board game Dungeon, this is like Dungeon on mega super ultra steroids.  Build your own dungeon each game, tons of different scenarios.. even play ALONE if you need to!  Don't hesitate!!!",5.0
I purchased this game after playing Castle Ravenloft.  I will have to say Wizards improved on the game without changing the dynamics of play.  The encounter deck is not as punishing while the items are definitely more useful.  I found the characters abilities more nuanced than the castle ravenloft characters.,5.0
"For those who are a fan of cooperative boardgames, this will be a great addition to your collection.  The game mechanics keep the challenge level intense enough to really push the players to support each other if they want to make it through successfully.  The pieces and miniatures are of high quality.  The varying scenario options that come with the game, combined with mechanics that easily lend themselves easily to customization and adding new material will give you a ton of re-playability.",5.0
"Who am I:
Middle aged married guy who loves Sci fi, video games and fantasy novels. Used to play D&D and then AD&D around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.

-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.

Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:
Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.

Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]
address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.

The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.

They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.

All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.

The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a ""real"" D&D session.
Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.

Possible Cons:
I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games ""punish"" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the ""punishment"" issue....

The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a ""real"" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may be a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.

The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)

Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.

There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.

So:
If you want ""real"" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.
If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.

Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems. I love this as it ads even more expansion options.",5.0
"This is simpler form of D&D to be sure, and it isn't ever going to replace real AD&D adventuring, but as an introduction to role-playing, it is terrific.  My twin 9 year olds love it and have declared it their favourite game.  I like the way the random elements of dungeoun tiles, monsters, encounters, etc. make the same adventures replayable numerous times.

I can also see that when there are only 2 or 3 of you available for that regular D&D night and you can' play your normal adventure, you can still have a game of this in an hour or 2 with all the fun of spell combinations without the need to do any set up.  Just choose a character and an adventure and start playing.

And even if you don't get excited by the gameplay (which I find perfectly good), there is more than enough value in the dungeoun tiles and figures to make you want to buy this.",5.0
"Overall I love this board game. I haven't played castle ravenloft, but I have played drizzt. Overall I like that it is more laid back than the DnD rpg because it is much more simplistic. Anyone that loves complexity and continuity to games will not be satisfied with this. This game is more: get your friends together for a night and kick back. I even started playing adventures with my wife who hated the rpg, but we have a good time going through these adventures. Because of that it is probably a good introduction game if you are trying to get your friends into DnD in general. I like that there isn't interruption from rule searching although it does take a few games to get the flow of the game. I also love the versatility of so many different quest scenarios I haven't even done the Ashardalon adventure and feel satisfied. If you play a two player game one of the players needs to be the cleric since it seems harderto survive than the drizzt game. Right now my wife and I are going through the three linked clan adventures doing well as the dwarf fighter and human cleric. Enjoy!",5.0
I got this game from a local shop and I must say I wish I would've known this was on amazon because its way cheaper. The game is super fun and to anyone that is even just a little bit interested in buying it DO IT! Wrath of Ashardalon is that fun and even more so when you have a full 5 people to play.,5.0
The components to the game are very durable thick card board stock. The miniatures are nice. However keep in mind this is not D&D this is a board game but it is very fun. Let's say your into D&D and you have a night where the DM isn't available. Why waste time setting up a new game with another DM that could take awhile? Just put this bad boy out and everyone should have a good time. I play it solo a lot as well which is just as fun too. I love it!,5.0
"This game has grat mechanics. I think many get it expecting to have the kind of experience you have within the standard D&D RPG, but this IS a BOARD GAME! Albeit; the play is great, but there is just so much you can do with randomization. That's randomizing tiles, treasures, etc.

All these cards are not as awful as several people have said in negative comments. It uses actual 4th Edition D&D and it plays well for people who just want a casual night of gaming with family and/or friends. It's nothing extravagant but it will keep you in D&D without having to be a DM(Dungeon master). That is plus for me, since I have been a DM all of my life and never had others who could DM but once or twice.

So yea, if you love good boardgames that the family can enjoy or just to have a casual night of gaming, this is the game for you.

I would suggest watching Rodney Smith's ""Watch it Played"" series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box, set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it, it helped me a lot!

"I just bought this game with my 8 year old son and we're completely happy with it.
I haven't played D&D since I was a kid and I really wanted to try a table top game with
my son. It's a big bonus that it's from the D&D guys.

My son was actually cheering and jumping up and down at time as we played. He was
definitely taken with this game. At one point he said ""This is better than video games!""
I agree.

It took us about 45 minutes to get the tiles popped out and read and understand the
instructions. I figured out most of the rules while my son geeked out over the cards and
figures.

Once we started, it was amazingly fun and the rules that we didn't quite understand at the
beginning became clear as we played. We actually played 2 games over 3 hours and can't
wait to play again tomorrow

The thing that's nice about the game is you can easily customize it to your tastes. It's a bit
like poker where you can play multiple variations on the similar sets and rules. I imagine that
the other two sets in the collection can be mixed and matched as well.

It comes with 13 adventures you can play from the adventure book or you can make your
own pretty easily.

Super fun and my 8 year old son took to it easily with only a little help. The guys at the store
I bought it from were saying it's too advanced for an 8 year old. They're crazy or don't know
any young kids. This is right up my son's alley.

I highly recommend this product!",5.0
"What this game is:  A rather simple, fast paced, dungeon based fantasy board game, that emphasizes team work.

What this game is not : A replacement for D&D Role Playing Games.

Like many of the adults who purchased Dungeon & Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon, I grew up playing fantasy board games such as Hero Quest, Dragon Strike, and Talisman.  I also played Dungeons and Dragons role playing game when I was younger.  Unfortunately, now my group of adult friends are not into role playing games so I picked up Wrath of Ashardalon with hopes that it'd be enjoyable to both experienced gamers and those who aren't.

Success.  Last night I played my first game with a group of my friends and we all had a very fun time, even though we lost.  This game is easy to learn, and fast paced so there aren't a lot of complex rules to have to remember.  One thing that we all enjoyed about this game is the fact that everyone works together as a team (as opposed to most board games) which I believe makes it an even better choice for children and younger gamers.  One thing to keep in mind however, is that the game can be difficult.  There are optional rules for making the game less challenging, which should be considered if you are playing with younger children.  For us adults, we still had fun even though we lost.  After losing we would discuss our ""tactics"" and how to do things better.  We would then generally setup the board and immediately try again.

As I said before the rules are pretty simple, but there are some situations where the rules might be unclear.  Usually we solved with with common sense, and deciding as a group what should happen.  But these situations were rare and didn't effect our gaming session in a negative way.

One thing to keep in mind however, that this is a board game... not a D&D role playing game.  So at the expense of depth and freedom of action, you have simple and easy to understand rules.  Perfect way to have fun with more casual gamers, children or those who are just getting into the D&D/RPG world.",5.0
"I recently bought Wrath of Ashardalon for my son's 10th birthday.  He's been wanting to play pen and paper RPG for a few years now and I thought this would be a nice entry way into that, it's not only that, it's much more.  The sheer volume of pieces that are required to play were are their own form of treasure.  The rules took a few hours of going over, but once we had it all figured it out the the games were going fast and furious.  He has to do his own math in determining if he ""hit"" a monster or not and I have noticed that this making him much quicker in calculating simple subtration in his head.  This is definitely a family game my wife and 12 year old play as well and we have a great time.  We are firm believers in the saying, ""the family that plays together, stays together"".  I am an old school pen and paper RPGr as well as computer and everything else in between, I love this game and always have a great time playing.  The designers have really created something unique and excellent here - I highly recommend to anyone that calls themseves a gamer and enjoys gaming no matter what the medium is!",5.0
"I play traditional D&D and have tried to teach friends how to play. Most of my efforts have been frustrated by the amount of time needed to prepare a proper character. This is D&D for the uninitiated. I taught several friends the rules in about 10 to 15 minutes. They had no idea they were learning the d20 system. The game is very similar to 4th ed. rules, but much more manageable.

The one-hour game also provides enough time to learn without being totally overwhelmed. The lack of a DM also serves as a nice bonus, especially for someone who ends up on the ""wrong"" side of the table from time to time.

This preserves the flavor of D&D much better than any video game and yet provides a good amount of accessibility. Plus, there are minis to paint.",5.0
"I've only played full D&D adventures a few times, and although I loved the concept, my main problem with D&D was the time investment and my noobish lack of understanding of the exact mechanics of the rules since I never had the opportunity to play with seasoned players.  Wrath of Ashardalon streamlines the entire process, simplifies the rules, and makes the game mechanics very clear.  Although I did need to look up a few rules clarifications on a couple of FAQs, it was easy to dive right in with a couple of friends and start playing immediately.

I can completely understand why veteran D&D players might be disappointed with this game, but I would propose that a veteran player could simply change the rules and add in whatever elements from the core D&D rulebook he or she wanted to use (including a DM) and simply treat this as a dungeon building/scenario pack with options for streamlining where desired.  That's my plan at least as I have a fun time using this game to ease myself into full-blown D&D at my own pace.

I'm more of a video game player, and to use an example from the video game world, take the classic game Civilization and its sequels.  You could play a full game that could take more than one day to finish, and sure it was a lot of fun.  However, Civilization Revolutions was later released as a streamlined, faster paced version of the classic, and I really enjoyed it as much as the original because sometimes I just didn't feel like committing many hours to a single game.  My impression is that Wrath of Ashardalon is to D&D as Civilization Revolutions is to Civilization.  One key difference of course is that you can adjust the amount of streamlining in Wrath of Ashardalon to make it as involved or not as a full-blown D&D adventure based on your personal preference.",5.0
"its amazing, actually. Wrath of Ashardalon has taken the basic themes and source material of the new edition of Dungeons and Dragons and distilled it into *something better*. not only is this a must own gem of a board game, i'd even say its the best thing Wizards of the Coast has released in years. highest recommendation.

Regardless...

Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1"" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.

What it is:
WoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.

Some of the adventures feature ""chambers"", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.

It's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.

It's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.

What it isn't:
A deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.

A completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.

Overly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)

What's in the box:
* 42 plastic heroes and monsters
* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles
* 200 encounter and treasure cards
* Rulebook
* Scenario book
* 20-sided die

Miniatures:
The game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&D Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.
4/5
Cardstock Dungeon Tiles:
They're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&D Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&D game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)
5/5
200 Encounter, Monster & Treasure cards
These are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.
5/5
Rulebook:
The rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.
3.5/5
Scenario Book (""Adventure Book"")
This has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&D, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.
4.5/5
20 sided die
AKA, the d20. THE iconic D&D symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&D Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.
5/5

Overall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one ""solo"" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.

I actually wouldn't mind running a full D&D campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.

All in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.

*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes. Setup per adventure doesn't take nearly as long (maybe 2-3 minutes)",5.0

"As a long-time collector of Dungeon Tiles I can say without reservation that this is the best collection yet published.  True, most of the tiles are recycled from old sets (all of them as far as I can tell), but with such a low price, a full ten sheets of durable double-sided tiles, and the incredibly handsome and even useful box, the new Essentials line of Dungeon Tiles outshines every past edition.

What is this thing?:
Dungeon Tiles are handsomely detailed pre-printed heavy cardstock 'pieces' that you can use to cobble together a map for wargames.  In this case the tiles are sized for D&D miniatures (~25-30mm), with the grid spacing hovering around an inch.  The Dungeon Tiles sets include a whole pile of tiles representing rooms, corridors, furniture, traps, and the like.

The Tiles:
The Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon contains a smrgsbord (a lot!) of tiles collected from previous editions, enough to build a respectable multi-room dungeon out of.  With a full ten sheets of double-sided tiles this is the biggest single collection published.

The Box:
In addition, the oversized box the tiles ship in provides superior protection to the tiles within, in addition to being a giant tile itself (the box is printed like a dungeon plinth and made from the same materials as the tiles themselves).  The box is easily big enough to store any loose tiles you might have collected from previous sets too, at least twice as thick as necessary for the product within.

The Value:
There has never been a better value in dungeon tiles published by Wizards of the Coast, between the number of tiles for your money, as well as the very handy box, this is a fantastic way for new DMs to build their collection of handy tiles.

Altogether this is a wonderful product for new DMs, or for those who wish to expand their collections.  If you already own several copies of every other Wizards produced Dungeon Tile you will not find anything new here beyond the box.",5.0

"I DIG THIS! It's a shame that 5-6 years ago I wasn't running any RPGs. I probably would have had these tiles already. This set is very versatile and will really enhance my battle mats for my players. I'm glad they are still reasonably priced and I'll be getting the other 2 master sets I've found here on Amazon. The box they come in are even wilderness tiled so you can potentially have multi-leveled terrain. It also cuts down a bit on setting up a random or story encounter. I will usuallydraw out the battle maps on a large grid map before it happens, but now I'll be able to just drop terrain where I might need it.",5.0

"Shipping was recieved perfectly intact.

I must really say this is one quality piece of product. The tiles are made of hardended cardboard material and easy to mix and match with the set where it comes in. Like many other reviews, the box is big enough to store extra sets of tiles (I personally use this box to store all ""Nature Themed"" tiles). For 15 dollars you recieve 10 sheets of amazing dungeon tiles of all sizes able to be placed side by side in any combination you wish, it also meshes greatly with other dungeon tile products for endless fun and building possibilities.

I recommend buying ""Ruins of War"", ""The Witchlight Fens"", ""Shattered Keeps"", and or ""Castle Grimstead"" map packs to complement the tiles in this particular set.",5.0

The tiles are just as i hoped they would be. The graphics are very nice and the board is sturdy and should hold up well.,5.0
before this I hated running any RPG campaign dealing with towns because it kills the momentum and just becomes 2 hours of haggling for magic items. This helps open up story ideas and plot hooks.,5.0

Not a huge deal but upon pulling off the plastic the box completely fell apart as the pictures shown. Extremely disappointed, but I will update review upon receiving my replacement.",1.0

So many poorly written directions. You need three to play. And even then it's almost impossible. More time consuming than monopoly. And ridiculously frustrating.

"I'd give this a 0 stars if possible. I really don't understand how people are rating this game high at all. I'm a big GOT fan but this game is extremely dense, annoying, and not even remotely fun. To start, there are hundreds of pieces and it is confusing which piece is what. We had to google what some of the pieces were since the 20+ page rule book didn't say what they were. It took almost 2 hours just to set up the board the first game. The rules are extremely lengthy and also it seems there are exceptions to every rule. The section just on combat is 6+ pages.",1.0
"This game is terrible. I don't get all the positive reviews it has received. Being a huge GOT fan i had high hopes.

Took forever to figure out the rules. If you like other board game players like well defined rules, not rules that leave gaps on what it is or isn't. So the rules are not controversial. DO not buy this then. Several times had to look up online what other people thought was the definition of several rules.

The game-play is terrible. Takes far too long to do anything, however since the game ends in set number turns this doing anything quickly ended with us giving up as there was nothing we could do. It is too easy to block a player from doing anything with defend chips.

Several houses are WAAAY too powerful with the hero cards or w.e cards they get cant remeber now. Others are sooo gimped its pointless.

Game recommends 3 to 6 players. Well it doesnt mention before buying that if playing with only 3 you can only play on HALF of the board.",1.0

"I figured that this would be like the Talisman Expansion packs before like the dungeon or the city, but all this comes with is some plastic figurines (which is nicer than the cardboard the original comes with, but really who cares), bigger character cards (big deal) and fate points.

"My husband loves Risk. We both love GoT. Thinking this would be a nice meld between the two worlds, I bought this game for him for Christmas. Christmas morning he opened the box and together, we were excited. By the time the rest of the presents were open, we'd decided to play it right away.

Two hours later, we hadn't finished opening the game, I was halfway though the 100 page rule book, and the excitement was replaced by a deep loathing for this game.

This game is to Risk as 3d Chess is to real Chess. There are 8,000 pieces with lord only knows what function, there are three different ""tracks"" you can advance on, and those are just the easy parts. If you aren't a hard core gamer with several days to spend playing one round of this game, don't buy it.

Update: while moving, we threw this game away. While digging through a box from the closet, I uncovered a box that looked like this game and a moment of panic flashed through me. Had this game, in some Jumanjii-like fashion, come back to haunt me? Thankfully it was just Lord of the Rings Risk, but that moment of panic tells me just how absolutely terrible this game was...",1.0

"Review the 23 minute utube guide to this game BEFORE even considering buying this. If, after watching the video, you think you have a clue as to how it works, then consider it but if, like our family, it's even more obtuse after watching this very helpful video, then DO not buy it and recognize that you will never get those 23 minutes back. The game is incredibly confusing, the instructions are not helpful (in fact useless, go with the utube video), setting it up takes ages, terms are badly explained and seldom helpful; the game could be beyond a waste of time for most members of the human race.

"A GAME OF THRONES is all about appearance, and no substance at all. One of the most boring, tedious, superficial, unbalanced board games I've ever seen.

As a stroke of genius, Fantasy Flight quickly released a game based on the famous books.

The game has six factions, quick method of resolving combats, cards to try to add flavor of the book to the game. But nothing works. Heck, this game is much worse than the classic BRITANNIA.

The map board is beautiful, but It could be about any fictitious land ever written about.

This is a very common war game ( a simple one), extremely unbalanced when played with less than six players, with an annoying ""sudden death"" mechanism to end the game. The components are awful (both ""boats"" - what are that??? - and armies). Why spend time playing this when you have DOMINANT SPECIES, TERRA MYSTICA, BRITANNIA, ECLIPSE, well, a whole lot of things better?

I understand there is a public for everything, but this is just a terrible game, that does not work at any level.",1.0
"I was super excited when I saw the reviews... I thought this would be as good as the show.  My girlfriend and best friend have both been reading the books, and we've all been enjoying the series.

Too many pieces
Too many different types of pieces
Too much on the board - with not enough contrast (what's where?)

We gave up after 42 (timed) minutes of setup... and I just confirmed with said friend that it wasn't clear we had entered game play yet.  I believe we had, since we'd flipped over our tedious BS order tokens and then sat there wondering what the heck we were supposed to do after... Ahhh... the INSTRUCTIONS, indicated some nonsense about subparagraph C of part 32 chapter seven of the code of INSTRUCTIONS on page 11...

"This game falls into the ""Extremely Lengthy + Almost Completely Random"" category.

Highly recommend for those who like monopoly play-style and want a fantasy theme.

I find games like this a waste of time for me though.  If I'm going to invest countless hours into a single play, I want my decisions to have a large impact on the outcome.  This game does not provide that.",1.0
"I'm writing this review in hopes that someone finds an objective point of view about the game helpful. This is NOT a review colored with nostalgia or overly influenced (and blinded) by the games artwork.

Roll the dice, choose whether to move left or right, draw a random card or roll the dice again depending on where you land. I'd write more, but that's all there is to the game. Talisman is no more than the recycled mechanic from Monopoly with a fantasy theme tacked on. Oh sure, there are stats (health, manna, strength); there's good artwork; there's a plethora of expansions that can potentially suck your money in faster than it takes to play this 5 to 7 hour game (seriously: a game this simple shouldn't take as long or longer than a game of RISK. If you play this, be prepared to spend an entire afternoon or evening, and the time it takes to play increases with expansions).

Don't believe the hype; don't get distracted by the artwork; please please consider that there are better games out there for your hard-earned money (like Thunderstone Advance or Mage Knight or Stratego or the Space Hulk Card Game). In short, don't buy this game. If you do, be prepared to leave your brain at the door.",1.0
"I have played this game 3 times. I did not enjoy the game after the first play, but decided to give it a fair chance. The #1 issue with the game is the poor balance of the different races. Some of the races have clearly better combat cards than others. I understand that the idea of playing a combat card blindly during combat is supposed to allow for mind games, but some races have cards that simply cannot lose to one of their neighbors if played optimally (at least for 3 or 4 combats in a row), so mind games are irrelevant because optimal play wins.

That leads to the #2 problem with the game: making any sub-optimal move in the game causes you to lose. I have played several types of games where the main interaction is blindly playing your move, then resolving it after everyone has revealed. The mechanic itself is fine, especially if there is enough room for error to make a feint with a slightly sub-optimal move, then capitalize on your following turns. The problem here is that there are at most 10 turns in the game and it's arranged so that a lot of things can happen in one turn. So any attempt at a feint will turn into a game-losing sequence of events. Because of this, the only way to play the game is to always make the statistically optimal move. That means you realistically have very little choice of what to do during your turn. The essence of the game boils down to ""decide what your strategy is before the game starts, always play the optimal move, and hope that your alliances hold and that no one is using a strategy that happens to exploit the weaknesses in your strategy."" If you find that someone has decided on a strategy that your strategy doesn't cover, there is almost no way to make adjustments after the second turn to change your plan. Oh well, you lose. But you're still expected to sit there and go through the motions for another 2 hours.

Since there is almost no way to adjust your strategy effectively once the game begins AND some races are more powerful than other races AND the only viable moves to make on your turn are the statistically optimal moves (giving you very little choice as to what you can play), most of what determines the winner of the game is out of your hands one the game begins. The game feels like everyone made their decisions before it started, then everyone tried to execute their plans more efficiently than everyone else, and everyone hopes that they chose the best plan. Anyone who does not play like this will lose to players who do play like this. Among the players who play like this, the winner is determined by everyone executing their predetermined plans.

Comebacks are not a part of this game. Neither are brilliant tactical decisions. Once a player gets far enough ahead of another player, he continues to get stronger while the other player's strength is reduced by the game rules. Yes, the game rules are designed so that players who are winning will continue to win by an ever-increasing margin as the game progresses.

There is a subset of people who enjoy games that test their ability to decide on a highly optimized strategy. Those people would like this game, because that's the most important skill required to win. I don't like that because it shifts the most important game decisions to a time before the game begins, when you're thinking before you make your first move. I prefer games where your ""in-game"" decisions make the difference.

The secondary skill required to win the game is alliance making. That's fine, but there are many many games that do this part better (and they don't have all the other frustrations that this game has), so I prefer to just play those games.

In addition to these complaints, I will include that the rules are overly complicated, there is a lot of down-time when you're sitting and waiting for other players to do stuff, and the game board was warped out of the box.

As an aside, I'll give you an example of a set of rules that I think feels the same as this game:
- Each player writes ""rock,"" ""paper,"" or ""scissors"" on a piece of paper.
- Each player then chooses either the player to his left or to his right to be the target of his choice.
- The pieces of paper are then revealed.
- Sit around a move a bunch of plastic and cardboard for 20 minutes.
- If you beat your target, you get 1 point. If someone else targeted you and beat you, you get -1 point.
- If you get -1 points 2 turns in a row, you lose, but you can't leave.
- Repeat these steps until all but on person has lost or it has been done 10 times.

If you like that game, you will like A Game Of Thrones. I don't think it's a good game.",1.0

No longer about deep strategy and careful decision-making, the board game is a mad frenzy of everything happening at once where you are actually timed by an app. And the timer is short - like, 15 seconds kind of short. There is absolutely no way to communicate with the other players and formulate a strategy in that amount of time, so the game is really about making a series of bad decisions during a frantic 15-second shouting match, and then seeing how badly you screwed yourselves over. Yes, it builds tension - but in the exact opposite way that a game titled ""XCOM"" should. This is an XCOM game in the same way that a first-person-shooter with thin men would be an XCOM game.

What is not worth is to buy these dices for $12. For $23 you can get the beginner game boxed set that already includes the same dices, plus adventure, small rulebook, maps and tokens. And if you already have the Edge of the Empire beginner box you can get the Age of Rebellion beginner box that will be available in March 2014. You will get a new beginner box, different adventure, maps, tokens and you will get 14 more dices.

So, bottom line: Unless you find these dices for less than $8, you should get the beginner game boxed set instead.",1.0
"The rules are all online & cumbersome to use.  There is no clear explanation on how to win the game while plenty of clear ways to lose.  The app is adequate but the game seems to go on forever with no sense of progression.  My family tried the game twice and got frustrated both times.  Finally gave up and lost interest in playing.

My recommendation is to look at some of the video reviews before you purchase to see if the style of play is to your liking.",1.0

First, it is not new - it is CT-ART 3.0 with Mate Studies added. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it. And they lie on the box and in their web info. I only found out by going to their support site. Which is another nightmare, by the way.

Second, the new interface, Peshk is a Piece of Garbage. I own the software, I bought it, and will be returning it to the USCF. I can't get the thing I bought, CT-ART 4.0 not Peshk, to install or  register it. In fact I can't even tell you where it is. I bought, I remind Convecta, a licensed copy of their software. I didn't buy the right to attempt to endlessly contact their server to get their permission to run something I own. Or endlessly write tech support for help. There is no excuse for this.

It is software from hell. You have no idea what you are supposed to do. Another example of bad programming from ChessNOTOk. Not to mention more bad English.

"I bought this in November, anticipating I would run the experiments with my kids during the summer vacation.  Well, summer vacation is here and I opened the box.  To my surprise, there is no book to explain what to do with the various components. I have an MIT degree, and can sort of figure it out, but the average person will be puzzled by the kit without a few instructions.  Unfortunately, the components are quite cheap, and you'll wind up throwing them away and substituting higher-quality stuff you have around the home.  The components are a lot less expensive looking than the packaging -- so it's entirely possible to throw away nearly then entire kit looking for the materials, not realizing, oh crud, that that part is supposed to be an experiment; it's not packaging waste.

Most things in the kit are stuff the average scientifically literate person has around the house in higher quality for his kids anyway -- the included prism, magnifying glasses, and motor are poor-quality jokes.  And alligator-clip wires?  Seriously, if they included that they should have included the crayons, too -- which the box says you need to run at least one experiment in the nonexistent book. After all, they included a strip of wax paper, some cheap cellophane, and a rubber band. Particularly interesting is that they included two cheapo plastic sample trays, but noted on the shopping list on the box that it was impractical to include two cheapo plastic cups.  Really?",1.0

You can even see what letter is on each tile when they're face down if you're playing in a well-lit area.

The bag has a plain zipper and the logo screenprinted on the side, while the real set has a branded zipper and a trademark sign on their logo. The letters in the set I ordered are printed on lightweight, hollowed plastic; while the pieces on the real game are also on plastic they feel heavier and are centered in each piece.

The inner seal is not broken and the magnets are intact, which is good, but the box is mangled and ripped on the corners and the little seal on the end flap was previously cut through.  And you want the little box because it's cute and you don't want to just give a little plastic sleeve of magnets without context.  I think someone returned it but the vendor did not replace the box.  If it was just for me, I would not care but it is for someone else.  Now, I don't have time to return it and order another because the event is coming up so I'll have some 'splainin' to do in my book club grab bag.

"I don't understand all the hpye this game has gotten.  I bought it for my 14-year old daughter for Christmas, we played it once, and we both agreed to return it.  The problem is that you can create the bigest ""crossword puzzle,"" use the most tiles, and then lose if the other player happens to run out of tiles first.  I suppose we could have made up our own rules, but it didn't seem worthwhile.  We'll stick to Scrabble, Taboo, Pictionary, etc.",1.0
"If I could give negative stars I definitely would.  I purchased this game here first and loved the concept, but the tiles seemed poorly made.  They were made out of plastic and it was hard to handle them.  I didn't think much of it, just thinking that the company opted for cheaper materials.  I grew more suspicious when I noticed the directions and tags seemed scanned and cut out.  My friend has the game as well and her tiles were NOT PLASTIC, and the directions didn't seem like a paper cutout..and the bag had the ""R"" on it..and mine did not.  Not satisfied with the workmanship, I gave my set away.  At Target, I saw the game again and decided to buy it.  This time, the tags seemed more legit and the tiles, were heavier and were easier to handle!!!!

"I have just spoken with the people at Bananagrams, and I found out that the set that I bought last year from Amazon was COUNTERFEIT.  The tiles are cheaper-looking than the ones in another set which was bought from another source earlier.

The reason I checked was that I am preparing to buy several sets as gifts, and I wanted to give the sets with the better-looking tiles, if possible.  The Bananagrams company say that they are making the tiles the same way today as they always have.  They are solid heavy plastic with rounded corners and edges.  The ripoff sets have cheap hollow-back styrene tiles.

The stitching on the banana bag is already falling apart. I'll be returning this counterfeit product.

***AMAZON*** was WONDERFUL in dealing with the return: I was on hold for just a few seconds before my call was connected, and the customer service rep politely and efficiently sent me out a return label so that I can get a refund, plus an Amazon credit code for my trouble. Amazon: 5 stars; Vendor: 0 stars.",1.0
"Apparently they've changed how they manufacture the tiles for this game from earlier versions. What was once more substantial, heavier quality, scrabble-style tiles, is now CHEAP, light, poorly-printed versions. A real shame to down-grade such a previously high-quality, fun product. I was embarrassed to brag on this game and open it up to this.",1.0
"I was really expecting this game to be awesome, but I was majorly disappointed. First of all, when I play a game I enjoy the social intereaction of it. This game is very, well, solo. You don't communicate, there is no competition, and there really isn't much educational value because you are only working with the vocabulary you already know. If you like games that have no competition and you don't have to speak to eachother, then by all means, this is the game for you. Maybe with a large group it would be a little better because you feel more rushed, but I still don't see the appeal in sitting there by yourself making words. I love word games and educational games, but this game is just blah. I'm sorry to those of you that loved the game if this offends you, but we are each allowed to have our own opinions. I personally won't play the game again and just wanted to give that viewpoint so people can see a more complete review of the product. However, I do encourage you to try the game multiple times with different groups of people and try the different rules before judging for yourself. But I wouldn't waste $15 on it, so be sure to play with someone else's set before making a commitment to purchase.",1.0
"I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews.  We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times.  For us, the negatives are: 1) you are essentially playing alone, building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing.  The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too.  2) the child (at least mine) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board, but she's on her own in this game.  Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles doesn't even this out so overt help is needed, which makes it less fun. 3) the child is not learning any new words since they don't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own, so the educational value is less.

If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal-breakers, then I would recommend the game Catch-Phrase which is interactive, educational, fast-paced, and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they don't recognize . (They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people's turns.) We have the card, rather than electronic version. It's a blast.  Kids over on playdates always drag it out, and when we have family over everyone wants to play. This has never happened with Bananagrams.",1.0
"This is the most boring game EVER. I wish I had read the reviews first, I wasted my money. No point value, no competition, you play alone. Hated it. Play Scrabble, Upwords.......both fun. Wish I could give it a negative rating. And yeah Midwest GUY, I know it's for more than one person, you totally missed the point. You don't play against someone. You do all the forming of words for yourself, can't even play off of someone's words. Boring.",1.0
"It isn't very fun, and definitely not social. You aren't really able to talk to one another because you are so focused on the game. It isn't very competitive since there is no timer, turns, or some sort of score. There is almost no rush until the end which is almost coincidental as to who just so happens to have the last piece. There is no educational value considering since you aren't learning any new words, just repeating the same words to finish the game. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. I would highly suggest SCRABBLE, much more fun for a game night.",1.0
"I honestly cannot believe that this game has so many good reviews!  We got it two years ago as a gift and my whole family (a family of game players) tried it.  Oh my goodness!  This is the most antisocial game of all time!  You don't talk to anyone or interact with anyone.  You just work by yourself until someone is done.  I guess in the age of facebook, e-mail, and twitter, this is the game for America.  You don't actually have to be social, yet you can feel good because you are sitting next to someone under the pretense of playing a game ""with"" them.  This game should be played by one person who has nothing better to do.  Don't waste your family time playing this game.  Find something that encourages your family to talk to each other.  That's what we need.",1.0
"Perhaps it is just what others have liked about this game - freedom from scrabble's tyrannical board - is what I disliked about it the most in the end.
I am a huge fan of word games but I think the crucial ingredient in making this particular one fun is the presence of kids/teens. Just adults will find this pretty much a waste of their time even if they are big on word games/crosswords/boggle/scrabble etc.",1.0
"I just bought this item tonight, not at Amazon... it's going back tomorrow.  You can't see a thing in the scope.  Great toy in theory.  Save your money and time and look for another lab kit.  Thats what I'll be doing next!",1.0
The packaging and description are incredibly misleading. This toy is as cheap as they come. It works better as an LED flashlight than a microscope. I would attempt a return but it was given as a gift. I was embarrassed that the child could not resolve an image whatsoever.,1.0
"I let the salesman at the store talk me into buying this although I had low expectations.  I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  It was so incredibly useless.  I put it all back together immediately to return for a refund.  However, I had lost the receipt and I had paid cash.  So we still have it.  My son keeps getting it back out to try to play with it, but then he remembers it doesn't DO ANYTHING!  It is virtually impossible to get the slide to hold steady enough to see anything at all under the microscope.  It is uncomfortable to push the button to hold the light on while you're looking at the slide.  I understood that this was $20 and wouldn't work like an expensive microscope, but I'm telling you, this microscope is the same quality I would expect from a $1 microscope from the Dollar Store.  It is practically unusable because you can't hold it still and it's too hard to find your object under it.  My son plays with the little vial and the tweezers.  Was that worth $20?  No.  Trust me.  Do not waste your money on this.  You and your child will be disappointed.",1.0
"The title tells it all. My husband put it together for our grandson. By the time he had it together, the little boy lost interest. It is flimsy, not easily held and not very appealing. It was a waste of money!",1.0

"This is garbage. Do not waste your money. Yes it's cool for looking at but kids cannot play with it. It's hard to put back together and the organs fall out.

Very disappointed with this item. Pieces made of flimsy plastic and it was upsetting when the plastic forceps broke while just taking them out of the packaging. The children were less interested in the reading material because they could not relate it to the cheap/junky body parts/skeleton.  They quickly moved on to other gifts and never came back.,1.0

If constructed well would be an incredible teaching model for kids.  However....... I am terribly disappointed at the quality and construction.

"What a disappointment.  The concept is wonderful, but the quality is severely lacking.  I got this as a congratulatory gift for a friend and co-worker.  We work at a health insurance company, and thought this would make a cool desk display.  She loved it...when it was in the box... When she attempted to put it together, nothing fit, the front side clear plastic exoskeleton was cracked at the crotch, and the feet didn't even come close to fitting on the base.  While the $30 price tag was a little on the high side for this type of gift, I was so appalled by the poor quality that it led me to believe that Amazon misplaced a decimal point ($3.00 would have been an appropriate pricetag).  This product was of the same caliber as a chuck-e-cheese prize counter trinket.  Gotta go, she needs another kleenex...",1.0
"I hardly ever leave reviews but this product is so bad I had to write in. The pieces are  pain to click together and the tabs that attach the pieces to the frame break easily. I thought it could be a product for the kids but even the adults had trouble getting this together. It's an interesting idea but if you really want to put this together, it's just useless.",1.0
"Probably the worst item I ever bought on Amazon. The pieces don't fit properly and the box is misleading on the pizza part. I watched the video several times before purchasing. Really disappointing I gave this as a gift. If you read reviews, please don't waste your time or monoey.",1.0

Really ""changes the game"" for me!! Very pleased",5.0
"The Wii wasn't meant for Hi-def, but the 480p with the component cables makes the picture much crisper. It definitely worth the value.",5.0
"Works perfectly, exactly as advertised, and I can tell the difference on my 40"" television.",5.0
"...that Nintendo (or Sony, Monster Cable, etc.) can ask so much for things that don't cost nearly so much to manufacture; the name brand cables are probably made in China right alongside these third-party counterparts. $30 was out of the question for me right now, so I figured I'd take a chance on this. 5 or 6 bucks, WITH shipping. It does come in a clear plastic bag with no labeling or instructions, but it's a high-quality cable that performs perfectly. No problems whatsoever (grant it, I've only had it a day, but I don't forsee anything changing as sturdy as it is). The colors are noticably brighter, and to my surprise, everything does appear crisper! As mentioned, just remember to go to Wii Settings and change TV resolution to 480p.",5.0
"I agree with other reviews that the video for gaming is not improved in ""HD"" using a component video cable with your Wii console.  I looked at the bowling game before and after switching, and it looked the same.
I got the disc from Netflix for watching movies on the Wii.  I compared by starting a movie with the original video cable.  The video was fuzzy and just blah on my HD TV.  Paused the movie and switched cables.  Restarted the movie and it looked the same.  Then I realized that I have to go to the Wii set up menu to change from 480i to 480p.  After that the picture was much better.  Netflix ""Instant"" streaming movies now look as good as playing the DVD.  The image is sized to fill my wide screen HD TV.

The cable itself has full sized plugs for video and audio.  On my TV the jack spacing leaves no gap between plugs, making plugging it in tight.  Make sure every plug is fully inserted if you have picture or sound issues.",5.0
Works just as well for $3.02 as the component cable that WII sells for $27.99.,5.0
"for the record, ive only had these cables for about a months or so.
just to address the immediate concern:
the cables are of a quality physical build
they give a much more crisp picture than composite cables, and the quality is just as good as expected.
there are a few problems i have with this item though...
the heads of each wire are FAT. the component ports on my tv are spaced pretty close together, so its hard to fit all the wires into each port. (thats what she said!)
my final gripe with the product is that the packaging it came in was pretty cheap looking. it came in a white box that totally said ""hey...were third party and we know it."" its not that i really care what the stupid packaging for cables looks like, but it just sort of made me question the quality of the product right out of the box.

i will not take off any points for the things i don't like, because i know that peoples real concern when buying cables is picture quality.
YES, these cables are very sufficient in that aspect. i just hope they STAY a good quality and not deteriorate over time. oh and they where affordable too! ;D",5.0

"It's you against the mountain. SSX 3 challenges gamers to drop in and conquer a massive, living mountain rife with ego-crushing challenges and gravity-bending thrills. Sporting an all-new open-ended gameplay structure, gamers are free to ride anywhere gravity takes them, seamlessly boarding from one event to the next as they begin their assault on the mountain's three larger-than-life peaks.

Gamers will need to overcome everything the mountain throws at them-from fierce lightening storms and breathtaking vertical drops to serpentine slope style courses and earth-swallowing avalanches-on their quest for the ultimate adrenaline rush. The mountain presents gamers with a world of open vistas and fresh powder for out of bounds exploration, filled with trick venues, rail parks, racecourses, and half-pipes with new tricks to master and new competitors to leave in the dust.

More than two years in the making, SSX 3 is a massive sequel to SSX and SSX Tricky, the games that started the EA SPORTS BIG brand. Buckle up your bindings as a returning veteran or fresh-faced rookie. Get ready to take on other riders-and the biggest challenge yet-the Mountain itself.

Key Features

Conquer the Mountain: The larger-than-life mountain is your playground, your racetrack and your launch pad. Three massive peaks offer thrilling new opportunities for exploration, competition, and good old-fashioned showboating. Beat all three peaks and you're in for an epic half-hour ride down the face of the entire mountain.

Go Anywhere: No menus. No restrictions. The mountain is an open canvas for gamers to explore-seamlessly ride from event to event, with no load times and no set path for gamers to follow. Hundreds of collectables, secrets, and shortcuts await.

More Tricks: Gamers will have access to a massive arsenal of new Uber Tricks and special moves-from handplants to board presses. A new three-tiered Uber Trick system now includes one-footed Ubers, rail-based tricks and signature moves for each character. A new combo system allows for nearly endless combos that can run the length of the entire mountain.

Characters: Four new characters join six returning favorites. Mac, Elise, Zoe, Moby, Psymon, and Kaori are back, and they're joined by the crazy Swede Viggo, mountain man Nate, 12 year-old phenom Griff, and the talented and sexy Allegra.

Rich, Natural Graphics: A team lead by an Oscar-nominated visual effects artist has created the most immersive, stunning visual SSX experience to date. Capturing moments of both sublime scenic beauty and heart-pounding natural disaster, SSX 3 blends subtle environmental effects like glistening snow and swaying trees with the trademark SSX graphic flash and attitude.

Soundtrack: An adrenaline-charged soundtrack delivers bleeding-edge tracks and tomorrow's hits from artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, N.E.R.D., and many more.

Big Challenges: Gamers will find 150 unique hidden challenges, designed to test their speed, skill and style as they explore untamed backcountry areas.

Customization and Rewards: Win BIG and you'll be rewarded. SSX 3 let's players level up character abilities, win killer gear, stock their trophy room and buy mp3s for personal play lists and much, much more.",5.0

"The product itself is not a problem, just don't expect this to be an easy job to do.  You have to be very technical and there are a lot of tiny wires and many things that can go wrong during the replacement.  I do not recommend this if you do not know what you are doing.",5.0
"My 5 year old son decided to murder my gamepad, and this is EXACTLY what i needed to repair it. The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protector(not a good day for anyone). The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged.

Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the ""bottom"" of the device.

The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing.

In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad. There are no seals to break, or anything that would tip off Nintendo or Gamestop that you've tampered with it, in the event you send it in for warranty or trade it in.",5.0

but what the video I watched DID NOT MENTION, is that if you replace your touch screen with this, then you'll see a very noticeable silver boarder around your screen, that is from the LCD panel it's self.
you'll need your old screen, SO DON'T TROW it out yet, you'll need to pry off the plastic black square (carefully) and place it on your new touch screen.
With this installed, the black square will cover up the silver boarder, and make your tablet look just like when it was fresh out of the box!",5.0

"I have played every Silent Hill game and can honestly say that Silent Hill 3 is the the best looking, has the best presentation, and is the scariest of the series on the PS2.

Visually, the game looks pretty amazing, (even for being 7 years old).  Tons of shadow effects, hi-res texture maps, and some really cool ""crawling"" textures throughout the game.

The story, while not quite on par with the drama of SH2, is still quite interesting (though you may want to start with Silent Hill 1, at the stories are pretty closely linked and make more sense in sequence).

The sound is, as always, amazing.  It is what creates the majority of the fear and panic you will experience.

While the game is on the shorter side compared to the others, I would also argue that it has the most variety.  You will never be bored with/comfortable in any of the environments, (as happened occasionally in the previous games).

The gameplay hasn't changed significantly from the previous 2 games (save for some new weapons, a block move, and substantially fewer bullets and health items than were in SH2), and it isn't particularly ""fun"" to play, but the constantly oppressive atmosphere will steal most, if not all your attention, form this.

My opinion:  Silent Hill is not about fun, it's about being scared, (and you WILL be scared playing SH3)",5.0

"The graphic on the planes are nice even though some of the planes have incorrect features.  The game is good old fun, no intensive brain power required.  I wish there are more operations available but for a few bucks I guess I maybe asking for too much.  You need to look online to find out how to achive the challenges (and scores), there is minimal information in the manu come with the box.  Also, I think they can improve the third person view because right now I have to hold down the C or D key for locking on emermy or self rotate, which is inconvenience while using the joystick.

"I bought this adapter about 10 years ago in 2000 when I got my first PS2.  I purchased it from [...] before it was shut down by Sony.  I used the adapter to play FFXI on my PC with a ps2 pad for over a year and had no problems.  I have a ~$150 Mas Systems Fighting Stick for Playstation that I bought at the same time as the adapter (i.e. almost ten years ago), and have recently used both to play SFIV on my PC, resulting in what I perceive as an [well run] arcade-quality experience.

I've also used it over the years for arcade emulation, specifically MAME32.  Ever wanted to play all the great Neo Geo games like Metal Slug with a PS pad, or the great fighting games like The Last Blade or Samurai Showdown series with your playstation fighting sticks?  This adapter made all of those possibilities easy and like I said I've enjoyed the adapter for almost a decade.

I have never hooked an n64 controller up to it but I only wanted the PS adapter and for $15 it has worked for over 10 years.  I've used it for 10 years now, everything from playing FFXI on a PC with a PS pad (imo the best way to play the game) to MAME32 to SFIV in 2009, and the thing still works perfectly.

"OK First.  This thing works.  100% (With Windows XP and Windows 7, not sure about Vista as I do not have that).

Unfortunately.  If you are not computer savvy, you might not want to buy this product.

What you need:

- Original N64 Controller.  As I write this review, I have ONLY tested the Grey one.
And it works GREAT.  Small note, you might want to clean up your old controllers for them to work their best).

- From your Control Panel, go to Game Controller.  Set up your Original N64 Controller in there.  To do that, Make sure your controller is plugged in, then go to Properties > Settings, then click the ""Calibrate"" button.  Follow the set up.  Remember Up&Down are on the Y Axis and Left&Right are on the X Axis).

- Then you want the newest release of NRage Input Plugin:  [...]

- Take your time reading the NRage Setup page. Really read it.

- To make the Joy Stick work (In the NRage Control), just go to the ""Analog Stick"" section.  Then Up for UP, Down for Down, etc...  Remember to input your other buttons as well.  Finally save your control settings!

If you think this is complicated, well, it can be.  There are lots of forums out there to help.  The best bet though is to go to the link I have posted above.

Good Luck!

UPDATE 9/29/2011:  It has been a few years and it is still working great.  I now have it hooked up to my new Window 7 Desktop computer (which is running through my HDTV).  I just followed the same steps as when I had it hooked up to my old comuter with Windows XP.

As I can se the buoyage system is now improved.
Excellent ship simulator.",5.0
So I got this and first it was kind of tedious but then I added weather and well the titanic in a hurricane can be a hoot I got 08 cause my laptop is horridly slow but when I get my hands on more computer power I'm going to get ship simulator extremes you tube gives you a good idea what to expect check it out there and see if its for you,5.0

"The most amazing graphics you could see! If you own a flight simulator yoke and/or throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier.

"I have not used all of this simulator's features yet, but I am very pleased.  I think that it is a good buy.  I have had lots of fun just cruising around in the different boats and have only scratched the surface.  I have not attempted any of the missions yet, but there seems to be a good variety of them.  I think that this is a very cool product.  It would be even better with a joystick, which I do not currently have, but is not too hard to control with the keyboard and mouse.  It gives you both a cockpit view and a birds-eye view, which is nice.  I think that it is a good investment if you wish that you were behind the helm of a boat (or ship)!",5.0
"I think this game is awesome. I like the detail of the waves, and the water splashing on boards. However, I do think that they should have put a big cruise ship and a yacht and a fishing boat in the classic Ship Simulator 2008, instead of in an expansion pack (New Horizons) that costs and extra $48.00. Overall I think it is a good game though.",5.0
This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it. I do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy it.,5.0

"This RPG gaming system has become my favorite, I still love AD&D 1e and Call of Cthulhu, but this system combines both of what I love about both of those.  The book is a little smaller than I thought it would be, the artwork is beautiful, this book is written for adults 18 years or older.  I will still play AD&D and Call of Cthulhu as well.  Here is a quote I have taken form the Lamentations of the Flame Princess website that shows that you can use this rpg gaming system with a lot of different gaming systems.  ""Rules-wise, LotFP belongs to the ""Old School Renaissance"" family of games that uses the Open Game License to recreate game rules of the late 70s/early 80s, with LotFP's particular twisting of those rules flattening out the power level a bit and emphasizing a more horrific and go-for-the-throat attitude. A PDF version of the full rules without any of the game's artwork is available here for you to use for your own purposes. (The full-version PDF includes all of the art, while the physical version is a beautiful high-quality artifact in its own right.)
Being part of the Old School Renaissance also means that every LotFP adventure and supplement is readily compatible with over 100 other RPGs, and their support material is readily compatible with LotFP.""",5.0
Well worth the price.,5.0
Great Product. Very fun.,5.0
"This is an excellent and streamlined take on Dungeons and Dragons, with a weird horror vibe- which is mostly conveyed by the beautiful and horrific artwork.  Much less fiddly rules to get in the way of your gaming experience, yet it has everything you need to make a great game.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"Strange, weird, violent, inappropriate for children, old-school, fabulous art especially of powerful female characterizations of the Flame Princess of course, the others are just weird.

Would recommend getting at least one introductory adventure to go with the rules. If you want the fully intended impact of the gods awful vibe intended.

Otherwise just roll your own and make your own genre riff off these dark and occult rules.",5.0

"I really like this product especially for the price! I didn't expect it to be all that great for the price at first, but it fits the bill just perfect. It makes the controller very grippy so sweaty hands is no longer a big issue!

I have 3 of them over all, 2 black and one yellow, and the black looks much better than the yellow, you cannot see the case as well on the black unlike the yellow, the yellow is semi transparent so the black of my controller is visible still, but that doesn't bother me;

"I bought this from amazon seller likeelectronic Ship FM Hongkong for under $3 shipped.

The one I got fits the controller excellently! Smooth rubber, it feels very comfortable while playing games, you don't even notice it.  My hands sweat a LOT during Call of Duty hours sessions without this case on it, adding this onto my controller pretty much has eliminated that.  Great Case from seller above.",5.0

"This has to be the best thing I have invested in for my Xbox gameplay.  I ordered this quite afraid that the product I was going to receive was going to match the price I paid for it and that it would not work at all! I have never been so wrong... As soon as I slipped the extremely easy silicone case over my controller I noticed a big difference. The A,B,X,and Y buttons were noticeably lower to the controller before. This instantly turned me off of the case because I thought it would lessen my ability to press these buttons. As soon as I started playing borderlands 2 everything changed, I could no longer feel the difference between the button height and instantly my horrible gaming palms (my palms get quite sweaty when gaming) started to sweat up the controller. I noticed the silicone, unlike the controller, did not slip move from my grip, somehow it let the moisture from my hands evaporate and my sweaty palms were continuing to play the game effortlessly. About 2 hours through the best gaming session of my Xbox carrier, I noticed I hadn't slipped, moved, or wiped my palms once! This is such an amazing product and I just now bought 2 more for my friends to use. I cannot believe that such an amazing product could be sold for such a small amount of money, if you play xbox and do not have this case, you are seriously missing out and need to buy this right now!",5.0
"I really like this skin. It makes the controller nicer to play with, and looks nice as well.
Yes, i would recommend this to a friend.",5.0
very cool case for controler it keeps it from being icky and keeps it clean....non slip and very confortable for the hand and very easy to use.,5.0
The price isn't bad for a great silicone skin that fits your xbox 360 controller. It streches so it would fit perfectly and it keeps dust out. If your hands get sweaty while playing a game this silicone skin has an awsome grip so the controller won't slip.,5.0
"I bought two of these for two of my Xbox 360 controllers, and I'm certainly glad I did. They look great, reduce the buildup of dead skin cells in the grooves around the controller (which always bothers me), provide grip and comfort. I can't say these will improve your gaming skills, but they certainly don't hurt them.

I was concerned that they might get in the way of my KontrolFreeks: FPS Freeks VIPR stick extensions, but they are just fine and require no modification. They fit the controller quite snugly, and provide just a small bit of cushion for your hands.

The excess silicone seam around the skin from the molding process is just the slightest bit more uncomfortable than the groove that is already in the controller, but this is easily remedied with a hobby knife blade (X-acto). Just carefully trim off the excess material until it's smooth and then enjoy the comfort!

I have more controllers and plan to buy more skins for ALL of them!",5.0
I like that give lill more grip cause I have puppies and they ruff house arond me always knocking the controler out of my hands ... I was afraid the brake the controler but now its lill more secure ... it does cling lill to there fur but brush it off your ok ... but this was not the reason I got it I bought it cause my consoul was blak and all of my controlers were white and it was bugging me this was perfect solution,5.0
"I play Xbox almost everyday, and frequently for hours at a time. For the price, you can't beat this. I find it easier to hold onto the controller, especially during intense COD matches. It's easy to slip right on and after about 1 1/2 months of use, it's still holding up well and stays in place with no issues.",5.0
"There is nothing fancy or even necessary about having this skin for the controller other than added comfort, but my son (who I bought this for) liked it.",5.0
"Couldn't believe what a difference it made in the grip and feel of the controller with the ""glove"" on it.  Great product, well worth ordering.  Don't want to be without one.",5.0
"As soon as I slipped this on my controller, I knew that I'd never take it off!!  It makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands, and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingers!",5.0
"This is a good buy but... if you get the thumb grips for the xbox 360 controllers they will get stuck on the silicone so its not like the picture and it shows at the joystick the silicone is way back its really up close to the sticks and you will have to cut it back IF you get the thumb grips, now it could just be only my silicone case but I don't know.",5.0
I'm revising my earlier review. i had only rated my transaction 3 stars previously due to shipping problems. After the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem I have to reconsider. They contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy. Thank you. This was the second case I've purchased and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks again.,5.0
"This thing is so inexpensive and makes the controller much more comfortable to hold for hours on end. Item is very well manufactured and fits like a glove. It also helps your hands breathe a little bit if you have sweaty hands. For less than the cost of a gallon of gas You can't not afford to get this thing! Better grip, looks sharp, and is thin enough that it does not make the controller more bulky in anyway.",5.0
"Every place I looked compared the PS3 Turbo Fire Wireless Controller controller to the 360 controller. I figured this skin would fit no problem. After a few modifications to it, it fits the controller, although not perfectly. Very smooth feel, and helps prevent sweaty palms when playing. Highly recommend for the 360 controller.",5.0
"The silicone protective cover for Xbox controlers helps very much with your grip , which is important when playing Xbox!",5.0
"easy to put on and take off, good grip, cheap price, just don't rip it apart to see how strong it is and write a review about it and it's be fine :D",5.0
"So I ordered this because I just felt that I always got my controller ""dirty"" and I felt that I should buy  a very clean case.

This case it absolutely AMAZING!

It's just what I ordered and is very sleek and clean but not only that! I also got a nice coupon for five dollars off for a purchase over 25 dollars and that is always nice to have.

I thank you guys again for having such a nice product and I do recommend to get this piece of materiel for your Xbox 360 controller.  :)

"Awesome sillcone cover for my xbox 360 controller. Fits well, but collects dust sometimes.",5.0
"Just plain awesome! Yea, it's a lot to say for a simple piece of silicon but what a difference it makes on the feel of the controller. The controller feels more stable in my hand an less (in fact not even) prone to slipping, dropping, etc. Definitely worth purchasing.",5.0
"Great buy, and even better for the price.  I ordered 2, and paid just under $6 shipped.  The covers are a bit slick to the touch right out of the package, but once you use them for 10 or 15 minutes take on a very rubbery, grippy feel.  The cover fits very snug to the controller, and doesn't seem to shift around inside at all.  Also, the cover doesn't block the battery, headphone jack or charging cords at all.  I would have liked this cover at the $10 price other places charge, but for just under $3 it is awesome.",5.0
"The silicone case fits great and is comfortable.
If you share a controller with others, you will like the cleaner feel of this case. It doesn't get ""clammy"" felling.",5.0

"this xbox controller cover is great. its feels great on my hands and adds additional grip. its also easily modified if it doesn't fid just right because you can just cut off pieces with a pair of scissors. it also protects the outside of your controller from the dirt and grime that builds up. my friends always comment on my controller when the pick it up. they always say ""why does you controller feel so good"" I would definitely recommend this cover",5.0
"Easy install and feels great. The skin fits really well and functions properly. I did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while I used them, but after that it was perfect.",5.0
"Feels much better than the controller itself, and protects the controller well. I initially got 1 of these and used it for a few months then got another one for my other controller because it was so good.",5.0

"I use this on my white wireless 360 controller and the grip it adds is phenomenal. My hands usually sweat during long play periods, but not with this on. It feels great and is fun to play with while your waiting for your game to load. Installation is VERY easy and took me about 10 seconds. Outstanding grip!",5.0
"Grips the controller amazingly, great for long gaming sessions as your hands get sweaty and hot during those times. The cover literally wicks it away, feels very rubbery, yet thin enough to be really comfortable!! I simply love it, it can get dirty since it catches dust rather easily, nothing a little simple green and a wipe can't take care of. 5 stars, this product is absolutely needed, wish the consoles came with it, out of the box!",5.0
"This is a surprisingly great product for the price. Although I do not know how it would look on a white controller, it is nearly invisible with my black controller. Furthermore, it gives you a really comfortable feel as well as great protection for the controller.",5.0

nice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try one,5.0
Love the holder! Each holder has slots for 16 games. Very compact. It's only about a 4 inch square and about 1 inch thick. Best thing I ever bought to house all my kids games. They snap in and out easily. Great organizer to make sure all the games get put back when not in use.,5.0
"This really beats lugging around those game cases your games came in and you can carry so many more in less space. I already had some of these that only hold six games, I really bought these for a present. I know she will love them.",5.0
Fits well and the price isn't bad. I constantly had to wash hands with Dawn because i hated the way the controller would feel after a few rounds of Call of Duty. Now it doesn't matter. Low profile and doesn't bulk up controller.,5.0
"I love this thing, It makes your controller look badass and is so soft.  It has a great feel to it, way better than plastic, even if you have a Black controller this will improve it.  The seams on the side are my only tiny concern.  Add this with the Grip-it, blue analog covers and you have a great controller for cheap.  I can`t say enough about the comfort.  fantastic!",5.0
"Considering its just a rubber cover for the XBOX 360 controller, actually, it's made well...and the price--not bad at all. Excellent product for an excellent controller.",5.0
"This product is great not only does it protect the controller from getting dirty and damaged but it also gives it a new look. The fitting is not perfect(the pre cut holes are off by a really small fraction)but then again it is an aftermarket piece ,it still stays in place in place during game play which in my opinion is the most important thing. I would recommended this product to any 360 owner",5.0
This is a nifty skin for the 360 controller. I really like the feel and grip of this skin.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and it doesn't show any signs of wear. I did have to cut a little of the skin away around the analog sticks because I use stick extensions.,5.0
"I didn't know if I should buy this, but I had a gift card so what the heck.  I put it on my new controller, and it works well.  I was concerned my hands might get sweaty, but they didn't.

"I just wanna review out something no ones said yet.

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!

Convinced the PC versions better? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking, huh?",1.0

Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!",1.0

"Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes.  The graphics are terrible, the music is annoying and it's just boaring.",1.0
"I guess I'm the first one to say this, but - this game is drab. I've played and loved all Miyamoto games, eg Super Mario I, Zelda I, Zelda II, Mario World, Zelda III, Star Fox, Yoshi's Island, Ocarina of Time, Lylat Wars, and still do, so I should know... Mario 64 is only 'worthwhile' because it's free with the N64 (in the good old times you got Super Mario World!), it looks fab (""Look, it's Mario in 3D!"") at first and - well, that's it, I'm afraid. The levels are mediocre, the control method is awkward, especially compared to the likes of Zelda 64 or the 2D Mario games, and there's a serious lack of depth in the gameplay department. But it's not just Mario 64; it's the trend in videogames at the moment I resent. Everything has to be three-dimensional, graphically amazing, crammed with special effects and cinematic stuff, and it makes me sick. The only thing I care about is  D E P T H  O F  G A M E P L A Y.

"I purchased the product from Amazon and received it with excitement to play this game that I had heard and read so much about.  I loaded the game and enjoyed what I saw.  The second time I went to play it, I got an error  stating that there was a disk error and that my computer could not read it.  I called the technical support about the situation and was told that it  was my computer that was having the problems.  Heaven forbid there game  have the problem.  Isn't funny how everything else on the computer works  great except for when that game is loaded.  He told me that it was most  likely a problem with my CD-ROM drive.  I asked if there was another CD-ROM  drive that I could get to run this game, and his answer was that they were  having problems with all types and that he could not recommend one.
I  was basically told that I am out of luck and in the meantime, I am also out  the $30.  I guarantee that this is the last time that I purchase a product  of this manufacturer.  They will not stand by their product and when you  have problems; it's, thanks for your money, now don't bother me.

I  exchanged it immediately and got another copy of the same game, only to  find after the first time this one had the exact same flaw. Other than  that, this is a really fun game.

"I'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out, with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity.  I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person.  Sure,  Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year.  I  turned out to be one of the latter people.  No matter how hard I tried, I  could never get the income to come out positive.  So, I did what any  distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes!  An hour  later, I was bored.  If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000  out.  But, if you're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words,  try Dungeon Keeper 2, a game like Simcity 3000, but not as complex (and  more active!).",1.0

"This game is an unbelievable disappointment.  Sim City 3000 is basically Sim City 2000 with some graphics improvements and a few new features, which only slightly change the game play.

"I was a big fan of sim city 2000 and Sim City 3000 I am not. What sim city 3000 does is make me want to play sim city 2000!(yuch) That is an awful feeling after plunking down the $$'s. All I can say is that I know this game is a big compromise to the original intentions of the designers. if you  remember Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, by bullfrog, you know exatly what I  mean and how I feel about the crapyness of Sim City 3000.
IF SIM CITY  2000 DID NOT EXIST I would have rated Sim City 3000 31/2-4 stars.",1.0
"The game is very addictive this is true, It has the potential to be great, however don't expect to do all the things it claims.  Yes you have the option to buy houses in the game but the land space is limited and there is  simply no more room for them.  Yes you can use a meriod of skills but you  are limited to how many and how high you can get them.  Skill gain is slow  and mindlessly reparative, yes some skills can be raised while adventuring  but most are raised by siting there and performing the same action over and  over. You'll spend long periods of time building skill.  Skills points are  raised in increments of .1% 100% being the goal and at the higher levels it  can take many hours to gain just  .1% and you can be banned for using an  outside program to macro skills.  The mechanics of the game change from  month to month this is due to the constant tinkering by the administrators  at times it'll be like playing a beta.  Grand improvements are slow  (they've been promising necromancy for two years) while minor changes are  added and removed at an annoying rate(things like the way skills are gained  and weather offensive magic can be used in town ,that one changed 3 times).  Finally in-game support is there for only the most miniscule of problems  (you get stuck in a server crack and can't move) but for most anything else  the game masters are useless and right down rude.",1.0

"Without a doubt one of the worst games I've ever played. There is no creativity or excitement, nothing that makes you want to play more. You fight the same, boring enemies over and over in large numbers. All they do is bum rush you or occasionally throw a snowball. The AI in this game is a complete joke. Music is horribly forgettable, overall sound is okay. Graphics are bland and level designs look like they all were developed and programmed in a weekend. Each main character has a bit of in-game dialogue, and it quickly becomes repetitive and stale. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW ANNOYING THE TURKEY SOUNDS ARE.

Once you peel away the South Park appeal, there is very little left to stand on its own. I endured playing this for maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom. I can see why nobody ever talks about this game. Let's leave it that way.",1.0

"I don't get why so many people rate this a high game. There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.

For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.

WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.

The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.

It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.

Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World",1.0
"I get it, it was one of the first games from PS1 but sincerely, this game is horrible. Looking back on it, the gameplay is stale, the graphics look okay, the action and moves are lame. Miracle is that this game didn't get bashed as it could have been.",1.0
"After reading these reviews, i had to scroll up to make sure we we're talkin about the same game. This has to be the worse wrestling game ever made. 3/4 of the fighters are just some random people, which from their names and faces, i thought was hilarious. But when you fight, you can pretty much only punch and kick and do one special move occasionally. However, the opponent doesn't seem to have this problem, whereas they kick your ass 20 different ways. I'm sure I'm not getting the strategy of this game, but i don't need strategy to put this game in and tell it's the worst game my playstation has ever tasted.",1.0

"Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.

You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.

You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)

Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.

I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.

Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.",1.0
"DIDN'T WORK. So pissed, bought a whole PS1 setup to play this game and it didn't work :( It was too cheap for me to waste my time returning it but I was so mad (the 2 other games I bought did work).",1.0
"Augh! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3. It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next. This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or... hell, I don't know. I just had to repeat the level because it wouldn't let me continue.
Also, there is no giant screen where you can save. You have to find the bonus platform, and make it all the way through the bonus part to save. Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus? Sorry! You're just going to have to hope you don't die or else you'll have to repeat EVERYTHING. OVER. AGAIN.
A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him. Be nice to your children. Buy them Crash 2. Or 3. Or games from the Spyro series, that would work too.
If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it's dirt cheap to buy.. (haha) Put the money towards something BETTER.",1.0

"Though the game is very appealing in regards to its visual style, the controls are abyssmal.  In level 1-3 at the end of the level, you are required to perform a ""whack-a-mole"" type game in order to get the last gobbo.  Since the controls (or uncontrols) are glitchy at best and unplayable at worst, the game begins to not be a game and more of a nuisance.  The analog versus digital controls have no bearing to eachother and you find yourself toggling back and forth just so you can have some margin of control.  A game to avoid by any standard.",1.0

"As a child I adored the Croc game, so just the other day I picked it back up to have another go. Oh my goodness, no amount of nostalgic fondness can save this thing.
The graphics aren't great but you really can't complain about that as this game dates back to the 90's, but by Playstation One standards it does pretty well. The story is sweet and the characters are endearing (Croc makes cute noises and the fuzzy little Gobbos are adorable). The levels and puzzles are simple but of an appropriate difficulty for a child. The music is probably the best thing about this game as it is light, catchy and matches the atmosphere. So with all that it has going for it why am I ranking Croc so low? The gameplay. Oh dear God the gameplay.
The controls for this poor game are so terrible that it's nearly unplayable. In the very first area I died several times simply trying to jump over a small pit. Even walking poses a serious and frustrating challenge. The controls go from being unresponsive to overly sensitive seemingly at will meaning that Croc will more than likely not jump when you tell him to or completely overshoot his target, usually resulting in a death. The enemies regenerate in under 30 seconds, and considering that it takes you about that long just to turn around there is almost no point in killing them.
This game could have been great, it has all the elements of a charming and worthwhile children's game, but when even walking around is a serious problem there is little to no enjoyment that you or your child will derive from this game. Save your money and stick to Spyro.",1.0
"Unless you still have a PS 1 and like it, the game sucks. Bought it for my Son(5) and playing it on a PS2.

LOL, yes, lots of old games but my son is 5, so let him scratch or kill the game on accitent, same as the PS2, it's not a big Deal. But for now it helps him to learn to handle games and take care of stuff. And the games are cheap, since some PPL always think they have to have the Newest. Thanks to those, like this we have fun for less.
Sincerely,

I have been a huge fan of the Resident Evil games since the late 1990s. I have been looking for Resident Evil 2 for a while now and when I saw the price and the condition it was supposed to be in I had to buy it. The game played excellent and there were virtually no scratches on both discs. Disk 2 (Claire) would freeze at a certain point in the game everytime I played it. It would go to a black screen but you could still hear the music. This was the first time I had EVER ordered anything on Amazon and with my luck the game was defect. I was extremely disappointed being such a huge fan of the Resident Evil games and I have already lost my trust in Amazon.,1.0

"This game is horrible. First, I bought this video ""game"" because I thought it was fun. Well in wasn't. 1st, the graphics are poor. 2nd the computer's difficulty level is so hard. If you play with one, two, or three people, you always lose. The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be, and it just degrades from the fun factor. So ignore the reviews that say it is so great. They are overexxagerating. My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours.",1.0

"Who created this game and why? I get the concept and it's a really good one. Then why did I give it one star? This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you! You should try Chef's Luv Shack, it's based on the same concept but you can actually win the mini-games once in a while.",1.0
"This game doesn't work,I bought it used...it was packaged very well though...We have a very upset son here....I am letting you know so that you can test the games before you send them to other people...",1.0
"I bought Mario Party used for nearly twenty bucks, and it was a total waste (I've since exchanged it for two games I love). The favorable reviews here were what suckered me into buying Mario Party, by the way. Whether you're playing solo or with a group, there is NO skill required in this game. The game rolls the die for you each turn, and the steps you move on the board are obviously based on those rolls. Traditionally, a player plays a game. In Mario Party, the game plays you, and therefore, you have little to no control over how the game unfolds. A game without skill is a game best left unplayed. At least, that's my belief. This game spawned at least six sequels; I'm sure it's because people wrongfully assume that everything Mario-related is heaven-sent. Avoid this game. I'm not too keen on N64 games in general, but there were a few nice ones. Laugh if you want, but Pokemon Puzzle League was one of those few. It has some beautiful FMV scenes in between each round beaten, hand-drawn anime backgrounds during the in-game puzzle portion, and tons of side games. I'm not a big fan of the show, but I do recognize when a game has a lot of time and effort put into it. Mario Party isn't one of those kinds of games.

I'm glad I returned Mario Party for Rayman 2 and Pokemon Puzzle League.",1.0

"...in more ways than one.  Besides the overall poor quality of the game, there was that camera!  Honestly, whoever designed that thing needs to be smacked with a wet fish.
I played levels 1 through 10, and then had to stop just before the end of the game because I was nauseated and had an eyestrain headache.  I am not exaggerating.
The camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still, and to sit still when you need it to move.  The grainy, pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost, but also very hard on the eyes.  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something, that's when things really get bad.  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps, so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith.  The other problem is his feet.  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps, that 9 times out of 10 you will miss a platform because his feet won't plant on it.  And, when he does land, he won't stop running, which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again.
The other problem is the camera angles when walking around something.  When you walk around to the other side of a large object, for some idiotic reason, the camera does not follow you.  As a result, you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you can't see Flik on the other side.  Now, as if that situation is not bad enough, picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen, or being hit by an enemy that you can't see because the camera won't move.  Instead of turning with you, you must stop for about 5 seconds after turning to allow the camera to ""catch up.""  At the same time, the camera has a tendency to turn even while you're just running straight ahead in a single direction, which results in you being completely reversed.  It's completely disorienting, and with the bland, nearly identical levels, you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently.
It's all fun and games, until you've developed a tension headache trying to look at the bad graphics and camera angles, and flung your controller across the room because you just don't feel like attempting that same jump for the 89th time.  Please, stay away from this one.  Don't become an accomplice to anymore game companies trying to cash in on a movie franchise.",1.0
"This game is one of the worst games that Disney Interactive ever created. When you first put it in and see the movie you think that it will be great but then you have only 2 level choices Training and Anthill. I like Training better than Anthill but it still stinks. Also the game freezes too often. When I was on the 5th Level the one where you hop on the dandelion and get across the Canyon without the bird killing you. I was across the canyon and then the game froze and I had to start over and that was the level that I always have trouble with that level.
Another thing that bugs me is that the stupid worm takes about 100 red berries to kill and only 4 blue berries 2 green, and purple berries. And it still takes two gold berries to kill it!!!
Same thing with the one bug that guards the fence takes 100-150 reds 6 blues 3 green 2 purple and 2 gold and that ticks me off really bad. This game stinks and you definetly DO NOT want to buy this game.

"The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult.

"Okay I'm not totally lowbrow, I can get puzzles (I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse). I couldn't get this at all when I played it, not even a bit. You roam around this island getting fragmented information, and at least on the computer the puzzle hit-detection seemed weak, so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor. The puzzles themselves were bad enough, but the fact that solving some of them didn't seem to change anything discernible (at least in the early stages of the game) meant I ultimately gave up in frustration.  Not to mention it wasn't even fun.

Instead of this, I'd recommend Okami or any other hybrid puzzle-rpg.  If you can't figure out the puzzle with the tools possessed, you can at least take out your frustrations on a hapless creature in battle.",1.0
