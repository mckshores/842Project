"I've read this book already and I've got plans for using it in future projects.  I'm DELIGHTED with the patterns in it and the advice and suggestions are just as good as you would expect from Melissa Leapman.  I'm so glad that I bought this.  As a lifelong and addicted knitter, this has been a valuable addition to my already good sized book collection.  Thanks Melissa for this very special knitting treat.",5.0
Nicely written directions.,5.0
"Good additional knitting reference to have available in an electronic format.  I like that it is easy to jump from one bit of information to another, since I was not sure if all the links to topics would be available in a Kindle format.",5.0
"A gazillion pattern stitches, lucidly explained. Illustrations for each one on the same page as its instructions. A very thorough guide to basic techniques in an appendix. You won't get full patterns here, but the stitches are easily adapted to straightforward knitting projects on both straight and circular needles. A very useful book.",5.0

Thank you  very much.",5.0

Love all the patterns in this book.  Made a scarf with one of the patterns.,5.0
"Super useful for designers.
I felt it complemented the Vogue Stitchionary well by having a lot in here that isn't in those volumes.  I actually like this even one better overall.",5.0
Loved it. Different than the usual squares.,5.0
Awesome book!!! A must have!,5.0
Lots of stitches.,5.0
"Easy to follow along, well written and written from the perspective of the knitter not the author.",5.0
"I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.

This gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.

This also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.
Here, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!
One of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.

This is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.
While I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.

Until that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.

This is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.",5.0
Love this- I use it all the time.,5.0
Arrived as promised.,5.0
"I already own a few paper books with stitching patterns, but they all suck so hard I am desperate enough to turn to digital books here. This one is really good. Instructions are pretty clear, there are charts and written instructions both, and the patterns are beautiful. I was trying to knit a sweater for my cat (he gets cold often and is not against wearing something warm), but I am a beginner knitter and before purchasing this book I completely butchered 4 patterns, just couldn't either understand the over-complicated (or not detailed) enough instructions from other books, so the patterns went wrong. Then I used Melissa's book, and knitted the sweater with not one, but two beautiful patterns! Now I feel like this book is gonna be my go-to for knitting patterns for a long while :)",5.0
"The Knit Stitch Pattern Handbook is an excellent stitch dictionary, but it is more. I have other stitch dictionaries, but this is the first one I've bought that shows both the public side and the private side of many of the stitch patterns. Melissa has provided both text and chart representations of the stitch patterns. I don't buy very many craft e-books because I find them to be cumbersome and inconvenient to work from; however, the author provides links to PDFs of each of the stitch patterns individually so that the knitter can print the paper version out to work from. Yes, I agree that some of the patterns are common to many stitch dictionaries, but a good many are unique to this book. The appendices to this book are very helpful. I like this book very much.",5.0
Very beautifully done book.  Wonderful photos of each stitch.  Great instructions.  Lots of fun to see all of those great patterns.,5.0
Great book for beginners and experts.,5.0
This book is great! It does not have as much lace as I'd like but it is otherwise superb.,5.0
A book with traditional and new knitting stitch patterns for the budding knitwear designer or professional.,5.0
Love it!,5.0
I just love Melissa Leapman.  I have all her books and that is just another good one.,5.0
"Great book.  I am really glad I got this.  Lots of great stiches with very clear instructions.  I recommend this for anyone who knits.  It's my ""go to"" book.",5.0
"I can't believe how many patterns are in this book that I have never seen before, and believe me, I have been buying lots of knitting books in the last five years ever since I learned to knit. I don't know what pattern to make first!",5.0
Great book.,5.0
"This book is just what the doctor ordered my wife loves it as it has given Margaret clear and easy instruction to knitting pattens.

  We have it as a hard back and also as a eBook which fantastic.

  All of you knitters out there enjoy!",5.0
Great addition to any knitter's library!,5.0
"Well organized, helpful headings, clear directions, good illustrations",5.0
"Oh my goodness, you will not be disappointed when you get this book home.  So many varieties of stitches!  This handbook puts the stitches into categories, then within the category the stitches are arranged in order of difficulty (easiest listed first, followed by the ones that require a bit more concentration.  Jam packed with useful information and tips, as well.  I consider this pattern handbook a great addition to my ever growing collection of 'knittery' books.",5.0
This is a fine workshop manual.  Get the needles and work each new stitch and technique.  You will accomplish magic.,5.0
"There are a lot of stitch dictionaries out there, and every serious knitter ought to have several -- including this one.

Leapman has chosen a wide variety of stitches, simple to complex, from old favorites to exciting new ones, and has set them out both in line-by-line instruction and in charts with good-quality color photographs of each stitch.

What makes ""The Knit Stitch"" a must-have is that many of the pattern photos show both the ""right side"" and ""wrong side"" of the finished work. Anyone who makes scarves, blankets, or other items in which both sides of the knitting are routinely displayed when it's in use will find this an absolute godsend in designing.

The only quibble I have with the book is that I would have preferred the charts to be bigger. However, like many knitters, I prefer to work from a photocopy in order to save my original from wear and tear, so a quick enlargement of the charts resolves that issue nicely.

Good investment for the beginning knitter and nice addition to the experienced knitter's reference collection. Well worth the price.",5.0
It has motifs and inventive stitches involving crotchet in tandem with knitting stitches I have ever come across. Truly inspiring.,5.0
this stitch library does not disappoint!! you had me at 2 color cables!!! thrilled to add this amazing book to my library!!,5.0
"Very well laid out and very easy to read.

This book is also a nice size, not too big, but larger enough to use and see what is being presented.
Fair price for the product.",5.0
"It's been years since I've gotten excited about a stitch dictionary, but when I opened this today WOW.  I have 5 or 6 and many of them have the same stitches over and over (and over), but this one has many I've never seen before (of course, doesn't mean they're new, just not in any of the books I already have).  And even better, many I really love and want to try.  I've been in a bit of a knitting funk for the last month, (tired of  knitting because I'm tired of being cold maybe?) but now I'm totally inspired to do something I've never done before - swatch, swatch, swatch.  Maybe enough to wind up with a nice lap warmer for next winter.  And I really, really love that Ms. Leapman included instructions on how to shape in pattern - seems pretty easy from her explanation and I might even try designing one for next fall/winter.

Can't wait to get started - thank you, Ms. Leapman for bringing back my knitting mojo!",5.0
"The thing I most like about this collection of stitches is that there's little duplication with another stitch collection I have. The pictures are clear and the instructions well-written.

If brief usage descriptions for the patterns were included, this would be ideal. But that doesn't detract from the book's overall usefulness.

I've already started a project based on one of the stitches in the book. I'm sure I'll be making more as I progress. I use a Knook hook to knit and there are limited pattern books for this, so I really like the useful stitches I've found here.",5.0
I think this book is brilliant I absolutely love.  I think it is the most interesting knitting pattern book I have ever had.  There are so many new and interesting stitches in there.,5.0
Melissa Leapman shows knitters multiple stitch designs in clear pictures of the knitted pattern and easy to use charts for every design.,5.0
"Do not hesitate to buy this book. I have been knitting for 25 years and have collected stitch pattern dictionaries from the beginning. Even so, this book contains many new and beautiful stitch patterns which I had not seen before. I am so pleased with it. I design a lot of my own socks and this book has many, many new patterns which are going to be perfect for that.",5.0
"Beginning her career as a freelance knitter, Melissa Leapman has designed her own collection of wonderful stitch patterns. Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.

All patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, ""how to do basic stitches,"" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.

If you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.

Enjoy and get out the highlighter and notes. You're going to need them.",5.0
"This is a terrific stitch handbook (and I have a few). What sets it apart from it's competitors:

1. Shows which patterns are good on both sides including pictures of both sides
2. Pictures are in color and show good detail
3. Better descriptions, many include how much ""ease"" or ""give"", especially useful to sock knitters.
4. Written instructions AND charts for every pattern and a good explanation of how to use charts.

I have the 365 calendar (good pictures, no charts, no description of fabric characteristics) and an aged copy of the Mon Tricot and various adds to pattern and instruction books but this is far superior to anything I've accumulated before.",5.0
"When I received the book and looked at the cover I thought it looked intresting BUT then opening it and started to read
and look at the patterns ,it is really a fabulous book ,I have a lot of stitch pattern books , But this is the best I have ,I hope
Mellissa will bring out a few more .THANK YOU  wendy r pearce",5.0
The knitting book is excellent for planning different sweaters and scarves etc. Love this book. Most useful book I have.,5.0
"This is one of those books that you savor every page and can't wait to try the amazing patterns. There are some amazing cable patterns. And I especially love the ""awareness ribbon"" and the ""x marks the spot""",5.0
"I really am enjoying this book! I like the size of the book itself, I love the patterns which are providing new grist for the creativity mill. The instructions, both charted and written are clear and well thought out. I like that you can see both the right side as well as the wrong side. I guess that I like everything about this book.

I'd love to see the same format with more 'regular' stitch works. I'm so pleased that I happened upon this book thanks to an Amazon recommendation in my email!",5.0
"Great patterns, and I love that the book is available for my Kindle library.  I recommend the book for those inexperienced knitters or those who are looking for new stitches.",5.0
I really love this book.  Knitting is not my favorite pastime but with these new stitches it certainly is gaining on my crocheting,5.0
"Just received this book and looked over it cover to cover. Each pattern has written and charted instructions and the photos are lovely.  The book contains Textured Knit and Purl Patterns, Lace and Openwork Patterns, Cables and Crossed Stitch Patterns, Slip Stitch Patterns, and Novelty Stitch Patterns.  There is also information on shaping knits within pattern stitches, designing projects worked in the round and other basic design info at the front of the book.  In the back of the book there are illustrations and instructions for knitting techniques, the abbreviations/symbols.  There are 288 pages total, but the book isn't so big that it shouldn't fit into your knitting bag.  While there are some stitch patterns I have seen before, there are enough 'new to me' stitches to make this worth the purchase.  I am very happy with it, and can't wait to start swatching.",5.0
"I have purchased several of these books about various topics and have been pleased with each one.  I like the fact that a lot of pictures are included as well as the explanation, since I am mainly a visual learner.  This book will be used later as a reference book.

I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to increase their confidence in sewing.",5.0
"I've been sewing quite a bit for the past 15 years or so...much of this has been self-taught.  So, this book has been great to fill in the gaps and the ""whys"" for what I've been doing.",5.0
"This is a easy to use guide to sewing. I haven't been sewing long but thought I knew alot, but this book has many pointers.",5.0
"I credit this book with teaching me not only to sew, but in helping me recognize that I am a visual learner. Previous to finding this jewel I had read other sewing books, many highly recommended, and felt only frustration and confusion by the terminology (even in so-called ""beginner"" books.) For instance, I read the description/meaning of ""selvedge"" over and over, but it didn't actually click for me until I had this book. Here a simple glance at a photo told me everything I needed to know to identify WHAT the heck it was so I could get on with the actual sewing. No more wasting hours trying to decipher text on how to position fabric for a particular action, once again clear and large photos clarify the matter. I refer to this book constantly and I find it's well-organized, with a complete index.

If you find yourself stumped or frustrated by other ""beginner"" books, you may find that you comprehend and learn far faster from a tutorial with lots of photographs (step by step demonstrations) than endless paragraphs of text. I know it works for me and I have several wonderful completed projects now to show for it. I even added some ""advanced"" touches to my beginner projects thanks to this helpful guide. Kudos to Ms. Colgrove and the publisher for recognizing that visual learners need different tools.",5.0
"This was a gift for my daughter-in-law, who had never sewed before.  The visual style of teaching was great for her and she loved the book.",5.0
"This works great for me.  I can get more out of seeing what something should look rather than reading instructions.  I'm thrilled to have this book, it's a real time saver and helps me remember things I learned a long time ago.  Highly recommend.",5.0
These books are wonderful it's like having someone standing next to you showing you step by step how to do something. These are great..,5.0
"It is a book that has been proven as great learning tool for my granddaughter with her new experiences in sewing....and it is often used as a reminder of those things I already know, but with the years might not remember at the moment.  I bought this in conjunction with Sewing Visual Quick Tips and would recommend both highly.",5.0
Pictures are clear.  Most subjects you will encounter through intermediate knitting are covered.  Book is well organized.  this books sits on my knitting shelf where I can get at it quickly,5.0
"Excellent starter book, even for Guys! Learn the basics of sewing. Become knowledgable both in machine and hand sewing. Learn about purchasing and selecting fabric. Lots of pictures and illustrations.",5.0
This book was in great condition. It has many great tips and instruccions on sewing. I will be purshasing two more to share with other people.,5.0
"I am very much a novice seamstress. I used to participate in a Civil War

I am very much a novice seamstress. I used to participate in a Civil War Reenactment troupe, resulting in me needing to learn how to create period-correct clothing (or pay the exorbitant fees for clothes from specialty vendors). After buying a sewing machine (see the review for my current machine here), I have primarily learned how to sew through trial and error.

In an attempt to earn extra cash, I decided to make doll clothes to sell at the county fair. After breaking out my sewing machine, acquiring cloth, notions, and various embellishments, I made a doll skirt. At that point I realized just how rusty I was- I don't think I could've made a more crooked seam if I tried. I immediately logged onto Amazon and made use of my Amazon Prime membership: within two days I held my copy of Teach Yourself Visually Sewing.

Allow me to explain the reason behind my purchase. I am very much a visual learner; reading a paragraph of instructions without pictures (or even minimal pictures that may not necessarily cover every step) renders me down to the learning function of a monkey attempting calculus.

After reading other customer's praise for this book, I clicked the button to purchase it.

I cannot begin to explain adequately just how great this book is. I learned more about sewing within a half hour of reading than I learned over the past six years.

Debbie Colgrove's writing style is very informative while remaining simplistic (a sewing pun!). This is not to say that she writes as though the reader is an idiot, rather, she takes the time to explain concepts without cluttering up the book with sewing terminology. Too many other teaching books make the assumption that people know the ""lingo"" for their topic; Ms. Colgrove will only do this after she has defined each word she introduces.

The pictures within the book are also excellent. For each lesson, there are step-by-step photographs which clearly show what you should be doing with your fabric. The accompanying sentences for each picture are concise and well-written, which enabled me to learn new sewing techniques quickly and easily.

In addition to providing step-by-step instructions for various sewing techniques (basting, flat-felled seams, French seams, & etc.), Teach Yourself Visually Sewing also explains what I term your craft-specific ""knowledge base"". What this means is she takes the time to show the reader how to read patterns, how to properly cut cloth, the difference between types of cloth and thread, and much, much more. In short, this is like explaining the why for a what. Not only do I now know which needle to use for heavier fabrics, I also know why you need to use that needle. By teaching the reader the ""why's"" for everything, you will be more likely to retain what you have read.

The book also includes several projects that you can attempt, ranging from a novice skill level to much more advanced. The patterns include things such as a hostess apron, pillows, a receiving blanket, a table runner, and more. Each project is also illustrated to ensure that you are completing each step successfully.

The Final Word

Teach Yourself Visually Sewing is an indispensable tool for any skill level. The information contained within this book will have you sewing straighter seams, cutting cleaner lines, and more, within a matter of hours. I will even go so far as to say that every sewing aficionado should have this book in their arsenal as a reference material (again with the sewing puns!); I feel that there may be no equal.

This book, to my opinion, is better than even the ""Idiot's Guide"" and ""For Dummies"" line of books. With those series, there are not many pictures and simply a lot of text trying to teach you [sometimes] really complicated concepts. Teach Yourself Visually Sewing provides clear, full-color photographs and wonderful written explanations for each.

In short, if you are serious about learning to sew, have sewing as a hobby, or only sew when you need to replace a button, this book is a must-have. Like me, you will find yourself consulting the book frequently to ensure that you are doing everything correctly, or to brush up on a step. This book is simply the best value for your money!",5.0
Very good book with illustrations for a beginner and someone who has a bit of sewing expertise. I give it four stars.,5.0
"Easy to learn sewing with this book.  It has great pictures, you do not need to read, just look at the pictures and you will be sewing in no time.",5.0
I am very happy with this book. It has a lot of details about sewing and it has plenty of illustrations. The book is very helpful for beginner to the art of sewing.,5.0
I'm a beginner and this book explains everything perfectly. The pictures are REALLY helpful. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in sewing.,5.0
"We love love love these little maze books!  My daughter is a maze fanatic, and these are great because she can work on them at home, or take them anywhere with her because they are on the small side.  She is 5 years old, and they are difficult enough to keep her engaged and challenged, but not so difficult that she becomes discouraged.  A great buy.",5.0
Son and grandson and I do these together.  Nice family time.,5.0
My son loves mazes. He loved this book for Easter. They are mazes on his level. He is 6 years old.,5.0
"Great stocking stuffers for my grand children. I find these types of books to expand their thinking, and promote learning. They just think that they are fun books.",5.0
"smaller than I thought, but good mazes and the book is well made. Perfect for car trips or taking in for doctor appointments, etc.",5.0
This books are great for traveling and handy for keeping the children busy. They fit everywhere.  They have been useful too for my mother who has Alzheimer's and this helps her as well.,5.0

"We love these little activity books and love how small they are. Perfect for little hands, pockets, purses and backpacks. Good to have on hand. Great quality.",5.0
granddaughter loves it,5.0
This book is the perfect size to carry in your purse or diaper bag. My son loves the mazes which gives him a break from his coloring books. The answers are in the back if the child is having a little trouble completing the maze.,5.0
Great value for such a little book. I brought this in my travel pack for my toddler on the plane since he loves mazes. It would be great for a restaurant or doctors wait too! These would also make fabulous party supplies.  I will prob purchase another one for our next trip. It's small but thick and full of pages to last a few hours.,5.0
"We bought several of these for a very long road trip. My children are ages 6, 4, and 3. The 4 year old is addicted to mazes and he really enjoyed the varying difficulties and themes of these mazes. All the pages are in black and white, so when he got tired of doing the mazes (which did take a while), he colored everything in. My six year old was through the book fairly quickly, but it was still enjoyable for her. These are the perfect little books to have on hand for car trips, doctor's offices, and church pews. They're small enough not to draw a lot of attention from others and they fit well in the hands of young children. All you need is a pencil or crayon and you've got some pretty entertaining and mind-bending fun for children!

The quality of the book is what you would expect - it's all lightweight paper, stapled together. The illustrations are cute. The mazes simply drawn but challenging for young minds. I'd get more from this line.",5.0
My Granddaughter loves these.,5.0
"Excellent value, and can keep young children entertained for a few minutes.

Now these books are small--but that's kind of the point of these book, I think. They're portable, easy to throw in a briefcase or purse or back of the car, and handy to give to children at the doctor's office waiting room, or in an airport, or on a car trip, or at a restaurant waiting for food, or really, just anywhere where you want to have a short educational (or semi-educational) activity.

And I gotta admit, I like that this is an ""un-plugged"" option. Not on a phone or tablet or screen--just a good old-fashioned book with simple activities, vivid illustrations, and things to *do*--that is, an active, tactile experience--even if the activities are quite simple (like peeling stickers).

We don't leave home without a few of these. (Just be prepared, if you haven't ordered these before, for a small booklet, not a *book* book.)",5.0
great for kids,5.0
granddaughter loves it,5.0
My son is 4.5 and recently has been really interested in doing mazes. I keep slews of these around in case we have a car ride that's semi long or if I want to have something cheap to give his little friends to take home. The price is phenomenal!,5.0
"All of these little activity books are great. My 3 year old takes them along with us on long trips, grocery shopping, Church, etc. The books are small enough to fit in a small purse. My 8 year old also loves them.",5.0
Love these little books! You can't beat it for the price. Our daughter had poor fine motor skills and her handwriting is suffering because of it. I bought these to help build the motor skills so prepare her better for 1st grade.,5.0
Fun and simple. Easy to carry around for a boredom emergency.,5.0
This is the perfect sized activity book to bring with you.  Fits great in a purse without taking up all the room.  My kids enjoy doing the mazes.,5.0

"I bought this stained glass animal coloring book as part of a gift for a 10 year-old girl.  The gift included various coloring books and a colored pencil set.  This book was the first one she went for.  The ""stained glass"" effect works quite well, actually.",5.0
I enjoy the realistic look of the animals in this book. my grandchildren love the pages and we love to tell stories about the animals in this book,5.0
"If, like us, you have hundreds of ""drawings"" around the house these are a nice change. When colored, you can hang them in the window.",5.0
I would recommend this book to anybody that likes wild animals as there are very nicely done pictures to use for many different projects.,5.0
"These are some really beautiful pictures of wild animals I have seen.  It has been a fantastic tool to have, also.  My daughter was doing a report for school on giraffes, and this fit perfectly.  I have been very pleased with this book and intend to buy more stained glass coloring books in the future.",5.0
"This coloring book is a fabulous way for my children and I to do something fun and constructive, ""together""  It also allows us to relax as we use our imaginations, yet trying to keep our coloring and blending of colors as close to the real paintings as possible.  My children are young, 9 and 7, and I truly feel that this coloring book, aswell as other coloring books of its kind, help them ""appreciate"" art in a whole new way.  And what could be more rewarding for them than to be able to display their final product in a window for everyone to see!

"The best foil origami paper I have come across (having shopped for foil paper in China, US and UK). Each sheet is delightfully very square. Also, it is the only foil paper I know of that does not wrinkle at creases, and flattens out again very cleanly, so it is easy to create 3D origami. It is very good value for reasonable price.",5.0
"I find the paper quality excellent, it's like the japanese foil that I use normally. It's easy to fold and the colours are beautiful. The price is good too, it's less expensive than in the online origami paper shop where I generally do my shopping.",5.0
"bought this for my sister she loved the colors and the size of it. but she mostly loved the
fact it was shiny. great product for little kids.",5.0
"I have a 9 yr. old son that is really into Origami, I have a hard time finding him the right kind of paper here were we live.  Amazon has tons of choices on paper and he loves this foil paper the best!  This is also an excellent value.",5.0
"Great paper for folding, foil stays on the paper even after a few creases or folds, it doesnt release from the paper as some do.",5.0
"Origami foil paper

First of all, this is not a book, it's a collection of 18 sheets of foil backed with white paper, for use in folding origami models. The foil is reasonably good quality and does not crack when you make a sharp fold as some do. The range of colours is quite good though as always in a multi pack like this there are some you may not want to use. The sheets are cut very accurately and the papers work well for folding complex models as the foil is very thin.

I regard the cost as being the one thing against this product, there is no need for all the extra packaging and the paper could easily have been sold in its cellophane wrapping only with just a tab at the top or a cardboard insert with the publisher information, and then it could have cost far less. However it's difficult to find good quality origami foil, this is similar in feel to Japan foil so seasoned folders will be pleased to have an easily available supply.",5.0
Excellent book for those to like to knit/ing.  Lot of interesting reading and patterns.  Not for the novice Knitter.  Good book.,5.0
"I've been in awe of knitted counterpanes/bedspreads,so of course I had to buy this book. The photographs and illustrations are worth the price of the book, in my opinion. I really want to try making one of these, and have even bought size one needles to do so. I think I'll start it in January, with the goal of having it finished by December. Why? Just to say I finally made one! Even if you never make one yourself, just having the book and dreaming about it is well worth it.",5.0
I knit a great deal and saw this book in it's first edition and wanted to buy it but it was out of print.  If you knit...get this book,5.0
"When I first saw this book years ago, I loved every counterpane in it. I started making one, and then lost the book. I am so glad to see it in print again. It is full of beautiful designs. One could use parts of these designs for edgings, etc if one didn't wish to make a whole bedspread. (I think most of the counterpanes call for small size knitting needles, like ""0"" or ""00"".  I know my metal ones are bent from making multistitch popcorns, etc.)",5.0
"I saw an afgan pattern on Ravelry that said it was a counterpane.  I had heard the word since childhood from my mother and other elders but didn't know what it meant other than something to do with a bed cover.  I liked what I saw on Ravelry so I went searching for more information.

I found this book and knew I had to have it.  I think I will have to do a lot of practicing to get good at the squares, but they don't seem too difficult.  It looks like it might take a long time to make a counterpane, but would be well worth it.

Interestingly enough on page 2 there was a reference to a collection of Atoinette Lackner Webster from Eat Poultney, VT.  I have Webster relatives from VT.  I don't know if she is related but I wrote to the Poultney VT Historical Society and found out that Tony is deceased and they didn't know where her collection was but they did know a friend of hers and hopefully I will some day hear from the friend.

If you like knitting and want a challenging, fun task, try a counterpane.  The squares are created and assembled the way quilt squares are: a haphazard-looking design becomes a beautiful ""Picture"" when the squares are sewn together.",5.0
"I loved this book and started stitching a picture the day I got it. I live a magical life and this is the best book for someone who wants to put so magic in their projects! There is a wheel of the year,a beautiful dragon, Father Sun, Mother Moon and even some witchy magnets!! You will not be able to stop stitching. Metallic thread and beads embelish almost ever picture and they sparkle. Oh and the charts are full color and very easy to use.",5.0
The cross stitch patterns were easy to read and work.  I've always liked Ms. Elliot's work and this just shows how great her talent is.,5.0
"Great book, especially for people who love fantasy designs. I don't know which design I want to stitch first. They are all lovely.",5.0
"I've been a fan of fantasy stories and themes my entire life, so when my grandmother-in-law said that she'd make one of her cross stitch master pieces for me, in the design of my choosing, I started my fantasy cross stitch search. Until now (as a fantasy buff) I only knew one name in the world of cross stitch, Teresa Wentzler, but I am pleased to say that I've found another one just as talented, Joan Elliott.

When I received Bewitching Cross Stitch in the mail yesterday I was flat out stunned at the quality and complexity of the designs Joan Elliott created. The showcase designs are simply gorgeous, awe-inspiring. Her designs look like painted stitchery, not cubist interpretations. They are sometimes whimsical, other times hauntingly beautiful, always lovely. Even better is the fact that, while I'm not a big stitcher myself, she includes petite pieces and coordinating projects out of each design that are small and simple enough for the beginner to attempt (and actually finish).

Standout projects include the Father Sun, Mother Moon, the dragon from the cover, and the black cat/magical workshop. The cover of this book does NOT do it justice, the dragon pictured there is covered in tiny details and fine stitching.

Lastly, as a Pagan, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Wheel of the Year pillow and the celestial faces. The only thing missing is a Green Man face, now THAT would be gorgeous given the same treatment as the others.

All in all, a great book for those who like fantasy and magical designs. I think it's worth every penny, on sale or not, and will definitely recommend it to my likeminded stitching friends.",5.0
I love this book!  All the projects are fabulous!! I only wish that it didn't have color charts - and page overlapping charts would have been even better as well.,5.0

"Very nice patterns. Love that the designer has broken out some of them as smaller projects, too.",5.0
Magical and fun designs,5.0
"An excellent find, I am so very pleased with this book. I usually get a book for one pattern in it that I see, and reluctantly do the rest of the patterns to get my money's worth. You will not have that problem with this book.

Full colour patterns with gorgeous pictures, as well as tips on how to use patterns to the fullest extent, not just making the picture, but how to pull pieces from a pattern and make it look good. Your only problem you might have is finding all the reasons you want to do the patterns! Christmas gifts galore!

There is a lot of beading in some of these, but those are easily left out of the pattern if you aren't a good beader or a beginner. I would say this book ranges from intermediate to advanced, some of the smaller patterns are really detailed in the way of backstitching, though I wouldn't see a problem in giving it to a beginner, as there are parts of larger patterns they could do. All in all, and excellent book.

Here is a video if folks want to see some of my completed projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8nJevDS5Gs&feature=youtu.be",5.0
Love it there are so many projects I want to do. I'm not sure where to start. Great price also.,5.0
Pictures are clear and big so you can see the squares clearer! The only thing bad I could say is that the pictures are so big they off on 2 pages so its a little hard to follow on some. But the pictures are great!,5.0
There are so many ways to describe this book that it is hard to choose just a couple of words.  The colors and the designs are fabulous.  The patterns Father Sun and Mother Moon are by far my favorites and I can't wait to begin stitching them.  They are just absolutely beautiful.  I bet Joan had a wonderful time coming up with these.  The colors are over the top.  Everything about this book is way over the top and anyone would be hard pressed to find a book to beat this one.  These designs are just small reasons why Joan Elliott is by far my favorite designer.  The designs are definitely bewitching.,5.0
Beautifully done and well laid out patterns.  Will be some nice projects to work on this winter.  Thank you for sharing.,5.0
"I bought this book for 1 specific pattern. After I got it and went through it dozens of times, there are SEVERAL projects in here I am VERY excited about! This book has the most beautiful patterns! Colorful, big with great detail and small easier patterns, the 1st I've seen that uses beading, metallic threads and multi tone threads....very Magickal and pretty :) !!! I LOVE this book!!!",5.0
My friend is doing the cover dragon and I am doing Lady Moon. What a beautiful book with great detail on cross stitching these designs. Imaginative and non-offensive or scary.,5.0
"Not only are the designs beautiful, but the comments and presentations throughout the book just make you feel good. Everyone can use a little more of that these days. I would recommend it.",5.0
Love Joan Elliott patterns aways good instructions and graphs . Good lists for supply's as alway I enjoy she patterns and pictures.,5.0
"This book is enough to happily convert unknowing stitchers to become Joan Elliott fans. It makes me want to collect all her design books. The book is just full of wonderful designs, making it difficult to quit looking and dreaming os what to stitch first. It's worth much more than the price I paid!",5.0
"I bought this in the hopes that it would have a dragon that wasn't evil-and I wasn't disappointed. My son loves dragons but the only pieces you seem able to find are the fire breathers waiting to kill someone or be killed. This has a beautifully done dragon, as well as other magical designs. I love the small snowy owl and the Witch's Best Friend. There are detailed pictures and there are simple day or two projects.",5.0
"I was thrilled when I got my copy of this book. The book is well made and the charts are easy to read. What I did not expect was how many lovely designs were in the book. Usually when I get a book it is for one design, but all of these are fun and magical. When previewing the book before ordering only a handful of designs are shown, so seeing Phoenix and all the witchy designs and the ornaments (little designs that go with the bigger designs) was a pleasant surprise. I've never stitched a Joan Elliott before, but now I have to hunt down some of her other patterns.",5.0
"*UPDATE*
I LOVE THIS BOOK! I have done almost EVERYTHING in here as gifts or just 'cause. I m redoing the Cresent Moon Dragon again. The 1st time I did it on black and it looks FANTASTIC! Now I'm stitching it on a blue/grey tye dye fabric.
This book ISN'T for beginners... itworks with evenweave fabric you have to work over 4 strands and its not only hard but it took me almost 8 months t finish the dragon because of that fact. The other ones are on regular Aida (you COULD do the dragon one on Aida but I'm a stickler for detail!) The charts are PERFECT... in full color and easy to read, 1/2 of the patterns take up more then 2 pages and each and every page is color. Some projects are small like post card size but the biggest one is the wizard (I am eagerly awaiting fabric or that one!), 18x22 inches!  I TOTALLY think its worth the money, I have had this book for a little over 2 years and i go to it whenever I need a project (my sister loved the Hope (bird) cross stitch and my cousin loved the egyptian style bookmark)...
If you can afford the amount of money and time it takes (you need PLENTY of both) then this book is a must have!!

I found this book at the library and when i rented it i knew i had to buy it. the designs are a little big (1-4 pages) but the images when done are more then astounding. i am an avid cross stitching addict and have to work on three projects at the same time but with these they don't bore me or make me want to go to another design.",5.0
"I love all things mythical and have fallen in love with this book. All of the patterns are extremely beautiful and so fun to stitch. I have already completed the ""Mother Moon"" and I am currently working on ""Father Sun"" and I have to say that they are both magnificent! The colors are rich, the details are beautiful, especially the metallic thread and the beading. If you are into stitching and love to do mythical type projects, this will be your favorite book. I first borrowed it from the library and after looking through it, I had to buy it for myself.",5.0
"Joan Elliott has outdone herself with this book. Beautiful designs. Breathtaking colors. She was born to design for cross stitching.
Every chart in this book is incredible. A friend just finished the Crecent Moon Dragon, and I am working on the Chinese Phoenix, my favorite in this collection.
If you want a challenging, yet extremely enjoyable project, this book is for you!",5.0
"Great patterns, and smaller sub-patterns for those who need a quick stitch or wish to make a full set!",5.0
"I bought one for myself and one for a friend when I saw mine.  Joan Elliott is the artist that draws the most beautiful faces in cross stitch. I like ""Mother Moon"" so much, I immediately bought all the ethereal Kreinik metallic floss,beads, and fabric to start stitching! The colors that are used to make her patterns are really seen once you get all the ""ingredients"" together. Once you start you know you are creating a Goddess! Next will be ""Father Sun"" and the wonderful Wizard and Dragon that are also in this book. I have bought other books and have been disappointed once you get them home and see how poorly done they are, but not this one. Some of these patterns were originally published in English Cross Stitching magazines. If you go to her web site you will have to pay more for just one of these pattens then you will for this whole book.",5.0
I was happy to receive this book.  It was all I expected and more.  The coloured charts are bright and clear and easy to see. I bought the book originally jsut for one design but have happily found others I look forward to doing.,5.0
"There are so many amazing designs in this project book that I am having a hard time deciding which to stitch first.  The book is color coded, which is easy for the stitchers in my family, especially my husband, who is working his first project from this collection.  While it is highly ambitious to do a first project from one of the large pieces in this book, it is especially valuable for stitchers who have done several projects and are looking for designs that go beyond teddy bears and old fashioned samplers.  If you are a fan of fantasy art, this book is strongly recommended!",5.0
I have already started the Father Sun pattern. Of course I made some floss changes. The Krenik floss that they call for is hard to use and more expensive than the Treasure Braid that I have chosen to use.,5.0
"What a fantastic selection of designs! As both an avid needleworker and a Pagan, I really appreciate the patterns in this book. They range from beautiful, large projects like the Phoenix and Mother Moon, to smaller projects for when you want to make gifts or just don't have the time to commit to a long-term piece (I plan to use the phoenix feather design to make pillow cases). My only small feminist gripe is that there's a huge, involved Wizard piece, but no Sorceress/Witch aside from a cutesy kitchen witch. I'd love to see an enchanting enchantress who isn't dolled up in a Hallwe'en costume over a cauldron. Still, for the scope of the works, well worth the money. I'm going to try adapting the Wheel of the Seasons to needlework, it'd make an amazing design for a tapestry.",5.0
"I saw this book in a library and new I had to buy it - very exciting to see an entire well-crafted book of counted cross stitch designs that aren't just flowers, kittens, or Biblical verses. As an intermediate-advanced cross-stitcher, I love the detailed, non-cartoonish designs. The colors are gorgeous (though naturally, with a little imagination, you could swap them for others if they aren't to your taste), and (extra kudos to the publisher!) the symbols on the charts are colored to approximately match the thread colors, making them fantastically easy to read. Each large design is also accompanied by a few smaller accent designs/charts, along with instructions on various project ideas (tea towels, keepsake boxes, etc.). The book also provides clear lists of items needed for each project and estimated sizes of finished designs. As a note, I recommend making a photocopy of the chart you choose to work on; a copy is easier to handle while you're stitching, and keeps the book from getting too worn.

I hope to see more from Joan Elliott and this particular publisher. I also recommend Teresa Wentzler's fantasy cross stitch collection, though her designs are far more detailed and challenging, and the charts aren't quite as easy to read.",5.0
"Beautiful papers with solid color complementary backs.  I like the larger size, too.",5.0
"I love these papers by Tuttle. I have almost all of them now. Beautiful colors with print on one side and coordinating solid on the other. The paper weight and size is perfect for all sorts of different paper applications. I use them for origami, paper beads and Modge Podge.",5.0

"This book from Japan is a wonderful book if you want to get started in needle felting. It has detailed instructions to go along with the many colored pictures showing the item you would like to create. The author also has little notes about her fuzzy friends and why she has created them making this a personal experience as well as fun and easy. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get started in needle felting. Not only is it about cute fuzzy animals but she also includes some everyday items such as pillows, pouches, and a rabbit shaped plate just to name a few.",5.0
"I've loved Donna Kato's work for some time, but while I've purchased several polymer clay ""how-to"" books in the three years I've been working with PC, this is the first of Ms. Kato's books I've purchased. It won't be the last.

I received it today, and read through it, cover to cover.  My hands are itching to try the techniques she so generously and painstakingly shares. While other leading polymer clay artists sell these same techniques individually in seminars and on expensive DVDs, Ms. Kato has demonstrated several processes I've been hungry to learn in one place, in a beautiful, inexpensive and clearly written book.

Hats off to Donna Kato!",5.0
"Absolutely fantastic  book. If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",5.0
Exciting and inspirational!  Great information.,5.0
very good,5.0
"I just received Donna Kato's Creative Surface effects.  This book appeals to me immensely as I love the heavy Asian art and Art Nouveau influences  The coloring of her projects feel both soft and strong, and I love her patterns.  I like this book as her designs are substantially fine art creations.  The designs are rich yet bold with patterns that are unique.  Techniques are well demonstrated through both pictures and clear instructions.  This is not quite for the novice as it assumes that you know the basic polymer clay techniques.  However, I think it would be a great addition to anyone's library because the point is to challenge ourselves.  So many beautiful things and never enough hours in a day.",5.0

Of course this is a great book - every polymer artist should have Kato's books. I'm not a fan of her clay (WAY too hard to condition) but her instructions in her books are impeccable. She is the true Queen of Polymer!!!,5.0
"This book out weighed my expectation's! This book is so wonderful and so informative. Donna gives you do's and don'ts and everything in between. So many wonderful thing's were swirling around my head while reading. This is an updated version of an older book she wrote and It was so interesting that I bought the old book too.

"I love this book! I fell in love w/i this book 3 years ago in a well-known bookstore, where it was priced out of my reach, then. When I finally had a little more money, I thought to go to Amazon for the book, and got it so inexpensively that a friend asked to get a second copy for her.

I have purchased Donna's other book on polymer which is excellent and this book is also in e same top quality directions are very clear with sharp images of steps for completion of projects.

"This book is awesome! I'm a long-time polymer clay lover, and though I know the basics such as conditioning, curing, safety, tools, and a few helpful tricks, I never really knew how to achieve all the amazing effects true clay artists use. Now I do.
This book covers a variety of effects, such as the three-dimensional illusion, several different image transfer methods, faux-enamel, and more. And to make it even more perfect, it isn't a project book, and it's not a technical book: it's both. It focuses on teaching you the techniques, but at the end of each chapter, there's a single project that shows you how you can use what you just learned. It's the perfect combination!",5.0
"Donna Kato is at it again. She has many books out on many subjects. She has incorporated so many different techniques in this one book. She is a talented artist and it becomes evident in this, her latest book. She sparks my creative juices. Great Book.",5.0
"but this one is my personal favourite.
I have a lot of polymer clay books. Unfortunately very often books repeat themselves and one cannot find many new and interesting informations. This book is full of wonderful inspiration and techniques brought into perfection. If you are interested in polymer clay and want to learn and understand it - Donna Kato is the best book-teacher. After going through this book you will see more of possibilities hidden in polymer clay",5.0
"This is the first book I have bought of Donna Kato's. It is absolutely fantastic - I cannot find fault with it. Well written, beautifully illustrated and full of inspiring project ideas. Donna's skill shows through in the quality of her work. I am a perfectionist and truly admire her standard of craftsmanship. I will definitely be buying Donna's other books.",5.0
"The best source I've found for spectacular surface treatments in polymer clay.  The explanations are simple, equipment minimal, and results very sophisticated.",5.0
"Highly recommend this book for its clear instructions, as well as inspirational photos. Since I cannot attend a Donna Kato class in person, I am always eager to add another Donna Kato book to my collection. I also purchased Kato's Millefiori Techniques at the same time. Both books are terrific, as well as Amazon's price and delivery time.",5.0
I recently bought this book and I have to say I am loving it!  There is so much to see and do.  I cant wait to start.  The instructions are direct and concise.  And the projects leave me craving the next page.,5.0
"I'm a professional researcher at heart so when I delve into a topic I dive into the deep end and don't come up until I've exhausted the field. True to form this is what I've done with polymer clay. My thinking: If I'm going to spend a lot of money on tools and supplies I'm going to research the heck out of the topic so that I technically understand what's what.  As with most artistic mediums, success and high quality results are dependent upon the artist/crafter's understanding of the technical issues.  This is where Donna Kato comes into my life (so to speak).

I purchased Kato's first book 'The Art of Polymer Clay' and was blown away by the depth and breadth (underline that last) of subtopics presented. Her writing and step by step explanations are clearly presented without being too pedantic. The side by side pictures detail the techniques being discussed and don't omit that critical step which makes the difference between success and failure. Some authors don't edit their own work very well and when omissions of this sort happen it drives me crazy.

From my experience with her first book I purchased Kato's `The Art of Polymer Clay: Creative Surface Effects' and again wasn't disappointed (remember my expectations at this point were high). This book is an outstanding tool. With Kato's help, and admittedly the help of other well qualified author's  my overall appreciation of polymer clay techniques has grown leaps and bounds and I look forward to years of expressing myself in the millions of ways this particular medium allows.",5.0
"Wow, that's some long title.  The book is excellent in that is shows step by step how to transfer images to clay, stamping, using stencils, inks and paint to make the most unique pieces of art...............not the clay projects you remember from childhood.",5.0
"Donna did it again with this book and as with her other books, I am learning so much.  I suggest this book to anyone who wants to take their polymer clay work to another level.  Well written, great photos, easy to follow instructions.  Thanks for another great book, Donna.

"I was totally new to clay working, heading for a class in the medium, when I purchased this book.  I was absolutely delighted, and was able to start my class with some background and understanding of working the materials.  I sit in awe of Ms. Kato's talent, and did find the techniques more difficult than they look.  This aside, it is an excellent accumulation of many of the techniques that makes polyclay such a joy to work with.  Ms. Kato does list several varieties of clay, inks, paints and other products, but I appreciate that she enumated which she found easier to work with, and why.  I did expect some bias towards Kato Polyclay, as she helped develop it, but have also found this an excellent product to work with and have not been disappointed with its performance.
The book is a MUST HAVE for the beginner reference library, and is also an inspiration with the images from Ms Kato and other artist's collections.  I'm pleased I purchased this book, and plan to keep it as a cornerstone for clay working.",5.0
"I was surprised at how many ""finishes"" you can give Poly Clay. This book explains it all . She does show alot of ""specialty tools"" you can use - but they can be substituted with your own tools or simple copies. GREAT BOOK - Great Pictures and easy step by step instructions.",5.0
As with all of Donna Kato's books it is well written and her explanations and photos are geared for all level of artist. It is a must have book if you love working with polymer clay or just love to look at innovative Asian influenced design ideas.,5.0
"This is an amazing book and one that you should really get to add to your collection of polymer clay books.  There are soooooo many things in here to try. I just can't wait!
Plus, buying it from here saved me lots of $$ over the local craft store cost and even ebay.",5.0
"Donna Kato's new book, with photographs by her husband Vernon Ezell and a foreword by Carol Duvall, covers a wide range of techniques and styles.  Kato's work defies categorization, covering nostalgic pieces, modern pieces, whimsical items, Asian-inspired items, and even sculpture.  Her versatility is amazing.  Her teaching ability is wonderful, and through the many photographs we get to see her flawless craftmanship in action.  I was especially intrigued by her Brocade Technique and by a watercolor-y bead, done with alcohol-based inks and a rubber stamp of some handwriting.

Always breaking new ground, Kato gives us a collection of stylish, artistic and creative techniques.  She carefully explains each one, along with reasons why she chose the materials she used.  She includes work from other artists as well, making this a well-rounded and extremely useful book.  It doesn't get any better than this!",5.0
I recommend this book highly. It's for the most advanced as well the mostly beginner polymer clay artist.  Definitley a keeper. I routinely order lots of books on polymer clay and donate most to the library...,5.0
"I reviewed this book at a bookstore before I bought it.  Wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down, I had to read through it from front to back and again in certain areas that interested me more....",5.0
"To be honest I was a  little disapointed by Donna Kato's first polymer clay book, but this one makes up for that, and then some!
It is about 50/50 techniques and projects and covers everything in great detail.  The projects are really interesting and different for anything I've seen before.  The finished items look really professional and prove that polymer clay can be pretty amazing when in the right hands. I would strongly recommend that anyone into polymer clay get this book.",5.0
"If your looking to do something different with your polymer clay, then this is the book for you.  I love all the different methods Donna Kato talks aout, and she writes so well, it is so easy to read, and she makes you feel like it is the easist thing in the world.  I love just looking at the images in this book as well.  The only thing I would say I don't like about this is book, is that several of the projects are japanease style, but this doesn't make any difference bcuase you can create whatever designs you want to.  If you thinking about a polymer clay book-to extend your knowledge then don't hestiate to buy this one!",5.0
"You get to know how to, to all the things the title of this page says but most of the projects are to make pendants, if you looking to make a lot of beads projects get "" Making Polymer Clay Beads: Step-by-Step Techniques for Creating Beautiful Ornamental Beads by Carol Blackburn "" as complement to this book, I think you gonna learn a lot out of this two books to start making polymer clay jewelry or whatever.",5.0
"I just started working with polymer clay a few weeks ago and wanted a book that logically explains techniques as well as offering good photography.  Being a librarian and fiber artist, I HAVE to have my own library of art/craft books for reference and inspiration. Kato's is one of the best I have for any media.  It's well written and organized and the photos are inspiring.  I highly recommend this book for any polymer clay artist or library wanting to add a high quality book to a crafts collection.",5.0
This book is so well done with instructions that are easily followed. It opens the creative channels and encourages you to explore and take things to the next step. Donna Kato is so sharing and giving and an inspiring artist. This is a valuable addition to your library.,5.0
"I am admittedly still a beginner, only claying for the last year. I learned so much about little things I had not known from finishing techniques to folding clay that the time saving alone was worth it! Coupled with the amazing techniques found without I should have enough knowledge to create some beautiful items, amazing book!",5.0
"This is a must for anyone who is into Polymer Clay...! Tons of new techniques and tips to make all your projects outstanding..!
Donna's done it again..!!",5.0
"Donna Kato has done it again!  Her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay, published in 1997, is still a valuable source of information but now
she has written another that is also a beautiful, informative, visual gem.  This one is full of surface effects including methods of transfers for toner and inkjet prints, stamps, stencils, inks and paints, liquid clays and more.  Each technique has a step by step tutorial with clear photographs and text. The finished pieces are all enhanced by outstanding design as well as craftsmanship.
A great book by a truly talented artist.  It has been well worth the wait.

"With this long-awaited book, Donna Kato has deservedly earned the title of the ""queen of polymer clay"".  This is a wonderfully well-written, and beautifully photographed reference for both beginners and established polymer afficionados. Donna's mastery of this medium is unrivaled and so is her generosity when it comes to sharing her knowledge. There is inspiration on every page of this book and countless techniques that will lead you on an amazing creative journey that starts the moment you open it.  Enjoy the ride!

"Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]

Yes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.

It has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.

Donna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.

Donna splits the book into seven different sections:

  * Polymer Clay Basics
  * Mica Shift Techniques
  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay
  * Creating Texture
  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders
  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays
  * Sculpture and Mold Making

I love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.

The twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.

Peppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my ""Donnelly's Sampler"" is included in the book.

This is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.",5.0
"This book is more like a ""Polymer Clay Bible"".  I've been working with Polymer Clay for 2-3 years and have several books.  This one is by far the best I've read.  There are so many techniques that were new to me and her explanations are so thorough.  The step-by-step pictures are beautiful and all of my questions were answered.  The tools, cutters, paints, clays, etc. she uses are all identified and easily obtainable. The pictures of her amazing art and those of many other artists are beautiful and so inspiring.  This is definitely a book that every PC enthusiast will want in their library. It's one you will refer to over and over again for both inspiration and pleasure.",5.0
this book is outstanding for both beginner and advanced polymer clay artists.  there are many wonderful techniques to learn and utilize in your own projects.,5.0
"Donna Kato is a perfectionist and a wonderful teacher.  She is generous with her expertise and ""secrets"" of this craft form.  This book is so well put together that experienced clay artists will find much to inspire them and refine their art, while beginners will learn quickly and develop their craft.  Donna's style is elegant and adventurous, rarely ""cute"", and the final products, as she makes them, are worthy of high end jewelry stores and craft galleries. But she makes the techniques so accessible that I think even novices will produce something to be proud of.  In addition to a beginning section on all the basics of working with clay, the actual projects include details for finishing and refining them so that they don't have that ""homemade"" look.  Even if you're just a dabbler in this field (like me), you will appreciate the beauty of the book and the level of instruction.  It inspires you to think that, if you really took the time, you could make something this wonderful, too!",5.0
"This long awaited book sure lives up to (and even exceeds!) what we'd expect from Donna Kato!  The book is meticulously and concisely written and photographed, and the projects are simply _gorgeous_!  Each unique and classy technique is more intriguing than the last....every turn of the page brings added excitement about trying out her projects.  Donna's writing style and the formulation of the book are reader/clayer friendly, and the instructions so clear and easy to follow.  I'm fairly picky about polymer clay books, and this one definitely ranks at the very top of my collection.  In this book, Donna shares with readers her unbelievably unique, creative and stunningly beautiful techniques and shares her vast knowledge.  Even this avowed 'caner' is excited about trying the many surface techniques from this book (steering me away from caning isn't easy to do!). I highly recommend that clayers from beginner to advanced add this latest of Donna's books to their libraries.  I don't think I can praise it highly enough! It's a beautiful book...a 'classic'.",5.0
"I've worked with polymer clay for over fifteen years.  I have almost every book every published on the subject.  This new offering by Donna Kato is concise, clear, beautifully researched and breathtakingly photographed.
We've waited a while for this book to appear and it has been worth the wait.  So many books on this subject offer great photography but confusing text.  This newest book offers the processes we've wanted to learn in terms that we can all manage - no matter our abilities!",5.0
I have been working with polymer clay for five years and have purchased many books but this is the best one ever.  It is a must for both beginners and experienced polymer clay enthusiasts.,5.0
"I bought this book when I knew next to nothing about quilting.(I could piece, and that was it!) I have learned so much from it, everything from how to choose fabrics that look well together to binding and finishing. The  book has a complete list of tools you will need, and step by step  instructions on piecing several differnt quilt blocks. It is complete from  start to finish.  I have a lot more confidence and I have actually finished  a quilt.  I refer to this book so often it is getting a bit dog eared. My  only regret is that my copy is not a hardcover.",5.0
"A friend of mine loaned me her copy of this book, and I am buying my own  because if I don't, she will never get hers back!  This book takes you step  by step, gradually but not insultingly so.  I like the way they include  both hand piecing and working on a sewing machine.  Also in this book are  interesting historical tidbits about quiltmaking.  I started out thinking I  would just read this to learn enough to teach my daughter to sew a little,  but this book is so inspiring and easy to follow, I am doing the projects  and learning to love it!  Whether you are just starting or have lots of  quiltmaking experience, this book is very helpful, interesting, and a great  resource.",5.0
"This was among my first books as a new quilter.  It's been excellent.  First, I like the hard-cover format, because it has spiral binding & I can leave it open to review as I work.  Simple, detailed instructions &  tips for each step of the quilting process, both machine & hand-work.  Includes easy-to-read charts for measuring fabric, speed-cutting &  piecing.  Gives detailed instructions for more advanced techniques.  Plenty  of projects, from simple blocks, wall-hangings & quilts.  I'll continue  to refer to this book for years!",5.0
"I have found this book to be absolutely invaluable!  It was the first book I purchased when I began quilting, and though I have accumulated many books over the years, it is still the one I refer to most often.  It covers  patchwork and applique, piecing and quilting, choosing fabrics and design  basics, and a multitude of other invaluable information.",5.0
I didn't know anything about quilting till I bought this book it has taught everything I need to know. Very good book for a begginer and even an experienced quilter. The projects are easy to understand.,5.0
"If I could only recommend one book on quiltmaking this would be it! It covers all aspects from beginning to end and is appropriate for the novice as well as the beginner. I have referred to it over and over again. The illustrations and photographs are clear, concise and simple. All the fear and mystery of quilting has been replaced with fun. As a quilt teacher I can recommend this book with confidence. My only ""complaint"" is that I need another as I am wearing out my current one! What a wonderful gift for someone special.",5.0

It teaches techniques by making sample blocks, has useful tips highlighted, is so friendly, simply, easily put that even I believe I can follow along and make a quilt without reading an encyclopedia's worth of information.  This book has all the information, but it is so well put that it doesn't overwhelm you.  THIS IS THE BOOK FOR BEGINNERS AND EXPERTS ALIKE.  BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT. This is the book I will use to start my 20 yr old daughter's quilt, and have a reasonable expectation of finishing it quickly and beautifully.",5.0

"This is a good reference to keep on hand, and I like the way they introduce you to quilting and the different blocks. Instead of having you make several large quilts, they teach one or two techniques with a single block, then teach something else with the next block.  At the end, they combine the blocks into a sampler quilt and show different layouts for the same set of blocks. It will take practice to master the techniques, but you have some variety while you are learning and are introduced to new things before you get bored or frustrated.",5.0

There are a few areas (i.e., more pics or more detailed terminology) that you might need along the way.  I did want a little more info about machine quilting.  So, I just purchased one more book ""The Quilters VIsual Guide..."" to use as a second reference.  I paid $7 for a used book...including shipping.  It was ""brand new"" when I got it.

"This book is absolutely wonderful. Concepts are presented in a lesson format, teaching you to cut pieces, piece by hand and machine, draft templates, speed piece, paper piece, various styles of quilting (hand, machine, trapunto, and more), and much much more. If you work through the first few lessons, you'll have enough information and experience to tackle a fairly complex quilt. Working further into the book you'll learn techniques you never thought you'd care about... until you make your first quilt!

In fact, by the time you finish all the practice blocks, you'll have enough blocks for your own sampler quilt!

This book is definitely the first book you should buy if you're learning to quilt, like I am. I've already finished piecing my first quilt top, hae it basted to the batting and backing, and today I'll start quilting by hand. This is something I never thought would happen.

If you can only get ONE book on quilting, THIS IS THE ONE!!",5.0
"Quilter's complete guide is the first quilt book I ever got and it is just the best. It show you everything a new quilter need to know and has a step by step way of learning how to quilt, if you can not get to a class.

"I recently got interested in quilting and purchased this book. To my amazement it has all the basic information that you need to complete a quilt from beginning to end.

"I took this book out of the library a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to get my own copy.  Marianne Fons & Liz Porter have written a book that is even clear to me!  That's an accomplishment! Each quilt in the book starts with the invitation to make one block, in order to learn new techniques. When you've completed all these single blocks you can put them together and have quite an impressive quilt.  Instead of having one quilt pattern that you're comfortable with making, you have an entire repertoire!

These women are excellent teachers.  They include tips throughout the book. Many diagrams, many clear pictures illustrating the steps.  I can't say enough about this book. Whether you're a beginner or an accomplished quilter this book will be an excellent addition to your bookshelf.",5.0

It has lots of great information at the beginning about what supplies, types of fabric, choosing colors, and sewing tips.  Then the rest of the book is filled with patterns/designs and how to put a quilt together for each step.  If you only buy one book - this is it.  I found that you can get a lot of free patterns online so as long as you have a great reference book like this, any other books are just 'fluff'.",5.0

"One. of two, of my all time favorite books for quilt making, hands down. Liz and Marianne have created a book that will teach everyone some important skills. It sits inches away from my machine at all times. If I have a question I run to this book for the answers. The layout is fantastic. It starts out with a Quilt making Primer, which offers you everything you need to know about Tools, fabrics, and colors. You learn basic quilting skills and then move into direction for block drafting. Then it is onto borders, where you will find an important chart on how to calculate for borders. The book takes you through the step-by-step process of thinking, creating, making and finishing a quilt. Every step along the way there are two page classes on skills you can learn, to put into action the tricks they just taught. Then you move beyond basic patchwork to more intricate techniques. The patterns range from easy to more complicated and remove the risk element on new techniques while you learn different block construction skills.",5.0
These designs are new spins on traditional patterns.  Usually Fons and Porter use more than one color scheme so that the same design takes on different moods.  I subscribe to the authors magazine.  Each issue has some quilt that I must have.  Enjoy!,5.0
this is another great book from the gooseberry cookbook line.  i get these for the wife and she immediatly reads through them.  she writes down which recipe and/or craft she wants to do.  she just loves gooseberry,5.0
"The book was exactly as promised.  I have the series, but was missing this one.  Thanks for completing my collection.",5.0
"Another cookbook from the set that is full of delicious recipes for Christmas and beyond.  These cookbooks are published annually and because the recipes are so down-home, even the early ones contain recipes that are still good for today.  The GP cookbooks never go out-of-date.  I love them.",5.0
"I have all the Christmas books now and many, many of the other cookbooks!  I have so many that the bookshelf is full!  But I will be passing some of these along to my daughter soon...too many to keep here!  She is a wonderful cook and a new mother so will find most of the recipes easy to prepare...Then someday, she will have them all if she wants them. I love the Gooseberry Patch cookbooks and illustrations in them,  The hints, ideas, and recipes are wonderful.  Have not tried one yet that has not been good!",5.0
i love anything gooseberry patch.  takes me back to when i was growing up.  plus i like to see what other people are making.,5.0
What's not to love about Gooseberry Patch.  The crafts are great and easy.  The recipes are also good.  Have the whole series.,5.0
"Service was excellent, and packaging was perfect. I'll continue to order from Amazon, and really apreciate the GR8 service, and products. My wife really enjoyed the Gooseberry Patch Christmas book number 13.",5.0
"This is book number 13 in a series by Gooseberry Patch folk with fantastic things to make and cook!!  Everything is fairly easy to make, and for a non-cooker, people rave about what cook out of these books!! I love all of these books, and look forward to book number 14!!",5.0
"I always appreciate how Gooseberry Patch offers beautiful and creative ideas that are also actually doable. Gooseberry Patch Christmas Book 13 is not just a recipe book, but it also offers craft and decor suggestions that are perfect for the holidays. Of course, there are stunning photos that show the completed dishes and projects, as well as lovely Christmas scenes indoors and out. There are fourteen sections with all kinds of festive holiday ideas, from open houses to woodland decor to casseroles and delicious blue ribbon cakes.

It also has lots of family favorites from their readers like Corn Casserole and Early Riser Breakfast Casserole or the holiday colored Cranberry Broccoli Salad. I was glad to see the chapter with treats that only use five to seven ingredients, like the Easiest Pumpkin Cupcakes with just five ingredients in it, plus the cream cheese frosting!

All of the crafts would make excellent gifts and have full instructions and templates in back, from the sewing kits and aprons to a coiled rag basket. I can't wait to start making the Snow Day Pillow that I saw in the Handmade Gift Area, with its adorable appliqued snowman and children making snow angels. And the Framed Button Tree is a perfect way to turn leftover buttons into a lovely decoration. I think it's really nice to have fun things for the kids to do while I'm cooking and getting ready for guests and they have a section for Fun and Games for the kids, with lots of good ideas, including an darling Turtle Tic Tac Toe Toss.

Gooseberry Patch really knows how to do Christmas and Gooseberry Patch Christmas Book 13 is no exception, with so many wonderful ideas to help me and my family have a warm and memorable holiday.",5.0

I'm going to get a bunch of these for Valentine's Day to give out! The packets are great to give to anyone at your church, homeless outreaches, orphanages, nursing homes etc.  In each packet/goody bag I put a Bible tract (I like the ""Somebody Loves You"" Bible tracts), candy and a bracelet that I make and maybe cookies or brownies that I make.  Go bless others today and buy these to share the gospel in a fun way!  Make some Jesus packet/Valentine goody bags for anyone and everyone you know!  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."" Mt. 24:14.  Amen, come Lord Jesus come!

"I love this puppy book, it's really nicely illustrated and has plenty of room to add photos and information about special moments in your puppy's life. I just got my new puppy, and I can't wait to start adding to it. I love that it is a hardcover book, so it is durable and looks very nice.",5.0
"This book is a hardcover book, a little pricier than some of my 4 human kids baby books, but it has pointers about safety issues, purchasing items for a dog, etc.  There are pages to fill out about the parents of the dog and about the humans in the family that's adopting the puppy, a page for paw prints, place for filling out litter information, feeding information, personality of the litter, adoption dates and info, human playmates like kids, training info if you get a trainer, or a training class, doctor info, immunizations, weight and height, and many pages for photos of both Jewish and Christian holidays as well as neutral non-religious holidays.  It's 72 pages long, and has animal organization info like websites and address and phone numbers.  This is a great book to get before you even get the dog because you will be prompted to ask for more information than you got from the owners.  I can still call, but I don't want to be a pain asking for more.  I already had them email me photos of the parents, and they also sent me photos of the puppies at birth and one week and more.  There is plenty of room for all of this.  Book is 11"" by 9"".",5.0
"When my son suggested that i make a ""baby book"" for our puppy like the ones i had made for my children, i thought he was crazy. So i started looking for a book that in actuality, i didn't think existed. in my search, i came accross THE PUPPY BABY BOOK so i ordered it - when it arrived i was so excited, its a very user friendly book (even child friendly - my 8 year old fills out the info) and is styled exactly like a human baby book and all the information pertains only to dogs. this book is wonderful! If I adopted another dog i would definately purchase this book again. And I do think this book is a must if you truely love your pet like a baby to document all pertinent information.",5.0
"I am a new puppy owner, and like most, I am ABSOLUTE gelatin in her paws.  When I caught myself getting inordinately excited that my ""baby"" went up the three steps to the deck by herself at only seven weeks, I decided (to my infinite embarrassment) that I needed a puppy journal.  After searching diligently for about a week, and rejecting all of the silly, cartoonish and cheaply-made wire-bound variety journals, I stumbled across this utter gem.  The first thing that makes ""The Puppy Baby Book"" stand apart is the fact that it is an actual hard bound book.  This really IS something that will withstand the test of time.  The artwork is clean and understated so as not to take away from your photos or entries.  It is done in subtle hues with a definite art deco sensibility.  There are also several handy pockets inside for things like adoption papers, medical records and even your puppy's first rabies tag.  I couldn't be happier with the exceptional style and quality of this book.  I would particularly recommend it for pet owners with a sense of history and an appreciation of those classic breeds that were at the height of their popularity in the 20's and 30's (Boston Terriers, Greyhounds, Afghans, etc).  Finally, Three cheers for this and all those other struggling independent publishers out there.",5.0
This unique book is a must for that puppy lover in all of us. This chronicle of your puppy's life will become a treasured keepsake to cherish for years to come.,5.0

"I absolutely love this way of quilting.  It is so easy to figure out the different blocks and you can get so many various looks by just changing the way you cut the block.  Jodi has done a great thing here with her way of quilting.  If you are new to quilting I would recommend this book but also  her video.  It helps to watch her do the actual squares but once you have  the hang of it, it is no problem.  She is also very good of answering any  questions you might have by either phone or e-mail.",5.0

"If you are a serious rider looking for the best rides and roads, Butler is the map for you, I picked up one and looked at it while my bike was being serviced a couple weeks ago and was impressed by how much great stuff they packed into a manageable, tear-resistant, fold-up package. I'm a big GPS guy but there are times when you just want the ""big picture"" for orientation or for trip planning. I can sort out the best roads for my trip and then put them together in my GPS for a great single or multi-day ride.

I'm heading out on a ride in a couple of days and couldn't find the Butler map I needed anywhere I checked in my area. I contacted Butler customer service to see if they could point me to a source I may have missed. Butler came through for me in completely unexpected ways. Their customer service went above and beyond the call to ensure my trip came off without a navigational hitch. Outstanding product and exemplary customer service!",5.0

"This book is a treasure with something for every quilter to love, from the beginner to the experienced quilter.  The Farm Girl Sampler Quilt is shown on the front of the book.  There are  45 Farm Girl blocks + Barn and Tractor blocks.  Each block has it's own page with very clear directions for both 6""  block size and 12"" block size.  I especially liked the option for the 2 sizes of blocks.  Any one single block could be made into a whole quilt  --  there are numerous examples of Mix & Match Setting Quilts.  There are also ideas given for table runners, pot holders and wall hangings. The author has her own multiple fabric lines which would be very helpful for fabric selection.  I just discovered  Lori Holt's designs and I became an instant fan.  I like how she takes everyday items and turns them into darling blocks + giving such good directions for the reader to join in the fun.  This book is a great showcase for her style.",5.0

This book is different! All of the blocks are really cute and the instructions clear. I`ll be using this book many times for sure.
The fact that all of the block instructions are given in two sizes makes it even more useful.
The spiral binding makes it easy to use as well because the page opened will stay open and you can come back to the instructions any time during the cutting and sewing process.
VERY recommandable!",5.0
What a fun book!  Of course I'm going to make all the patterns in this book!!!  I do leave it out so when there is a few spare moments I have it right there to pull out my scraps of fabric and get to work.  Lori Holt writes fun and easy to do books....love her.,5.0

"This is a great book to add to your collection.  The quilt pattern(s) are charming with easy to follow directions.  I especially like pieced shapes (as opposed to appliqued shapes), and this book has instructions for many.  It is designed for retro fabric (is it called that or depression era . . . can't remember.), so if you are not attracted to that kind of fabric, it will be more challenging to select alternatives.

"I have only returned two books in my life, and this was one of them.

I purchased this book because the cover looked promising.  When I received it, I realized that these two little dogs were the only projects like that in the entire book.  As another reviewer also mentioned, the vast majority of the projects in this book are also for wet felters, not needle felters.

The real reason I returned it, though, was the truly horrible writing and directions.  I realize that this was written by a non-native English speaker, but could the publishing company not have tried to clean it up a bit before releasing it to the unsuspecting public?  I am already a fairly experienced needle felter, so I could have figured out how to do the (very few) needle felting projects on my own.  However, a true beginner would have been totally lost and would probably give up on the hobby as a result of this hideous book.

There are a lot of good needle felting resources out there.  I encourage the new felter to check out some other books and websites rather than buying this trash.",1.0
"I found the book just did not live up to my expectations. When will crafting books realize that photo transfers done with xerox machines hardly ever work as they are shown in books? The techniques of photo transfer, which is covered in this book as if it works, is really frustrating. Also, the use of translucent clays to good effect is iffy and the high polish acheived by the author on many of the pieces. I just couldn't get it to work.",1.0
"Have any of the 5 star reviewers actually used the instructions to cut fabric for a quilt? The directions for cutting setting triangles for an on-point set are WRONG. If you follow these instructions, as I did, you will get triangles that are too small! I had to replace several yards of very expensive fabric thanks to the bad directions.
The entire book is suspect now - I threw this POS in the trash. I am very disappointed that such well-respected quilters would give us a book with incorrect cutting directions.",1.0
"I was so excited to get this book; I have been a fan for a while and love the magazine. A complete resource, all in one place. I couldn't get it home fast enough.

The first thing I used it for was to cut the setting and corner triangles for a group of blocks that I was setting on point. I cut according to the instructions and sat down to sew. Waaaiiitt... they were ALL THE WRONG SIZE. Did I cut them wrong? I checked the instructions, nope, the instructions given in this book by well-known and admired authors to cut setting and corner triangles was WRONG.
Naturally I had used all but a few inches of that special color, long out of print, not available anywhere, that tied it all together. I adapted my plan and  finished the quilt, but not before tossing this book in the trash. I would not donate or sell this error-ridden piece of junk to someone else.",1.0

"Sorry, but I ordered 6 of these and two were substituted with red ones.  The four I received were great. Very disappointed since I needed and wanted six pink ones.",1.0
"I was excited to find this tool on sale at Amazon and was eager for it to arrive. Hugely disappointed! The caps won't stay on, especially on the stilleto side. This makes it a VERY DANGEROUS TOOL to have in your sewing kit. If you have children in your household, do not purchase this item. I am floored by the number of people who reported the problems with the caps, and still gave it a 5 star rating.

The other problem I have is that the glue used to keep the product stuck to the cardboard backing during shipping left a sticky residue. Removal leaves a stain. This product is made in China and I wonder just how much Alex was actually involved with it. I suspect it's her name that is used here, not her talents.",1.0
Broke in two week.,1.0
"The ""caps"" don't stay on well, and the ""presser"" isn't smooth.  I have also heard that they varnish came off on a fellow quilters piece when she was using the ""presser"" part.

It's a great idea... but it isn't made well.",1.0
"I ordered this ""tool"" because of it being suggested by the designers of a paper-piecing pattern I just bought.  Being a ""prime"" member, it was not sent in the time frame of that membership.  Then when I did receive it...the metal tip of the seam ripper was broken off and inside the wooden cap.  When I found that, the shaft of the whole seam ripper piece came right out as if not glued and/or secured in the handle.  I am returning this for a refund, I don't even want to mess with a replacement.  I also informed CT Publishing of the dissatisfaction with this product.  I would suggest not to purchase this as a ""real"" quilter's tool.  Not good quality.",1.0
"The quality of the 4-in-1 tool is poor. The wood is not finely finished, the caps refuse to stay on, the point and cutting surface of the seam ripper is not notably different than any other seam ripper on the market. Considering the price, you would do better to purchase a stiletto and seam ripper separately.",1.0
"about this tool!

I really was excited to find this tool. I was sure of the quality if Alex Anderson is involved and she won`t give her name for a bad buy. That was a mistake......

Well, the idea is really good, but the quality of the tool is horrible!
The lightly adhering caps drop away every time. So I can't put it in my sewing bag, because the risk of injury is high.

The wood has lots of indentions and the whole tool has a bad completition! Wasted money!",1.0
I was so happy to see this tool.  I thought it would be great but mine is already broken.  I put the wrong cap on the seam ripper and it broke off.  Both caps were very loose and kept falling off.,1.0
"There is no use in ordering an e-book with templates from Amazon/kindle, since you can't print from the e-book. And the hassle to get the templates from another site is a drag. Definitely not worth it.",1.0
I never order it so I can't review it. I don't know why is in my list of orders to review it.,1.0
This is not wrapping paper. Too thick and awkward to even consider wrapping anything in. It's a poster of a map. Waste of money. Description very  deceiving.,1.0
I thought this would be wrapping paper.  It was really just two maps.,1.0
Thick and hard to truly wrap a gift with. It looks nice but it's not true wrapping paper as I was expecting,1.0
"I ordered several sets/tins to decorate a suitcase and none of the stickers from these sets are sticking or staying on the surface. The other stickers I ordered, a book of old fashioned luggage stickers from a different brand stick well.",1.0
"The nicest thing about this item is the attractive tin the stickers come in. The stickers are also quite attractive, but they are also very small and don't stick very well. Also, there are many duplicates. I had hoped for the original quite large stickers that were common in the era of ocean liners. I wanted to decorate a steamer trunk I own.",1.0
I was excited to get theses stickers for my suitcase and for my guitar case. I wanted these to represent all the places I travelled to. I put many of them on and the next day almost all of them were on the floor. They failed to stick. Very disappointing product!!,1.0
"I didn't look into this purchase enough and if I was smart I would have returned it. I HATED IT! It is out of date and most of the bags looks like something that only a butch lesbian would carry arround. Nothing pretty or fashionable.
Think twice before going for this one. They did a great job at marketing, however the product stinks.",1.0
"If I'd had the chance to flip through this in the bookstore, I never would have bought it.  There are no diagrams or illustrations, the directions are confusing, and the bags are generally hideous.  (I would say that they were out of style, but virtually none of them could be said to have been stylish in any era.)  If you're tempted to buy it based on the other reviews, do yourself a favor and check it out at a library or bookstore first.  The (very) few tips it has to offer are better found elsewhere.",1.0
"50 designs from many people and most are UGLY.  That is quite an accomplishment.  The one on the cover is OK so you hope for the best if ordering site unseen.  The advice to check it out in library first makes sense-you'll never buy it if you do.

I also don't want to make a single bag in the whole book and  the instructions on the few I read through leave alot to be disired.",1.0
"I am not a picky person,I like lots of bags in all sizes and colors but this book is just terrible! The bags are not pretty at all! I can't even comment on the directions because there wasn't a singe purse in this book that interested me enough to even read the directions. This is one of those books that will sit on my shelf until I do a clean out and then it will be gone.",1.0
This book is not that great. It is the same purse pattern (fold over flap sack type bag) just has differant designs. Many are for people that crochet... I dont!! And it doesnt' even show how to crochet. What a waste of money... I sent it back!! I did read all the reviews and orederd it any way. Take heed... don't buy it!!,1.0
"Did not care for these designs.  They seemed to be lots of work and not good for practical wearing.  The designs are creative and look good on models, but I knew I would not wear any of them, so did not take on the work, and searching for the errata pages.",1.0
"A beautiful, but very frustrating book due to an abundance of errors. Buy it only if you have tons of time and money to burn from these errors. By the way, if I, an average knitter can easily discover these errors, how come the professional knitters and editors can't fix them prior to putting out their defective product? Not for a beginning knitter unless you want to turn them into an ex-knitter.",1.0
"I have been a fan of Norah Gaughan for many years.  I always looked forward to her designs in knitting periodicals. I have knit a few of her designs. The pictures are nice in this book and the concepts are interesting.  The designs leave me cold.  I also bought this book unseen, but with Norah's previous designs in mind.  I would send it back but it would cost me almost as much as I paid for the book in postage.  Let Dr. John C. Scotland knit and wear these designs. Almost if not all knitted designs are comprised with elememnts of math.  Many designers are inspired by nature and I am inspired by the designers.  Two very respected designers come immediately to mind, Meg Swansen and Alice Starmore. This book is the greatest disappointment in my huge knitting book library.  I have never written a review before this book inspired me to do so.  EBG",1.0
An expensive book with one or two pattern worth doing.  I agree 100% with Nancy. The title has nothing to do with the patterns.,1.0
"I bought this book, which I expected to be a beautiful revelation by a great knitter who was going to capture the wonder of natural forms in knitting (Norah Gaughan IS a great knitter - despite my opinion of this one book).  What I found was a very beautifully produced book that is filled with what I'll call ""nature knock-offs"": ""Let's see, star fish have 5 arms, that forms a pentagon, let's all knit pentagons and call that 'knitting nature'.""  Or, ""Honeycombs and other things are formed in hexagons - let's all knit hexagons!""  You get it.

Aside from the disappointment of discovering that a book is not really about what the title implies (photographing knitting outdoors does not make the knitting ""natural""), there is also the fact that the book designers desided that all the models should look depressed.  I know this is a current fashion trend, but in the context of a book that isn't doing what the title says it will do, and in the context of what are often designs that boringly repeat a chosen geometric form (I like geometry, but really . . . ), well looking at depressed, wan models did nothing to uplift the situation.

There are actually books out there that do what the title to this one promises but fails to deliver.  Anyone interested in really discovering how to look at nature and then create knitting that captures the living heart of natural forms should look at The Art of Knitting (why didn't Norah read this first?), Poetry in Stitches and Inspired Cable Knits.  Those books really have something to teach all of us.",1.0
Has anyone actually used these written instructions?  The stitch count is off on almost every lace row.  You have to work out the correct count before you can begin each row.  Something is terribly wrong here.,1.0
"I was disappointed in the book.  I purchased the book based on the quilt on the cover.  I am an experienced quilter but found nothing ""easy"" about the piecing techniques described. For me, using black netting to provide shadowing in not an acceptable method to use on a quilt either as a bed quilt (which this quilt is too small to be) or as a wallhanging.",1.0
"I don't understand how this item can be an ""updated 3rd edition"" and still have errors in the CMYK codes for the secondary colors of red and blue. Because of these errors the CMYK codes for the colors associated with them are also incorrect.

Red: True CMYK = 0, 100, 100, 0; Product CMYK =  0, 100, 50, 0

Blue: True CMYK = 100, 100, 0, 0; Product CMYK = 100, 50, 0, 0

A couple simple internet searches will confirm the correct CMYK codes for Red and Blue.",1.0
I purchased this item based on the reviews but as a graphic artist who depends on tools like this to provide accurate color information this is all wrong. I thought my settings in Photoshop were wrong and I went through everything only to find that this tool and its codes are inaccurate. Dont recommend this at all.,1.0
"I bought this product from Amazon, based on the strong user reviews. I was quite surprised to see what it proposes as ""Orange"" (Card #21). Please see my attached photo, which shows :
- this product's Card #21 (""Orange""), on top of
- the ""Pocket Color Tool"" showing a correct Orange reference hue, on top of
- a book with an orange color, on top of
- a book with a white cover.

The color mixing formula given on this product's Card #21 specifies the ""PURE"" Orange hue as CMYK (0,100,100,0). In other words, according to this product, orange pigment is an equal mix of pure magenta and pure yellow pigments. YouTube happens to have a video showing what happens when you mix these two primaries : you get Red! Please search on YouTube for the video called ""YELLOW + MAGENTA = RED""

If you Google the phrase ""orange color"", the results page has a sidebar showing example swatches and images. None of these match what the 3-in-1 Color Tool presents as Orange. Neither do any of the examples shown in the Wikipedia entry ""Orange (colour)"". According to the Wiki page, Orange is CMYK (0,50,100,0) -- i.e. 50% Magenta pigment plus 100% Yellow pigment. So this product's Card #21 is off in both the hue and the CMYK values for Orange.

All of the above is simply technical justification in support of the obvious: the 3-in-1 Color Tool presents Red as Orange. Another reviewer here has mentioned the same perception. For my part, I can't justify or recommend giving this product any further consideration. I will be returning it. Hopefully the publisher will reality-check everything and correct for version 4. (I am reviewing version 3) I have written to the company asking them about all this. If and when I hear back from them, I will update this review.",1.0

"Turns out, the meaning of TRI-colour listed in the description means triangular in shape, and NOT 3 colors per pencil, as the definition of tri-color connotates!!! So, if you are looking for a pencil with 3 colors and not one single color per pencil, then do not get these!!! I wonder if they sell tri-color ink cartridges that are triangular!!!
Because the wording of the item description is not correct and quite misleading, I am returning these pencils, as I have so many single colored pencils already...",1.0

"I LOVE moleskine products and have so many notebooks, I can't count. I even gave out mini moleksine notebooks at my wedding. This one disappoints, though. There is one small section for recording meals and the rest of the book is for vitamins, etc. - everything in a separate section. I'm not sure who designed this, but it doesn't have enough pages for actually tracking food in a food journal and as a user, I wouldn't flip back and forth between all of the sections to record info. I should have just purchased a Moleskine calendar.",1.0
"If you are looking for a 29-Day Food & Exercise Journal here ya go...

From the makers of the legendary Moleskin notebooks comes this glaring missed opportunity. There are far better Health Goal Journals out there. This one is a terrible disappointment.

Includes a 14Day section called ""Games/Sports."" 14Days? WTH? A 50(!!) entry section for ""Body Treatments."" So you can log all of your wraps and facials? All 50 of 'em that your'e gonna get within the 29Day Food & Exercise period. And, a 60 entry section to log all the vitamins and medications you are taking... Ummm Huh?

"I actually returned this.  Might do for the occasional movie-goer, but not for the serious, 52 films a year person like me.  Paper way too thin, hardly any room to write a critique, not lined, and who wants to put down a memorable line from each and every movie they see?  Or the title in the original language?  Came with all sorts of stickers, as if this were a grade school assignment.  Not for me.",1.0
"Although I love moleskine products, this product is something I do not find useful at all. This isn't a practical recipe journal.. There are a limited number of pages and a bunch of blank pages...",1.0
"The idea is wonderful but it has a lot of problems with it.  For one, the pages are way too thin, making it impossible to use pens without the ink bleeding through.  I've been using a pencil and colored pencils, but it's definitely a problem.  Second, the stickers they include aren't worth the price of this journal.  I was expecting better stickers.  The organization of this product makes sense in some sections, but is difficult to maneuver in other sections.  Other reviews have basically said it all.

All in all, I absolutely would not recommend this product.  Save your money.",1.0
"I've been happily using Moleskine notebooks and this is the first time I'm using a Passions Journal. I like the minimalist concept and the quality of paper. However, the alphabetized tabs of six review pages each seems more of a LIABILITY than an asset to me. Why? So far, I have already watched and reviewed five movies and my journal still feels and looks empty because they're scattered everywhere following the stringent alphabetization of the titles of the movies that you watch.

In other words, it doesn't make me feel like I had accomplished writing a lot of reviews as I would've if only I could write down my entries chronologically and see what I had written page after page. The alphabetization is a weak feature for me especially because in the back pages they already have blank index of the movies so why the alphabetized tabs especially when you can only review a limited number of six films under each letter?

To fill this journal with your valuable insights about the movies you watch, you got to watch movies with titles that you can equally distribute across twenty-six letters multiplied by rooms for six films. But the question is, what happens once you run out of room under certain tabs?

With an already efficient pagination and a blank index in the back, what's actually the great benefit of the limited alphabetized tabs?",1.0

Go Heat Transfer Paper for short.",1.0

What a piece of garbage. The Avery dark transfers go on beautifully and stay on beautifully too. I'll take that over something that won't even let go of its paper any day - the rest of these (after three attempts - I should have quit while I was ahead!) go in the trash, where they belong.",1.0

The ones that do fit work well. There were less than 5% that were obviously broken or cracked. I strongly recommend considering another brand. Not sure who's making these for PC, but they simply need better QC to ensure that this high a percentage of defective units aren't going to the customer.",1.0
"I bought two of these glue guns, and on both of them the trigger failed within aprox. 8 hours of use.  Once the trigger fails, the glue gun will not heat up.  They are junk and you would be wasting your money if you  bought one.",1.0
"You would think buying one of the more expensive glue guns would get you your money's worth. Not always the case.

I've been using a glue gun since the sixth gradeso I know how to use a glue gun. It's one of the most amazing tools a creative person can have and use. Since that original gun was lost over the years I thought it would be good to buy a ""professional grade"" glue gun. Yes, this looks big and nice and well made, but if only it worked the same. The yellow glue that is supposed to go with this drips out of the nozzle like it's leaking; it's almost impossible to control the output. Then in under a month's time I was pushing glue into it and somehow the glue stick is now stuck. I can't push the glue stick in, or pull the glue stick out. It's now unusable and trashed.

If you're doing crafts, I'd recommend a *mini* glue gun. But if you need a dual-melt gun for delicate gluing get something else. For now I'll stick with cheaper mini glue guns that just work.",1.0
"I bought this gun mainly for it's interchangeable nozzles. However, when it arrived, it turned out that the default nozzle was almost impossible to remove, due to a faulty thread in the gun itself, In removing the nozzle, the thread was stripped, so that none of the nozzles now can screw on!!
Gun itself may be OK, - I don't know, since it became useless only a few minutes after I received it!
Wouldn't buy another unless the thread was checked and found to be OK.",1.0
"I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this -- like some others, the gun never dispersed a drop of glue. I heated until smoking and smelling. No glue.

I first had issues with the tips staying screwed in place.  They would continually rotate while I was trying to work causing for my work to come out with less quality than desired. The second issue I had with the tip was that one broke off while inside the heating element.

I went to use the tool and it didn't alter the solder I had, so turned it off without using it at all. I bought solder which flows at a lower temperature however the next time I went to use the Versa Tip it wouldn't even turn on.

My reasoning for purchasing this despite negative reviews was I trusted the Dremel brand.",1.0
I agree with another customer review that this is not worth a crap. I too used mine twice for small projects and the tool broke off in the iron and no way to get it out.

"I purchased this specifically for the hot knife. After only 10 mins I noticed the base of the tip starting to bend at the threads. I was not misusing the knife or putting undue force on it. It snapped after less than 20 mins of use. The tip broke with part of the threads inside the tool, rendering it useless for anything else. The knife attachment could have been designed better and made out of better material that will stand up to heat. I was expecting more from the Dremel brand. Don't waste your time or money.",1.0

I have a couple of older woodburning tools that I use occasionally, but they were never high enough in wattage to get hot enough and would take forever to complete a project. So, I bought this one which worked great for two months. Now it doesn't heat at all. I would probably try a replacement of the same one with the idea that maybe this was just a lemon. But, if it happens again, I would never buy this product again.",1.0

"I bought this engraving dremel even though I have a general use one and it came a day later than it promised, thanks ""get it tomorrow..."" not. Also when i attached the tip to it it did not feel secure.

"installing the engraver point was impossible; not only did it require tools i didn't know were needed, but once acquired, the screw lining was so bad that the entire product is unusable now. i'd be happy to try again if sent a replacement; otherwise i would NOT recommend unless the appropriate tools are provided or the product documentation is updated to include this info.",1.0

"What was I thinking! There was a reason I hadn't bought a Dremel in years...they're cheaply made, so they fail often!
$16 for an engraver?  I should have known better.  The most important part of the tool, the system Dremel used to hold the cutting bit in place, failed. The little screw was never able to hold the bit, finally it stripped. So it failed without being able to perform a single operation. But really, I'm not surprised.  You'd think they would ""get it"" after all these year! Cheap price doesn't cut it if it doesn't work, and when the bit cannot be held properly, the tool does not work!

"Pretty bad, especially coming from Dremel, which usually makes high quality tools. This engraver, however, is rather weak and hard to use. Worse, the tip constantly flies out and must be put back in again, and again, and again. You really need a tiny eyeglass screwdriver to be able to put the bit back in.

"Who knows if it works, didn't come with a screwdriver so you can use the tip. The screw and screw hole are much smaller than anything I have. So be careful unless you have that.",1.0
"i did not recieve the number template or carbide point with this, even though the packaging and description clearly state that is included. i cannot use.",1.0
Template does not fit the tip. So nothing can be done. Horrible and inadequate instructions.,1.0
Faulty plug. Cant connect tu electric socket.,1.0
"It would be nice if it came with a screwdriver that would fit the screw you need to loosen, tighten. This thing is completely useless without one. Now I have to make a special trip to the store. Sucks!!!",1.0
"It came without the actual spare part that goes on the tip, can't use it",1.0
"Didn't even work, and since there are no safeguards for online shoppers, all I can do is this.",1.0
"My bit wasn't included.  I tried to open up the area to put the bit, thinking it was hiding there, but no bit :(",1.0
This is not as easy to use as described. I have not been successful engraving since my purchase.,1.0
No,1.0
There were no letters included. Had to purchase separately.,1.0
This product is very loud. I could not use it at home because it annoyed everyone. I will have to purchase another one that does not make much noise.,1.0
"Read the negative reviews before you purchase. I got this tool tonight with additional engraving tips. I was excited to try out the other ones and after 2 changes, the screw that is supposed to hold in the tip, won't hold anything in any more. Not to mention the pain of trying to find a small enough screwdriver to get the screw out to begin with. I have a note into Dremel since all the packaging says to contact them instead of the seller... so we'll see what they do about it. But I'd advise a shopper to keep searching to avoid the headache or disappointment factor.",1.0
Do yourself a favor and get a better dremel,1.0
I haven't been able to use it. It vibrates too much and it's too noisy.,1.0
Does not work!!!!  should of known for the money. calling amazon ..,1.0
"Tried and tried to unscrew it, so could put a blade into it.  Never could, so gave up.  And then just got a small
hand held one that works even better.  Also looked cheaply made.",1.0
"My first engraver blew & the first time I tried to use the replacement, within 30 seconds it started smoking  would probably have blown again if I hadn't stopped using it. Maybe I expected it to be able to do more than it can",1.0
"Poorly designed and manufactured. I had a red Wen engraver for years and will be looking for another tomorrow when I return this. The Achilles heal of this tool is the the design where the bit is supposed to sit in a round shaft at the top of the tool and be held in place by a set screw. First of all, Dremel has purposely not pre-installed the bit, so unneccessary, vexing assembly is required. Rather than use a set screw that takes a hex wrench and provide you with the tool, as is often the case, Dremel has chosen to use a slotted set screw that requires a tiny screwdriver, such as from a jewelers screwdriver set which you will need to own or purchase. A hex wrench would allow you to get much greater traction and it's easy to see that the set screw head will wear quickly. Repeated attempts to tighten the set screw enough that the bit would not fall out failed, so I carefully took the tiny set screw all the way out. to inspect the bit holder When placing the bit in, only the tiniest sliver of its surface area extends into the place where the set screw can make contact. There's just no way this thing will work the way it's supposed to. Save your time, money and sanity and get another engraver. (If not, better keep your receipt.) This is one of the worst tools I have ever dealt with. I have loved Dremel's mini tools in the past, but this one will cause me to think twice (and read reviews) before buying Dremel again.",1.0
SOMETHING GOING ON WITH DREMEL I THINK.  My first Dremel engraver was fine.  Had to get another and that one died within a week.  Looking for another good engraver.,1.0
"Very unsatisfied with this product. Bought this Dremel engraver about one year ago. Worked fine for six months then started shorting-out. Limped it along for several more months until the short become so bad that it quit working entirely. I thought it was just a fluke that it had a short. So I bought another one. Used it once for about three minutes and it worked fine. Just went to use it again and it's not working. Makes a soft buzzing noise, but will not engrave. Very frustrating! Sending this one back and will never buy a Dremel engarver again!",1.0
"Utterly terrible. As a beginner engraver I was really excited to use this product for glass engraving - for which it is highly recommended. Strangely though I had a total of ten minutes in which to use it. I first put it on for five minutes and it caused the glass I was working with to become unbearably hot. I now know that that is NOT NORMAL with electric engravers. I tried it a second time two days later. It sparked, flashed and SMOKED within five minutes of being used once again. The entire handheld region registered at 50 degrees Celsius (according to my turkey cooking temperature gauge). Thankfully I bought another gun for half the price at my local hardware store and it works a gem.
As to the Dremel, it's utterly terrible and I will never buy one again.",1.0
"Bought 11/20/2014. Used the tool only twice, once for a light engraving project, a second time to sand (catching tiny links on a medical bracelet). Today, I wanted to do a little more sanding on my bracelet as some links still catch clothing a little, but the tool no longer works. I submitted the registration today and sent an email to Dremel. I am awaiting to hear what they propose but  their customer service doesn't work week-ends (which doesn't work well for my hobby schedule...). I might change this review depending on how the manufacturer resolves the issue, how fast, and if I end up with a product that actually works or with a refund.",1.0
I do not recommend this product it sucks,1.0
"The bit is only held in place by a tiny screw that was lost while inserting the point. The tool is useless without the screw, will not buy this brand again.",1.0
I'm sorry to say I don't like it and it didn't hold the drill bit in place.,1.0
"I bought this at my local hardware store so I can't comment on the customer service, just the tool. There is a small screw that you remove, insert the tip, and tighten the screw that acts as a clamp to hold the tip in place. After removing the screw completely, the tip would not go all the way into the chamber. It stopped just above where the screw goes. I could see into the hole where the screw goes that the tip would not go any further. I ended up returning the tool. I think this was a fluke because I can't find anything similar in the reviews here, but it meant that I couldn't even use the tool. Bummer.",1.0
"I have tried for over 2 hours to get the bit installed.  I followed the directions, and this should be a very simple task.  I am wondering if I got a dud whose hole is not big enough for the bit since it barely goes in.  I have tightened, loosened, removed, tightened again the set screw with no luck.  Bits will not stay in.  Can anybody help me with this issue??  Please!!",1.0
You have to have an absolute steady hand to use this. Its almost impossible to write with clearly. You can see it but it may not turn out the way you intend,1.0
I AM A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER AND THE UNIT SUPPLIED WAS 110 VOLT AND NEEDED A TRANSFORMER. I PLUGGED IT IN WITHOUT CHECKING AND IT BURNT OUT INSTANTLY. I EMAILED THE SUPPLIER AND GOT NO SATISFACTION. I BOUGHT TWO OTHERS FROM ANOTHER WEB SITE AND THEY WORK PERFECTLY. I WONT BE USING AMAZON AGAIN TO PURCHASE ELECTRICAL GOODS.,1.0
"Upon opening package, found one engraving bit, but there was no tool to tighten this bit to chuck. One is forced to buy optional accessory kit, Dealer uses Nickel & Dime spending sales tactics.",1.0
"Cannot take higher voltage inputs, only 120V other wise you will burn the motor like me. Make sure to get one that supports the right Voltage",1.0
"Purchased this dremel to sign artisan jewelry pieces.  The screw that you are suppose loosen, insert engraving tip and then tighten is so tiny.  I spent hours trying to find my tools used for watches to find a screw driver head small enough, and once I found a correct tool, it still would not tighten.  Unusable, and am returning.  It also stated that a replacement tip was included....not in my purchase.",1.0
"Like other reviewers, I opened the package, installed the engraving tip, turned the set screw and promptly stripped the threads.  What a piece!  All Dremel had to do was upgrade one part of the housing material to a harder grade of metal, and this wouldn't happen.  I guess this helps explain the low price.  I like Dremel products, but this is a swing and a miss.  Look elsewhere.",1.0
"I bought this in May but hadn't had the opportunity to use it until now.  After about 1 hour of use and changing the bit only once, the threads for the set screw stripped and now this is unusable.  I just logged in to return this useless, poor quality tool, only to find out there was only a 4 week return window - unbelievable.  Very unhappy customer.",1.0
now i have to buy a tip because mine never came with one when advertised a tip to be included,1.0
Engraved one number on 6 keys with a diamond stylus.  Tool completely quit working after that.  It is now in the trashcan.,1.0

"Ordered this for my husband for Christmas. He opened it, and the piece on the tip that holds the actual carving tip parts is shoved in backwards meaning the thumbscrew cannot hold the tips in place. Very disappointed, especially since the only way I could get this product was to order it since we are stationed overseas. It will be such a pain to return this....",1.0
"I bought a Dremel 290-1 at Home Depot. I turned it on and the motor sounded like a 747 landed on my roof. With its carbide steel engraving point I tried it on wood and bone, but it barely made a scratch. So I order a diamond point bit from Amazon and tried again but without success. After I screwed up a few of my valuable a few days later... I gave up and start shopping for a new tool!",1.0
"There isn't really much to the story I have for this product, because I didn't even get a chance to fully use it.

Took it out of the packaging and followed the instructions. There's a small screw you're supposed to tighten in the head of the engraver that keeps the tip in place. Well, A) the screw was too big and B) the screwdriver required wouldn't tighten it anymore. Tried out the tool and not even three seconds after starting an engraving the tip fell out. Tried it three more times, and each time it kept happening.

I love Dremels, but I hate this product. Worthless.",1.0
"My girlfriend purchased this engraver for me right before we moved 2 months ago.  I've been very excited to engrave glasses and finally found time to use it tonight.  HOW THE HECK ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIND A FLAT HEAD SMALL ENOUGH TO ADJUST THE SCREW?  I have TWO tool boxes, tried tweezers, a ulti key even, other household items, NOTHING.  A tool should have been included to adjust the screw or the design should have been different.  This experince was ridiculous and very disappointing.  Would return the engraver if I could.  the engraver was purchased under emilycannon86",1.0

"My daughter bought this engraver two months ago and kept it to send it to me as a gift now. When I opened the package the engraver point (9924 carbide point) was missing. I could read from other reviews that this is not the first time!
I can't return the item (they have a ""special"" return policy for this product).
I can't find a way of contacting the seller in the Amazon site.
The only thing I can do, if I am to use this engraver, is to buy the engraver point which should have been sent to me.
Very frustrating.",1.0
Wouldn't know whether it works or not because the package had no engraver tip. I'm not in the mood for 100 bucks worth of time and hassle with Amazon customer service to retrieve a 5 dollar item which I paid for and didn't receive in a sealed package. Somewhere there should be a bricks-and-mortar store which has the engraver point which I can still get before Christmas.,1.0
"It arrived 99.9 % assembled except for the major part- The engraving bit. To assemble it you need to loosen one of the smallest screws I have ever seen, Insert the bit and then tighten. No tool to loosen this small screw was supplied. So sadly instead of being able to use it from the package I need to head to the depot to find the world's smallest screw driver. I don't have one that small in the tool box. Rated 1 for this inconvenience.",1.0

Awl arrived with the handle broken away from the shaft.  Not repairable.  Poor quality,1.0
Not for book binding.  Point big and dull.,1.0
This little item fell apart before I even used it.  The metal collar piece ( attached at the wood neck) fell off as I removed it from the package.  Guess I shall drive the 32 miles to the nearest Harbor Freight and get one tomorrow.  I do not recommend this product.,1.0
Been using this model for years.  Evidently they moved their manufacturing to india.  This tool snapped after 2 days.  Still using the one I bought several years ago.,1.0
I bought this to do book binding but it's HUGE for that so I haven't actually used it because I don't want a hole this bit. It does seem to be good quality and it's SUPER sharp (it poked right through the protector that comes on it) so depending on what you're needing it for it may work perfectly. If you want it for bookbinding this is not the one for you!,1.0
I was very upset with this sadly. The handle has a deep crack running along its length. There is chipping on the metal point making it looking like it  was jammed into something and then put back into its packaging. The Rubber tip protector was just lying besides the point not even covering it before I had even opened it. I do not recommend this product at all. Ill add a photo later on showing the damage.,1.0
"This was a terrible purchase. First of all, the picture shows a very narrow point that gradually slopes, which is perfect for bookmaking (what I bought it for). I got a straight shaft that only slopes to a point in the last 1/4 inch and is just way too big for anything I'd need it for. Not like the picture at all.

If all of this sounds too particular, I should also mention that it came with a rubber tip protector, and the entire point under said protector was absolutely rusted out. It was too cheap to bother returning.",1.0
"This awl is a piece of s***. Don't buy it and don't be lured by the add-on deal. First of all, if you're using it to poke holes in metal (like hammering the top area lightly) the pointy end flattens immediately. The shiny metal you see is just a cheap coating and started chipping off immediately as well. Then, the metal cusp thing that's connected to the wooden head is cheap, after gripping the awl for a couple minutes the cheap glue connecting it to the wood came apart and the metal cusp fell off. Don't buy this piece of s*** awl, please. I'm trying to return mine.",1.0

"I did not like this awl, it really is not for book making you can use it to make holes in a belt but not for making books.",1.0
This awl is not tapered finely for piercing paper but has a short and stubby point at the end that has already ruined two books from a limited edition printing...which SUCKS! Save your money for a better tool- a friendly tip from one disappointed bookbinder :(,1.0
These shears arrived with no packaging and used! They looked super old and had nicks all over the handles and sticky stuff on the blades. Very disappointing and annoyed that it happened. I'd be very careful when you order. Sometimes you think you are buying something new (especially at full price) and you get something totally different.,1.0
"these are awful. just go with the oil based. they're sticky and not smooth at all. makes oil painting SO much harder than it has to be. sure, they're non-toxic but they aren't worth the hassle or the extra cost. no thanks",1.0
"Beware! Color might be off. My alizarin crimson came look weird so I purchased another single tube and here is the comparison. The bad one has an orange hue while the correct crimson is more pink. The difference is very subtle but it will have a more noticeable effect when you try to mix color. I am new to watercolor so I don't really know what cause the paint to be off. But it is really bothering me because crimson is a primary color and I use it all the time....
Also the description says it comes with a #5 brush but it actually came with #3 brush....
Otherwise the case is pretty convenient for me to bring to class and such.",1.0

"1) Goes on like sludge
 2) Does not cover well
 3) Took 5 days to dry
 4) The manual is misleading
  a) company told me NOT to mix the paints with water
  b) company told me water is only to clean brushes
  c) while the manual says you CAN mix it with regular oils, the company says the water in the paint will cause the layer to lift over time
  d) while the manual says you can apply regular oil paint over dry water mixable oils, the company told me that you can't or AGAIN, the layer will lift over time.
5) Even without water the colors do NOT mix well together on their own
6) THEY ARE NOT ODORLESS. After 8 days my house-- with windows open all day-- still STINKS.

 I had to get this stuff off my painting, the entire background done in browns, and was advised by another artist to sand it gently. I got most of it off. Some thick spots were still tacky after 7 days. I had to scrape them with a knife and the paint came off like a waxy crayon-like substance. I could see why it would lift from the feel of this waxy stuff. It would never really adhere especially with other layers of paint. I read the other reviews and I thought ""paid reviewers"" because nothing I read is what I experienced with this horrible, destructive product.",1.0

"I recently bought these water mixable oils and I'm sorry to say they are awful. I have always painted in oils, but hadn't painted in quite a few years so I bought fresh ones. I figured as long as I was buying new paints I might as well try these since they seemed like they would be way less toxic and smelly. Let me just say these paints are not good. At all. The first time I used them I hated what I painted and blamed it on being rusty since I hadn't painted in so long. Well, I just tried to paint with them again tonight and it's definitely not me. They are nearly impossible to mix (I tried the correct medium and tried plain water, both resulted in gloppy paint that never fully mixed), so if you can't get them to mix properly you can just imagine how hard they are to control on a canvas; you can't control them. Maybe if you are a super abstract artist who prefers gloppy, thick paint these will work for you, but I need my paint to be very smooth and easy to control. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on these.",1.0

this set does not provide nearly enough of the white and cream color (just 1 of each) and most of the colors need a mixture of one of these.

I didn't like it koi watercolour is way beTTER,1.0
Disapointed!!! I bought 2 based on reviews and reputation of the company and it was one of the worst watercolor art supply purchase so far. The color are so diluted with cheap fillers. I ended up using 1/4 of the pan just to get a decent depth of color for a wash and it was still light. The ugly graininess was super frustrating too. The cadmium yellow was like more light lemon yellow. This set may be cheap but not a value since I would go through it in 3 paintings. If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone! You cant give it to a child either because the colors are toxic.,1.0

If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone!,1.0
"This set is much smaller than I expected. The tiny pads of paint are seriously smaller than my thumbnail. They measure about 5."" x .3"" and are so small that if you're using a wide brush, you are guaranteed to get paint from the next pad on the brush. The entire boxed set measures 10"" x 5"" - much smaller than expected. It took me almost 2 hours to pop out all of the paint, unwrap and organize them. The printed color chart that comes included in this set of 24 is actually a color chart for the set of 40, so none of the colors correspond. For such a pricey set, I really expected a lot more and am seriously dissappointed. Wish I'd opted for the Full pad set rather than the half pad set. Live and learn.",1.0
"i thought this looked like the perfect way to get some fairly good quality watercolors in a very small, watertight case.

i don't like most of the colors and the pans are so small you'd need to use a size 0 brush to use in this box without mixing one pan with it's neighbors. that ruined it for me.

but the very worst thing is how difficult it is to open the case. i thought it was broken at first, because i had to use so much force to open it. i ended up hurting my fingers when i kept trying to open it.

who wants to use a product that hurts them?!",1.0

"I bought it hoping to have a good mix of colors, it doesn't even have the primary colors like in the picture, it has 2 yellows that are pretty much the same, a green that's more blue than green and 2 shades of brown that are very similar which is not useful. This is not worth the price.",1.0
"Very poor quality manufacturing. That set itself is difficult to open. The cartridges are supposed to be removable but I've nearly torn out my finger tips and nails and they won't budge.

Overall the set feels poorly made and cheap. The paints don't look great either. Can't be sure of their quality because I couldn't test them: because I can't take them out!

This set has come highly recommended by experienced watercolorists. I think its price is pretty unbeatable. Worthwhile if you're on a tight budget and willing to put up with the poor quality. I'm returning it.",1.0

"Got my first X-Acto kit in 1959.  Been using their products ever since, as a licensed professional engineer and as a hobbyist.

Real disappointed with this latest purchase, though.  I really need the box for efficient storage, but the workmanship is so poor that I can't overlook it.

1) The top is warped ... leaves a gap at the front left corner 0.165"".
2) The top relief plate is held in by double side tape until you remove the cellophane wraper to get at the tools.  Now it rattles around loose in the box.
3) The thickness of the relief plates is so thin that the tools easily puncture them when removing and returning.
3) The quality of the clasp is so poor that it is not functional.  The center post is loosly held by the baseplate.  When the toggle is fully engaged, it clicks into place like a ratchet.  Requires two small screwdrivers to release it.

My letter to X-Acto about this remains unanswered.
Wow.  What a mess.",1.0
"Really disappointed in the overall quality of sets I received. I bought this thinking to use the best on my window film installations.

Sent this one back, the replacement set came brand new, sealed in plastic/cardboard... without the #2 holder with blade even in it. Other extra blades were not in place, bounced around. Sent back again. I cannot recommend this product due to such poor quality control.",1.0

"Terrible product from a once great company.

I ordered this set after losing my old Xacto handle.  I don't use these tools often but any hobbyist or tinkerer needs a set.  This product seemed to get pretty good reviews and I'm familiar with the Xacto brand for decades so went ahead and ordered it.

When the set showed up there was no confusion about it being the genuine article, it was in the same blister pack it would be in if it was hanging at the local office supply store.

As soon as I took it out of the package I started to become disappointed.  The tool handles were held in place in the wooden box by a very flimsy plastic clamshell which almost definitely will fall apart if you use the tools regularly.  You basically have to dump the whole insert out and then pop out the tool you want.  Completely unacceptable, especially considering how cheaply they make this stuff in China.  Same story with the knife blades.  They are held into a very thin and flimsy black plastic clamshell insert, you have to tip it out of the case and then pop the blade you want out of the back.  No chance at all you could cut your fingers while doing this.. no sir!

Final two insults.  The wooden box the set arrives with had a latch that didn't even work.  It wouldn't snap or lock into place keeping the lid shut.  I don't leave my tools out but the lid not closing limits where I can store the box without concern.  Then there's the tools themselves.  Cheap construction... very slight tarnishing on the very low grade steel used.  A real disappointment.

"Hi everyone
I've just come across this on my Amazon suggestions and thought id do my good deal for the day by imparting some advice (probebly more for beginners or people buying for presents) this really just isn't the thing to get, i bought a set of these when i first started out as an 'all in one' solution when i first started model making and quite frankly they aren't worth the time, price or effort. aside from quality issues, there are just better ways to buy knives and even though this may look like you get a great choice of blades and handles but quite frankly its almost a gimmick!
In my professional opinion, take the 16 (in the UK) you would waste on these and instead go buy yourself 3 vastly superior knifes that will cover you for almost every job (and you can probably buy a few replacement blades as well for the same price)!
1. a 3 scalpel with 10a surgical blades that you can buy online in bulk for really cheep (its the only type of blade you will almost ever need, their so sharp, cut almost everything and can be used for everything up from fine detail work to accurately cutting huge sheets of foamboard. you can sharpen them if you need to but there so cheep you can just bin them as you go) http://www.amazon.co.uk/Morton-scalpel-handle-No-10a-blades/dp/B004OIAVJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442961697&sr=8-1&keywords=10a+scalpel
2. a 'Stanley Knife' (i think their called that in the US aswell). these are the knives with the trapezoidal blades that slide in an out. dirt cheep, a good all rounder that you can get some power behind if you ever need to. not a lot to say about them but they are a must have (ou P.S, don't get any with a fancy sprung locking mechanism like the one 'forge steel' sells, they will fair on you, just a cheep simple screw together jobbe will do you fine)
3. finally and even this is a more specialised tool, get a box cutter (one of those knives with the long, expendable blades that you can break off when they dull). its certainly not an everyday tool and shouldn't be used for model making especially as they just arnt fine enough but if you ever need to slice through some thick material like foam or polystyrene they are a life saver! the one i currently have is a Stanley one (bright yellow plastic handle with the thicker gauge blades) was not an expensive buy but when i need it its there!

hope this helps anyone!!! good luck (and by the way, the case is crap, get retractable knives if you can if you cant (like the scalpel) get a scrap of leather or two and some duct tape and make a sheath! it will save you a lot of agro and if you then wrap it in the most hi-vis tape you can find you'll never lose your knives again)",1.0

"I had a set of Xacto knives that looked like this one for over 50 years.  I bought them when I was a boy, and built many model planes and boats, and the knives always performed beautifully.  Of course, I bought many, many replacement blades, particularly the classic #2 blade, but the handles lasted and lasted.

After a rather messy divorce, my trusty set of Xacto knives were ""misplaced"".  I  recently had need for knives like these, so I bought a new set.  What a disappointment!

The classic wooden box is now made of some cheap material with a thin veneer over it.  Instead of the fitted wood handle holders inside, there is now a cheap, thin plastic piece that doesn't fit properly.  The magnetic blade holder is, in theory at least, a potential improvement over the old style, but even that is so poorly made it might as well not be there.  The handles - the handles are just badly made.  The chucks don't tighten properly, the aluminum is poorly finished, and the plastic of the large handle has rough casting edges on it that make it very uncomfortable to use.  The blades that used to be the standard for knife edges are now cheaply stamped out, low quality, improperly heat treated, and poorly finished.  The edges are not as sharp as a good pocket knife, and they don't hold an edge like they used to.

Why?  Well, to me, the answer is in a small paper sticker on the box: ""Made in China.""  I understand the Xacto brand name is now owned by Elmer's Products, the maker of Elmer's glue.  Apparently when they bought the brand, they figured it would be cheaper to have the knives made in China and depend on the name they had built up over the previous decades to continue selling them.

I think, from now on, I will not buy anything made by Elmer's.",1.0
"Extremely dissapointed by the xacto handle, specifically the red handled fellow here, and would highly recommend handles from other manufacturers.

5/7/2014:  And I finally found a decent replacement: the Warren Cutlery line of handles and blades.  For $25 I received a decent wood handle with a brass collet, and a variety of useful sharp blades.  The xacto blades shown above will not fit, but some of the others do.  Perfect as a gift, or an upgrade to ones own hobby knife.",1.0
The only thing that is quality about this kit is the Price. In the kit I received the threads on the knife handles are smashed and would not tighten around the blade bases. All of the blades were packaged in a single plastic bag and arrived nicked and damaged. The injection molded plastic parts such as the plane and balsa stripper are useless and literally fall apart in your hand. The only redeeming factor about this kit is that it doesn't take up much room in the trash can.,1.0
"Everything about this product is cheap.  Very disappointed!  I looked at the # of stars on this product and unfortunately did not read the many, many bad reviews...the cheap box, cheap handles. I don't understand why this has 4 stars.  Even though it was a hassle, I returned it.  I suggest everyone that is disappointed with this product do the same.",1.0
"I was stunned Xacto would make such a crap product...I really was.  Basically, I needed a scripto knife, but was looking for a set that also came with a utility saw blade that this set has (no other sets really seem to have the same type).  I would be using the knife for a variety of projects, but once a year--when Halloween comes around--the little saw blade is the most amazing blade for carving (I had one when years ago but can't find it anymore).

At any rate, I ordered this set and it just blows.  I put the saw blade in the black handle and after two saws on a pumpkin, the handle base popped out of the metal blade attachment piece.  This shouldn't come out and isn't made to.  I now have to glue it in so it will hold.  This thing is such a pile of junk.  If I had a bomb and it was legal, I'd completely blow this set up.

Xacto, I now hate your company for producing such garbage!  You should change your name to Crap-Acto!",1.0
"I purchased this kit to get back into carving as i thought it would give me more options compared to the buck knife i used to carve with as a kid.  This thing is junk, the blades are very brital and thin, so quite easy to break; especially the longer ones.  On top of that it is a pain to put the blades in the handle.  The dangerous part us that once they are in the handle, it is a twist to lock the balde into place but the whole blade turns.  The twist lock does not stay tight no matter how hard you can hand tighten it so during short periods of whittling it losens and the blade rotates, sometimes toward your thumb.  Might work if you crank it down with pliers, but that just becomes a pain when you are trying to utilize the variety of blades.  To add, it is not in the slightest bit ergonmoic and is very uncomfortable to carve with. Dont buy this junk; stick with an old fashon folder or upgrade to the Flexcut if you absolutely MUST have a specialty knife.",1.0
If you're only using knives to carve this set is ok.  All the gouges were dull and almost impossible to sharpen.  Not worth the money,1.0
Cheap and nasty don't waste your money flimsy metal blades and a useless box where nothing stays in place rubbish.,1.0
"A waste of money. I wish to know better tools than those... Very small, not for carving wood, perhaps clay ...",1.0
"Just wanted to say that these chisels are junk. I pity someone who develops an interest in wood carving and starts out with this set. They are very poorly ground and as far as I can tell they are made of poor quality metal. I am a seasoned wood carver that can never have too many chisels and gouges. I thought if they were ground poorly, I could regrind them to make tools for special applications. However, the metal is soft, so there is no good reason to do anything with them. Compared to well known carving tools (Swiss Made, old Buck Brothers, etc.) and these are far softer. I question if they are hardened at all. New wood carvers would be far better off with one decent quality chisel than a whole set of these.

Disclaimer: I bought these from a seller on eBay for almost nothing, so I should not complain too much. However, I am writing this review to prevent people from being discouraged with wood carving.",1.0

"Years ago I  bought a set of wood carving tools to use for fairly complex and exacting woodcarving/pattern making; I loved the tools. Recently I decided to return to wood carving and  decided I wanted a set similar to the old ones I was used to. Save your money and don't buy these. The tools themselves were disappointing, They were obviously very cheaply made and the edge they came with was clearly something I would have to work hours on to get a mediocre edge at best.  I love Amazon as I returned these without any hassle. I almost never return anything, but these were junk. My recommendation is to spend a bit more and buy  something with quality. These tools will give  anyone nothing but trouble.",1.0
"20 years ago I owned the exact same set.  So when i wanted to get back into modeling I just ordered another one.

What a mistake.

The box and inserts are already falling apart.

The handles feel flimsy and poorly balanced and are slick
instead of textured like ""vintage"" xacto.

The handles do not seem to grip the blades all that securely.  I almost do not feel safe using them.

At least it has plenty of blades.

There are US manufactured hobby knives that do not cost much more than this junk and are much better quality.",1.0
"While seemingly a nice set, they don't hold up to use in even soft pine. I've snapped two blades with minimal pressure, and several of the rest don't want to stay locked into the twist mechanism of the handle. They continually slide out.

If this is American made, it's shameful. If it's Chinese made, it's typical.

Either way, I am very disappointed with the quality of the blades.

edit: 30 minutes later a 3rd blade has broken. This is absurd.",1.0
"This set was not worth the money. The blades were very weak, 2 of them broke wiithin the first few days and none of the blades fit in the handle right. Everytime I try to carve they come out.",1.0
"I can deal with the handles, but the factory edge is worthless. The burr on some edges makes it feel like carving with a spoon, not a knife. The bevel, such as it is, is so deeply corrugated by the 40-grit wheel that apparently sharpened it that I'll have to grind a lot off to get a truly straight edge on anything.

And then, I'll be down to the steel itself, and how it holds its edge - or doesn't, my hopes aren't up. I should have been more patient and waited for USPS to bring me a decent set of tools. But noooh, I wanted it right away. Serves me right.

"I used to have one of these knife sets years ago but lost it in a move.  It was made with pride in the USA.  Beautiful craftsmanship.  The item I got now is a sad, made in China (ofcourse) piece of garbage. The box is made if some unidentifable sort of plastic made to look somewhat like of wood.  The hinge pin is way too small allowing lots of slop in the lid as though the hinge screws were loose.  The lock ring is so rough it is very difficule to secure the blades. This was addressed at the factory by applying light oil to the threads.  That cure didn't work. The plastic inserts that hold the pieces are a joke. Distorted out of shape gripping the tools way too tightly.  The only good thing I can say is the blades are sharp.  Come on Elmer's, you can do better.  I would gladly pay twice the price for the original quality,",1.0
"JUNK THEY DID NOT COME CLOSE TO FITTING THE KNIFE, AND YES THEY WERE THE RIGHT TYPE.
JUST POORLY MANUFACTURED, I DON'T BELIEVE X-ACTO MADE THEM",1.0
"Although the correct size for my instrument, not all of the blades in the package fit it.  Not worth the hassle to return, but very disappointing.  I actually wondered if this item might be counterfeit,  not actually X-Acto.",1.0
"It doesnt carve wood blocks really at all. I used a rotary tool instead, and it was so much better!",1.0
"I bought these for a print making class, used them once, wouldn't cut very soft thin wood without bending. I am returning it and hopefully finding something that will actually work.",1.0
"It is extremely bad product, Binding is too bad, pages started falling from binder on very first day.",1.0
These don't fit and super poor quality.  They do not allow returns,1.0
This is actually only 5 pages- thought it would be 10. Way over priced!,1.0
The size was not what was represented and didn't fit the album like it was supposed to.  I had to send it back.,1.0
"I bought these refill pages to add to a standard two-post album. The holes in these refills are cut for a custom size, not a standard two post. I ended up having to cut notches in the existing holes to get them to fit. The pages now look terrible.",1.0
I bought these refills last year hoping I could just slip my mother's old pages into it.  I did end up changing my mind and put those in another album but I wanted to use this one for something else.  I do not believe these refills received much wear and tear but now I've  found about half the pages have to be replaced because they have torn loose at the holes.  Needless to say I am NOT happy and very frustrated.  and I'm not sure I'll be able to find refills of this size anywhere else.,1.0
These do not fit 12X12 paper . You have to cut off about  1/8 of an inch of  to get it to fit. I was really unhappy with this purchase.,1.0
So not worth it. I regret this buy. I would get something else if I could do it over again.,1.0
This are listed as 2.4 ounce Value Size but they are infact .88 ounce the same as the normal size that is sold cheaper by other sellers,1.0
It doesn't stick. It was such a waste of money. I'm just going to have to throw it away.,1.0
This is double the cost of getting this at a craft store and nearly double of what it costs at other websites.  Total ripoff.,1.0
"Maybe it's because of the brand of album I was using, but these Pioneer inserts did not fit. Once I inserted them into the album (following the company's own instructions), a 12 x 12 sheet of paper would not fit in the sleeve without being bent. They do not have the extra half-inch between the sleeve and the holes, and this is necessary (otherwise part of the sleeve is covered by the binding of the album, and everything in the album gets bent when you flip through it). Although the packaging said it could be used with a post-style album, it's clear these are made only for 3-ring binders and nothing else.

It's a difficult issue to explain, so I hope this makes sense. I was told at Michael's that they would fit ""any 12 x 12 album,"" and this is simply not true. I also found the plastic to be very flimsy.",1.0
Sorry I bought two of these for even with a thick thorough application 8x10 photos separated from the mat board.  A waste of money!,1.0
So gross there were dead bloody bugs stuck to the papers,1.0
Purchased this item to do t-shirts printed the picture but paper wouldn't transfer image over to t-shirt.  Mercerdise was old recommended no one to purchase Amazon gave me $1.17 refund for this item,1.0
"Ordered this because I liked the older product (2012 on package).  November 2016 order of different quality, opposite of former.
Just opened one of the five packs I had ordered.
Photos don't come out sharply, more like water color, with long time for ink drying.  Will not order this again unless old quality can be guaranteed.",1.0
"bought at ac Moore ... To do a project for a client. Ive used other brands before and this is by far the most horrible brand ever. After following instructions to a T... The pictures lifted and some came off . I lost so much money . I will never use this brand again , nor would i recommend it to anyone else.",1.0
The worst transfers I have ever used. Had to buy new fabric and throw everything away and my house stunk for hours. Did not adhere completely when following instructions.. I had to iron less than one sheet for TWENTY MINUTES for it to adhere and it yellowed horribly and STILL tore up at the corners. Furious.,1.0
"I used the transfer on to a maroon shirt, the design had significant amounts of white and now the design has significant amounts of maroon. It could not have worked worse. So not only does the transfer not work as advertised, the shirt is ruined as well. Thanks so much, Printworks.",1.0
"I would give these 0 stars if I could.  I have used Jolene's transfers and had no issues, but I ruined a Christmas gift with these. Unlike Jolene's, which actually transfer the ink..... these leave a very cheap and plastic feeling transfer.  Sadly, as I said, I now have to spend MORE money and make a tie dye shirt all over again, buy the not crappy transfers and hope I can get it done in time.

Don't waste your money on these!",1.0
This product is aweful I followed instructions to the letter and the transfer came out yellow and started separating before I wore it. I wouldn't recomend at all.,1.0
The material was old and dry.  Not useful.  I would appreciate my money back in full.,1.0
"these wash off in a couple washes, no matter how closely you follow instructions.  If you really want to do this kind of thing, buy yourself a low cost heat press (iron won't cut it) and use appropriate heat transfer paper.",1.0
"We just got these and were hoping it would work on our dark shirts. The instructions say and I quote ""Cut out design: Trim your image as close to the edge of your printed design as possible. Any border will be WHITE on your fabric...

Now isn't that a normal WHITE T-Shirt Transfer!!!!

DON'T BUY!",1.0
didnt workat all i tried all sorts of ways and no good .i evean took it to the dry cleaners and blah,1.0
"Seems like a quality product at first, but when you load it in to the printer the edges curl up and do not properly feed. When the printing begins and ends the corners of the paper end up smudged. I was afraid it would get stuck! Not recommended for full page transfers, but may work better on smaller designs printed on the center on the page. I wasted a lot of precious ink on these!!!",1.0
"these did not work at all.  after application and ironing, they left a pattern on the fabric from decal not attaching fully or properly to the fabric.  tried all the sheets, no luck with any.  save your money, don't purchase",1.0
"Wow. These didn't work at all for me. After reading the rest of the comments, I feel like maybe I got a defective batch or something. Followed the directions to a T (haha) but the shirts I used (dark blue and green) completely swallowed up the ink-- you really could barely see that anything was ironed on there. I felt like I was using transfers for white shirts. (I wasn't. They were dark tshirt transfers, unless someone pulled the old switcharoo on me.) Guess I'll try a different brand. Pretty bummed about these.",1.0
What I need to do is print a few words and transfer those to dark colored t-shirts. Looks like this will work for shapes and you have to cut the shape and transfer it to the t-shirt like a sticker. It does not work for my purpose to transfer only what is printed. I imagine it would work well on white t-shirts since you would paste white on white.,1.0
"This really made me mad when I realized that whatever image or word you print, unless it is an identical match when folded in half, needs to be edited so that it's mirrored...not as easy as I thought it would be. Buy the brand Avery instead...
More $=Better Quality + Easier to Use",1.0
"This is the first review I've ever written for a product ever. I was prompted to do so because I think that this is worst product I've ever purchased. I have used avery t-shirt transfers for many years, they're not the greatest but they usually hold up to a couple months worth of washes. With this product I was pleased with the way the transfer printed and transferred and everything still would have been fine until I washed the shirt found the image disintegrated after 1 wash in cold water.  My many hours of work designing, printing, and ironing are all wasted not to mention the sad look on the face of the little boy I was making the t-shirts for. I will be returning this. For the few extra bucks you save it is not worth it, you will be sorry.",1.0
"I have made iron-on t-shirts for years with great success. Yes they do wear out fast if you use a washing machine. I only hand wash cold, inside out. I just used Printworks for the first time (they were on sale). It printed easy, ironed-on very nicely but when I washed it for the first time and let it air dry the graphic peeled off! I never had that happen before! Maybe it is bad quality paper, I don't know but won't buy it again.",1.0
"I was very disappointed in this product.
The printing looks good, but after ONE wash it begins to crack, flake, and fade.  I have used Avery product before and it did crack after several washing, but you can still see the iron-on pretty clearly.  This product didn't even last two washings...washed in cool water with the shirt turned inside out.
The iron-on process doesn't go smoothly either.  I had to iron for SO long to get the transfer made completely, that I ended up scorching a couple of them.
I would not recommend this product to anyone.",1.0
"NOT happy with this one - my three year old son and I tried to make the imprint of his hands in the gel mold this evening and it was nothing but a HUGE mess.  Instructions tell you to immediately put their hands/feet in the gel mold so it can form around their hand.  Sounded simple enough except for the fact that we sat there waiting and waiting with NO drying.  I can't blame my son, he got impatient with it and started sliding his hand and crinkling his fingers and all we had left was a slimy hand and a few dried pieces of gel in the mold.  I think that if we had waited for the gel to dry more it would have been better but you only have one chance to get it right and if you follow the directions it will be botched.

One Mothers Day present down the drain.  Sadly - it was the only one, I am VERY disappointed in this product.",1.0
"We purchased this craft to use a gift from my 8 month old daughter to her grandmother - what a joke!  After my baby was asleep we tried to ""imprint"" her foot (thinking that it would be easier than her hand) - the wait time for the gel to dry was well over 1 minute, and wouldn't you know - baby woke up and the whole thing was a huge mess.  The entire craft is now in the trash and we have nothing to show for our hellacious attempts.  DO NOT BUY unless your child is old enough to understand holding his or her hand still and can do this for more than a minute.",1.0
"It's beautiful and blends right in with my wooden desk. If you like simple and elegant, this is for you. It stays in place on my desk nicely with the included pads installed. It's a phone stand, not really for charging your phone.",5.0
"I love this stand! I had been looking around for a phone case that would fit my phone and had a kickstand, but this was even better. Not only can you use your phone on this, but you can use tablets and most other devices as well. While the phones sit perfectly in the rack, the tablets would hang over a tad and may seem overpowering, but with the 4 grippers that came with it, it will hold it up perfectly. The grippers work really well in holding this stand steady so that your devices won't fall over because they are too heavy for this stand. I love this stand because it is hands free meaning I could pop a recipe up on my phone or tablet and be able to do everything it says without having to touch the device. I was given the opportunity to receive this stand for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.",5.0
"This is a very basic stand. I bought 2, one for my desk at work and one for my end table by the bed. It's inexpensive and does the only thing I need it to do, hold my phone up. When it's charging I turn it landscape.

I love this little vacuum . For starters..this vacuum DOES fit in the bag. I attached a photo of mine showing how I place the items in the bag to get them to fit to help anyone out who may have problems with this bc I noticed on some reviews people say the stuff won't fit in the bag. The bag is small so you can't just throw everything in however you please or it won't fit. You gotta play Tetris with it and figure out how to fit it all just right. My picture shows the way I figured out how to place everything to get things to fit right and be able to zip the bag back up every time. So hopefully that will help future buyers. But this vacuum has worked great for maintaining cleanliness of my vehicle. Now my suv was destroyed inside . it was sooo dirty from months and months of dirt and dropped food pieces from the kids that we literally had to take a shop vac to it to get it cleaned or this little vacuum prob would have took forever to clean it. This little vacuum is not really made for super heavy duty jobs. Its more made to maintain keeping your vehicle clean after its already been heavy duty cleaned. But once I got the inside of my suv fully cleaned...I now use this once a week to go over the seats and carpets and dash area etc and it sucks up the dust and dirt in the carpets and seats etc just fine. My driver side floor gets pretty dirty after a week from dirt and it has no problems getting it clean. But like I said if your vehicle is very very dirty you may want to pull our your shop vac and save you some time and then just use this little guy once a week to keep it nice and clean. Great buy for the price for a simple vacuum to maintain vehicle interior cleanliness.,5.0

"So glad I bought this. It comes with a bag and a few attachments. The bag is great because I just leave it in my car and it doesn't take up too much room.
It plugs into your car's cigarette lighter/socket (whatever you want to call it). And the cord is fascinatingly long for easy use all around the car. It has a light you can turn on if it's dark.
The attachments it comes with is:
- A slightly longer, skinner nozzle to reach difficult spots
- A very long stretchy, bendable hose to give it more length
- A small broom-like nozzle (I'm guessing to use on your dashboard or other areas)
- A replacement filter, which is so nice to have.
- The bag of course

All in all, its way easier to use than to go to a car wash.

Must get for parents! We have two little ones and every time we get them in the car we have to make sure to bring lots of snacks. The problem with having little ones is that half the time the snacks falls to the floor and the other half lands in their car seat. So any parent should really have something like this so they can keep their car in a reasonable condition. It comes with a cord so you can vacuum underneath the driver and passenger seats and you can charge it with the cigarette lighter in the car.

"I had this listed on my wish list for several months  before I finally bought it. I lose my keys fairly often and looked like a good solution. I was fairly skeptical about how well it would work since I have several keys on my key ring, and was unsure it it could hold the exta weight. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. It attaches to the wall easily and quickly, and holds 2 sets of keys without any issues.",5.0

This vac has made it so simple for her to clean inside. She actually stores it in her car and uses it when she gets a wash during lunch. She's a tough customer, but she absolutely loves it.

"(Updated: The first unit I received died after 3 minutes of use; however, the company responded promptly to my problem and sent me a replacement. So this updated review is for the working unit.)

The HOTOR is a good lightweight car vacuum that is easy to use, easy to clean, and has a bevy of useful attachments. It has adequate suction for its weight. You could get much more suction if you give up the convenience of having a lightweight device that is easy to manage inside a car, where space is limited (some of the reviewers that complain about the suction should take into consideration that greater suction means a heavier and more expensive motor is needed, thus you lose ease of handling in tight quarters and inexpensive acquisition cost.)

The entire unit has a nice storage bag that, given its light weight, I keep in the trunk all the time. And speaking of the thunk, the cord is long enough that you can easily reach it and vacuum back there too.",5.0

"PROS:
- Easy clean and durable filter (have not even burned through the first one yet)
- Good suction (always use it with the car running for best results)
- LED light is useful even in midday, because you wouldn't otherwise be able to see near the peddles, behind the seats, etc.)
- Variety of tools and convenient carry bag
CONS:
- Crevice tool could be skinnier or longer",5.0
"The vacuum comes with extended soft pipe, brush head, and a plastic extending head with a narrower opening. The wire is long enough to make sure the vacuum can reach to any point in my car. With the brush header, sticky debris can be removed easily.  For on seat debris, it is good to just use plastic narrow header to clean.  Overall really good vacuum to clean my car.",5.0
"Cheap product which may last hopefully few weeks! After switching off the device it produces very strange sounds as if something inside going to fall off.

UPDATE: The HOTOR offered to replace the damaged item and even refund expenditure. For this reason I'm marking up form 1 to 5 stars because the customer service is simply unbeatable !",5.0
"Works alright. The little brush helps a lot. It will take you about 30 minutes to vacuum the cars seat and floor if you're a ride-sharing driver. You'll still see a bit dirt after finished but it's really an insignificant amount. After you place the rugs back on, it will look good.",5.0

"Practical products
1: My family have a baby in the house, he often eats in the car, so the car is very dirty. The vacuum cleaner makes it easy and easy to absorb the food scraps
2: also bring a tire to pump the equipment, save to go to the gas station to pump gas",5.0
"Product: 4.5/5 stars
Pros:
-Various tips and connectors makes getting into the tight crevices an easy job.
-Very good suction for a handheld tool.
-Power cable is long enough to reach all the way to the trunk easily.
-The design makes cleaning the unit a simple job.
-Extra filter is a nice perk.

Cons (very small issues):
-Be careful when using the long flexible tube. Mine unscrewed halfway during use. But, I realized it was probably mostly because I kept twisting the hose around. Also, it easily screwed back in and can probably be held in place with a little duct/electrical tape.
-The storage bag is slightly small, but ONLY by a tiny bit. The current size makes storing all the pieces a bit of a jigsaw challenge to get everything to fit properly. This is only a comment for future upgrade improvements as everything does fit into the included storage bag.

Customer service: 5/5 stars
To start, I purchased this product with my own money. I believe a company's customer service and confidence in their product is essential to any purchase, big or small.

"Disclaimer: I bought this with my own money. I don't know these people. I just felt like writing this review because most of the reviews for this item are suspiciously positive and written in questionable English.

I bought this because I'm somewhat obsessive about keeping my car clean, and it was getting silly pumping quarters into the gas station's vacuum every week. Now that I got to try it out for the first time, I have to say that it works as well as I expected. First thing you should know is that it isn't terribly strong. It can't be. No vacuum running off of a low-wattage 12v power source like your car's cigarette lighter will ever be powerful. Don't compare it to a house vacuum or the gas-station vac which is easily consumes 10x the current. You'll be disappointed. What this thing is good for is vacuuming up normal amounts of dirt/sand from the carpet and dust from the center console, especially that weird dust that falls to the bottom of the cupholders and in the shift boot (dead skin cells I'm told). In fact it in a way it's a bit more effective than the gas station vac because of the brush attachment, and the fact that the nozzle can fit into smaller areas. The brush attachment makes all the difference in the world. The LED also light is actually quite helpful for seeing what you're doing in the darker parts of your car.

What it's NOT good for is sucking up 4lbs of Cheerios off the floor of a minivan. So if you have kids and routinely need to clean up massive messes, this might not do it for you.

Pro tip: Have your engine running while you use it. The system voltage is higher (usually around 14volts vs 12volts with the engine off) and the vac will be a little stronger.",5.0

"I needed a car vacuum for my jeep having a dog they loves to ride and a construction worker husband I needed one they worked well and had tools. I researched first and decided on the Hotar.
It arrived and I was excited to test it out to see how it would work in my home first! Wow! It really works well! It has the tools you need. And will pick up everything even salt poured on your carpet! ( see photos) I'm quite impressed and fully recommend the Hotor Brand. This plugs into your cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle and has a long enough cord to use. There's a spare filter as well. It comes with a storage bag so you can safely keep it in your car without losing parts.
I think it is also well made and durable. No loose parts or screws noticed.
I'm happy with my purchase!",5.0

"Being a mom, my car seems to always have little crumbs in the seats and dirt on the floor!! I really needed a vacuum that I could easily and quickly clean these messes up.  I found this vacuum to be amazingly convenient!! I love that it just plugs right into the car and even has a little storage case so you can keep all the accessories together in one place.
The vacuum itself works very nicely.  It has great suction and gets up anything I need it to.  It comes with 3 attachments to suit any need and can be used for wet or dry applications.
I have to say, my favorite part about this vacuum is that it doesn't have a battery! All the other handheld vacuums I've had before had such a short battery life and had to be charged forever! Not this one!!
Overall, I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it!!",5.0
Works wonderful and so easy,5.0

"Very powerful little machine! I needed a second portable vacuum for my second car. I love the fact that the system comes with a stylish  carrying case which keeps the vacuum neatly contained. The colors of the unit itself make you feel like you're giving your vehicle the VIP treatment. The suction work great, as do the attachments. They are easy to use and use for the various spaces that need its attention. I was surprised and happy that the company included an extra air filter! Even happier that it is a wet/dry vac which was a fact that I missed reading about prior to my ordering! It was a lifesaver already though since my kids failed to inform me that there was wet sand in the back of my vehicle! Whew! crisis averted! I really like this item!",5.0

Very handy and super easy to use. It is lightweight and easy to carry. I like it because it not only woke for dry dirt and debris but also absorb liquid. I always struggle how to clean the dust in my car but before but with this  car vacuum that makes my life so much easier. I definitely recommend this vacuum.,5.0
"Great suction for cleaning power. The extension hose and brush end are a great combo for car mats with deep grooves, the factory carpeting and also the grooves in the seat cushions. The long cord reaches from the front all the way to the back cargo area. The filter is easy to clean between uses and it all fits nicely into the included zipper case. I used a twist wrap to bundle up the cord for packing away. Best of all you never have to worry about recharging because it plugs into the car outlet. I use it 2x-3x per week to keep the car spotless.",5.0

"I have updated this review to rate the customer service of this company. They stand behind their products, and go to EXTREME measures to earn and keep your business. You can bank on satisfaction here. If something goes amiss, or you're just not satisfied, THESE PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT RIGHT! Do not hesitate.. buy buy buy! Now as far as the product, I love it, but only for lite jobs. If you're looking for an emergency, lite duty cleaner then this is TOP QUALITY. However if you're looking for a more powerful unit, THERE IS ONE AVAILABLE. Look up HOTOR 4-in-1. Thank you HOTOR for making my experience A++! I am thankful I chose you!",5.0
"This is an amazing vacuum! It works extremely well. I tried it on my vehicles carpet floor the day it came in and it worked wonders. I had dirt and dry mud all over my carpet floor thanks to my siblings and I was able to get it all out. The price is just right and I love that I went with this one after much research in looking to buy a car vacuum. The blue color is really nice, sleek, and attractive looking. It plugs into the car's outlet so it is very convenient. The cord is long so no need to worry that it won't reach the back of your car because it will! It comes with many extra accessories. I'm excited about it having a tire inflator. I might not be using it much but it's great for backup in case of emergencies. It's really lightweight and makes the cleaning so much easy. I'm keeping it in the trunk of my car in the bag it comes with. My only concern is that the flashlight is in a spot where it kept almost turning off because my hand would rest on it while vacuuming at night but it's not a deal breaker or anything. I am completely in love with it and I highly recommend! My only trouble was that it was missing the valve tube but I got that resolved with Amazon. Look no further into buying another vacuum because this one is it!",5.0

"Although I now own several diffuser necklaces and have more than enough pads, the first necklace I bought only came with 2 pads, so I immediately needed more. I found these pads to be a very good price and I love the different colors. Plus they fit in all three of my necklaces, which were all purchased from different companies. I sometimes choose which pad to use based on what my outfit is for the day, and other times by whatever scent I have previously applied. I've also found that they do a great job of maintaining the scent for several days without needing to be replenished. And they are also very thick and well made. Overall I would highly recommend these pads to anyone who owns a diffuser necklace.",5.0

It helps me clean my truck and gets into all the nooks and crannies on cleaning days. I like that it has a long extension cord to plug into the cigarette lighter. The attachments come in pretty handy too.,5.0
"Updated and shortened review:
Had this vac for over a month now and really like it.  There are other vacs with good ratings that are just that.  I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.

I use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.

What I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.  Plenty of cord for your own car, and with a simple 25' extension you can easily clean a friend's car from your cig lighter. (Saves on gas with a prius as the generator! :))",5.0
Very nice! Easy to use!,5.0
"So glad I got this for our car! After my husband and I cleaned out our car this last weekend, we used this vacuum to get all the dirt and crumbs and dust out. It worked great! The only problem I had, was that it didn't plug in very securely, so it would come unplugged easily. Other than that, it was perfect for our needs. It has a nice long cord  and all the necessary attachments, so you can get every inch of your car clean. Empties easily and has a replaceable and washable filter... even comes with one replacement. This is a wet and dry vacuum, so it can even be used to clean up your spilled coffee or pop (or whatever it is you drink). The vacuum, with all of its attachments, fit nicely the included bag for easy storage and transport. This new vacuum now has a permanent home in my car.",5.0

After researching on Amazon, I bought this HOTOR 4in1 Car Vacuum Cleaner since it also comes with a tire pressure monitor and pump.
The package comes with quite a few things. There are HOTOR Car Vacuum Cleaner, Extension Hose, Brush Attachment, valve tube, Operation Manual, Carrying Bag, and 3 different Pump Tips for Inflation. The attached cigarette car charger comes with a pretty long cord at 14.76 feet. There are 3 buttons on top of the vacuum cleaner. The button in the front is a release button for the dirt bin and to access the filter. The button (switch) on the handle has 3 modes - Vacuum, OFF, and Pump. The very last button activates LED light. There is no home AC output adapter included in the package.
PROs:
- Wet/Dry cleaner. This vacuum works with dirt as well as liquid. This comes very handy after rainy or snowy days.
- Good suction. The vacuum is rated at 100W and it's able to pickup most dirt/ food leftover on my car's carpet and chairs, except those ones that are really sticky. It picks up hairs as well but I usually have to try a few times.
- Bonus tire pressure monitor, pump, and pump tips. It's nice that HOTOR included a few different types of tips in the package so I can use this to pump balloons, balls, and kids' bike tires when we're outside. I haven't tried using the pump to pump car tires but it might be too difficult for a small unit like this.
- LED light. There is a LED light near the front part of the handle. It's quite useful in the dark and when I am trying to clean up the car inside garage.
- Washable filter. I prefer using filters that's washable as it saves money in the long run. There is also a handle on the back of filter for easier removal. There is only one filter included in the package though.",5.0
"I just received this today as i was cleaning out my truck.  Perfect time to try it out. I was really happy with this vacuum.  Plenty of power to suck up leaves, sand and a few bubble gum wrappers lol.
I'm attaching a few pictures of what i got in the package.  The quality is really better than expected.  All the accessories fit tightly  and there is no air leaks anywhere. I like the carrying case and everything fits in it perfectly.  The cord is super long! I give this 5 stars no doubt and highly recommend it if you are looking for one of these.",5.0

I am not to concerned with the suction of the attachment the vacuum itself worked great and will make it so much easier to clean up my messy kids crumbs and dirt. I would still recommended this car vacuum based on the size is perfect and the suction on the actual vacuum worked great and I was very happy with that. I look forward to cleaning my car easily in the future.",5.0
I just purchased the car vacuum and am very pleased with it. The vacuum has sufficient power to pick up dirt in my car and I like that it's got a long cord to plug into my cigarette lighter (12v).

This vacuum also comes with a nice carrying case and hose extension to reach even the toughest areas in the car! I love the design, it's very easy to hold and use and it is super simple to change and clean the filters. The design makes it easy to get in between seat cracks and the suction power really is great! I can suck up an entire bottle of water and then dumb it right out the window!

"I have bought this Car Vacuum from Hotor to clean my vehicles.. This kit came with its own carry case, the vacuum, a hose attachment with two other attachments.. First of all I love the fact that it came with its own carrying case so that wverything will be all togther in one bag and easy to just grab and go.. The vacuum itself is very light weighted and no to heavy to where you'll have a hard tume maneuvering it around your car.. The attachments is a plus to catch all other difficult places that you cant reach with the vacuum and the brush one to get up any dust or any particles stuck to the surfaces.. The plug is a lighter plug in so yes you can just leave it in your vehicle to use at anytime.. All in all I think everyone should have ine in their car hust to have..",5.0

"I previously owned a Dirt Devil Hand Held Vaccum that i used in my car to pick up waste from food thrown out by my 1 yr old and various other debris from shoes not to mention hair. After 3 years of service it finally died on me (Well could not ask for more of its service for the $30 i spent on it).

Was scouring through amazon for a decent vaccum cleaner and i stumbled upon this product. Since amazon has got my back, ordered this product  and i am definitely not disappointed with my decision to go with this bad boy.

Not only it did a better job than my dirt devil to pick up debris on my car floor but it coupled as tire inflator and as well an emergency led light in case of situations.

The product itself came in a nice little portable pouch that can house the contents of the product and get tucked in nicely in my trunk. My only question that i need to contact the seller is how often do we need to change the HEPA filter (Asking this as my previous vaccum cleaner is a no filter model) and if there would be cheap as it wouldnt make sense to spend a bomb on the filter when the vaccum cleaner itself is inexpensive

I also tried the pointed attachments to inflate my volley ball just for the heck of it and it worked awesome :)

Like the product description mentioned, it came in with all the attachments. Build quality itself is very good and i am super sure this will last for more than what my dirt devil did. Overall, it is a great purchase and i hope it won't need to claim warranty and that it runs for a long time to come.

My verdict: Must have in your car if you got kids",5.0
"I really, really love this car vacuum. Not only is it super convenient, it works awesome. I have 3 children under 8, youngest is 2, and they make a lot of messed with snacks in my car.

"There isn't anything bad I can say about this pendant. It is well made, good quality stainless steel, and even the chain is nice. For most pendants the chain is an afterthought, and most of the time I discard the chain and use one of my own. It is a long chain, suitably thick, and works well with the pendant. The pendant is heavy, and it is fairly large, but I think I like it that way. However, if you are looking for something small and discrete, this won't be a good pendant for you. It is definitely a statement piece. The included pads are thick and absorb a lot of oil. As I received the pendant today, I can't speak for their washability, but you can find replacement pads online that are relatively inexpensive. I will add on to the review if I have any issues with the pads. Overall, a quality buy, and the price is low considering what you get.",5.0

"This diffuser is so quiet you'll never realize it has turned itself off due to being dry. I love the fact that I can fill this baby up and it runs all night. It will turn itself off if it gets empty, and I like that feature. There are settings for roughly 30 minutes to an hour, but I haven't used those setting because I like a continuous run of the essential oils; so I put it on the ""run until I'm out of water"" setting. The colors are very nice and soothing, but those can also be turned off for bedtime. If you want a unit that puts out a good stream, run quietly in the background, and turns itself off when the water has been depleted, then this is your unit.",5.0

They all had one common problem - the battery. Rechargeable battery life is not holding up very long on these devices, and it takes several hours to recharge it. Most of the time when you need to vacuum, often the vacuum is dead because out of battery.

This Hotor DC 12 Volt 106 watts Wet and Dry handheld vacuum with long power cord eliminates that problem. Not only vacuum dry debris, this vacuum also can vacuum wet items or liquid spills. When you ready to vacuum, the battery (capacity) is not the limit. You can vacuum much longer and ready to go at anytime. Best of all, there is air filter to prevent dust going out on the other end  this is might help if people have minor allergies (note: I believed the filter is not HEPA). Besides that great feature, the extension hose, crevice tool and brush attachment work perfectly.

Pros:
-  DC 12 volt (no battery problems)
-  Wet and Dry Vacuum
-  Portable
-  Lightweight
-  Long car lighter cable (16.5 feet)
-  Easy to empty dust bowl
-  Easy to Use and handle

It comes with a carry case to keep it contained.
CONS:
Wish the suction was bit stronger but still gets the job done.

Overall, this will come in handy and having this will get the job done.

"Color I received was actually ""walnut"" but either way this little stand works great with an iPhone 7 Plus in the Apple leather case. This item now comes with self-adhesive silicone pads (four) so it will be non-slip and sit better on most surfaces. The finish is nearly perfect with no un0smoothed edges or surfaces. They actually spend time to craft this little thing. For the price and my free Prime 2-day shipping, I liked this so much I ordered another one and I'm considering another spare before they are gone.",5.0

"The diffuser is a little bigger than I expected.  It holds a good bit of water.  I like the light, which can be set on one color or leave it to alternate through several different colors, or have no light at all.  There are three different mist levels.  On the lowest level it will last about 6 hours.  On the lowest level it has lasted for more than 8 hours.  It will automatically shut off once the water is gone.  You can also set it for several different time options.",5.0

"I was a little hesitant reading the reviews buying this. But, this works awesome! I use it to vacuum my minivan every Saturday. I have young kids and it picks everything up and it's easy to dump.",5.0

I ran it through my entire car and it performed well. I was able to vacuum up dust on the dash and steering wheel. But what I liked was that I could get the dust out of the radio buttons and air vents with the brush attachment. I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure. I grabbed some sand and threw in on the floor to demonstrate how well it vacuums for you in case you were wondering too. But overall, I do recommend this vacuum cleaner and I would purchase this again. I will update my review it quits working within a few months. But so far it seems good.",5.0
"My first aromatherapy necklace. I had wanted to use a wax warmer at work for relaxation, but got many complaints from my coworkers. I wanted something that I could use for relaxation while at work, so I bought this to give it a shot. I love the size and weight. I immediately used it for a menthol device when I got a cold as well. It's a great idea and I don't have to cover myself in vapor rub. I wouldn't have thought to use it for that purpose but people on pinterest recommended it. Great idea",5.0

And I call it my toy because it is just so much fun to use! This one vacuum has:

1) DRY VAC for cleaning up dirt and spills tracked into the car.

2) WET VAC for cleaning up any spills in a quick hurry!

3) BRUSH ATTACHMENT to comb the carpet or brush the upholstery.

4) INFLATION TIPS -- ball needle, air mattress, etc.

5) TIRE PUMP to inflate flat tires with built-in tire pressure gauge on the rear of the vacuum

6) LIGHT built-in to the vacuum for added convenience

7) EXTENSION HOSE for those hard to reach places

8) CARRYING CASE

It is so easy to plug the vacuum into the charging port of the car and clean up any mess that may be in the car or inflate my kid's flat soccer ball or even top off my tires when needed. There isn't anything that this compact vacuum can't do! And when I'm done having my fun, all I have to do is pack it back up into its compact storage bag and slide it up under the seat...it's so compact it is impossible to even tell that it is there!

The biggest surprises for me were 1) that it was strong enough to actually inflate the tires of my large SUV and 2) that the vacuum had enough suction to remove pet hair from the carpet!

The biggest surprise for my friends is when a ball needs to be inflated at soccer practice and I pull out a vacuum and proceed to inflate balls in a matter of seconds. The shock and awe is too funny...then it immediately turns into ""where did you get that???""

This vacuum has been a huge hit!! I LOVE it and all of my friends who have seen it have really been taken with it. It's so easy to have fun with this multi-tool :)

The crevice attachment cracked and will no longer suck up anything from the car and the vacuum itself only works about 40% of the time.

I normally don't rate or review items I buy.  I've never really liked or disliked an item enough to do so.  Until now.  I purchased this item to do little quick vacuums in between my car cleanings without having to pull my husband's big shop vac around.  I just basically threw that money away.  This thing is horrible.  I think it drops out just as much sand as it picks up if you don't hold it a certain way.  It won't even pick up little pebbles!  And it's not like the sand is in carpet so it's hard to pick it up.  I have Weather Tech mats and it will hardly grab the sand off of it.  Do not waste your money on this thing.  I really don't see a use for it at all.,1.0

No response about the malfunctioning unit. I will never buy this again because the power cord broke after two months of usage.

The customer service rep Reabee was very prompt in fixing the problem. I had a new vacuum within 3 days of writing my original complaint. I promised to update my review. I'd impressed with the follow up and the quick replacement.

The first day I used it, I plugged it into my car's cigarette lighter while the car was running. I vacuumed the back seat and the floor boards and I could smell a burning smell. I think the motor is overheating. I'm going to contact the company if possible (I don't know if this will be difficult to do or not) and try to get a replacement.",1.0

I wish the vac was stronger than it is. I am very disappointed in this product. I don't recommend unless you have very very very little dirt in your car. It's not strong WHATSOEVER.

Received. Took it out of the box. Attachment pieces do not fit on the hose.

"After reading several Amazon reviews on this product, I purchased it and I have to tell you I am very disappointed. This vacuum doesn't have enough suction (whether you're using it with or without the brush attachment) to pick up much beyond fluffy lint. I just had tiny bits of dirt and leafy debris I wanted to vacuum out of my new car, but this couldn't even handle that. And just so we're clear, I'm talking about dirt no bigger than 2 - 3 mm and leafy debris no bigger than 1 - 2 cm (and not that many pieces of them either), so this the vacuum should've been able to handle it quite easily. But it didn't.

On the bright side, the light is very bright and you'd have no problem seeing the area you're trying to vacuum. I didn't try the tire inflator or pressure features, so I cannot speak to them.",1.0

"I've been waiting almost a month for these to arrive and was so excited to get them that I can't even describe the disappointment I felt when I opened the box. Initially I was impressed because they looked just like the photo. On closer inspection though they just didn't hold up.

First the silver one. It wouldn't even OPEN! No matter how hard I tried I couldn't pry it open with just my hands. I had to use two pairs of jewellery pliers and actually apply quite a bit of force to get it to open. I was hoping that it was just a bit stiff the first time I tried opening it, however I have to use the pliers each time.  The finish too is not up to the quality I expected for the price. I know that it's not real silver so it may eventually tarnish however when you turn this locket around its already tarnished and looks like it's been worn.

The bronze one isn't any better. While I can open it this one looks even more used. Not only is it also tarnished on the back already it looks well worn. The hinges have some""thing"" in them. It looks like grease and maybe fibers though I'm not sure what exactly it is. They may just be fibers but it looks like someone got their hair caught in the hinges and just cut it out. Not attractive at all.

I was hoping to give these as a gift and was so excited that I even purchased another set in another design and I'm worried that those are going to be just as bad. Neither one of these can be gifted and they're barely wearable. From the other reviews it seems that this product is hit or miss on whether it arrives in good condition or not. I really can't recommend these based on what I received but I sincerely hope that I lucked out on the next set because these are just too disappointing.",1.0
"How this item got 5 stars is beyond me. It had a problem picking up six little quarter inch pieces of dried leaves from the carpet in my vehicle. Calling it a toy is an insult to toys.

"I found it to be an extremely detailed service manual accompanied with mostly smallish black and white photos aimed at mechanics and service providers. Volume and weight capacities were expressed in metric, however, conversion tables were provided. Most appreciated were the service schedules. The manual lacked the basic operational details I was seeking.

After purchasing the Service and Repair Manual I opted to purchase the Triumph ""Owner's handbook"" from the Parts Department of my local Triumph dealer.

"Unlike the Clymer KLR manual I reviewed earlier this one sucks. Bad organization, blurry photos, and convoluted text make this the absolute worst manual ever.

Delivery from Amazon was quick and for a hard-bound book the price seemed fair. Still I'd say don't waste your money, look for something better.",1.0

I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a.  I picked it because of the 2000 publication date.  BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.,1.0

"This book has proven almost completely useless when it comes to the specifics of a given repair.  It is better as an extremely general guide to repair.  It, for example, did not give an accurate location, or any location at all, for the pcv valve, computer module, fuel schrader valve, or fuel filter.  It did not mention anything about having to take the passenger front tire off to change the spark plugs and the serpentine belt.  It instructions tend to be overly simplified and/or vague.  There is very little in the way of any sort of technique to use or things to look out for.  I found some forums on the internet that did a much more thorough and respectable job than this p.o.s. and the people there didn't charge you for the info.  It is good for a couple of things.  It does provide torque, pressure, and other specifications as well as diagnostic code definitions, not that you couldn't google it for free.  In short: this book is a waste of money.",1.0

I originally purchased this manual to see how to remove the fascia and chrome for a Road King so that I can fix the steering dampener grommets. The book does not even mention it. Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get.

"I am a classic DIY'er who enjoys working on all manner of projects, including minor automotive repairs. So, I bought this manual, having used both Haynes and Chilton in the past. I have a 2001 Nissan Frontier and wanted to change the spark plugs, wires, cap, and rotor. I read online that the sixth plug is difficult to reach and replace. The online suggestions seemed a little odd, so I thought this manual might help. Wrong! After changing the cap and rotor, first five plugs and wires within twenty-five minutes, the sixth plug took over five hours to reach. The manual had no help at all. I had to use a telescoping mirror just to see the cylinder hole in which to place the plug and then the plug wouldn't thread correctly. I ended up having to take the truck to a mechanic who told the only way to reach the plug was remove the intake. Others suggested that I loosen the engine mounts and tilt the motor forward two inches. Either way, no mention on any difficulties with this plug in the manual. It says it is based on a complete tear down and rebuild. This is a joke. The author didn't once attempt this project on the 2001 model or its instructions would have been far more detailed than something like,",1.0
I have a 1999 Nissan Pick-Up with a diesel engine. The manual only covers gasoline models but the title gives no hint to this.,1.0
"Manual seems very cheap. The book is very generic to most common problems. The electrical diagrams are helpful for diagnosing. As far as troubleshooting most mechanical problems, this manual won't help.",1.0
Manual not as informative as prior books I bought for other vehicles.  Hayes tries to cover to many years resulting in limited details on specific model/year.  In my opinion not worth buying.  More and better information on Internet.,1.0

"I purchased this manual to do a head gasket replacement on my 1999 Wrangler. Haynes was always the resource for serious mechanics many years ago but that has obviously changed. Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters. My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor, rotor, wires and plugs. According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been. After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good. How can you publish a manual with a major error like that?",1.0
"Don't bother. I bought this to change the wheel bearings in my wife's car, it says because of the tools required, take it to a professional. What's the point of getting the manual if it's just going to say take it to a professional. Save yourself 20$ and just look it up on YouTube",1.0

"I wasted a good deal of time following the instructions to remove and replace the starter motor on my 2000 Mazda 626 4-cylinder.  What the authors chose not to mention was that the starter in the Mazda 626 is not in the same place as in the example car (Ford Probe), so the Mazda starter cannot be removed and replaced by following the instructions.  I removed the entire air intake housing, as instructed, before I figured out that there's no way in hell you can get to the starter from that direction.  Ingenious!

Maybe this manual is useful for the Ford Probe or MX-6, but it is useless if you want to fix your Mazda 626.  I really want to find the publishing executive responsible for this nonsense and throw my old starter through his windshield.  Until then, I'll just try to find a manual that is specifically written for my Mazda.",1.0

Too many things are generalized and don't relate to the specific model.

"How to find  and get to the spare tire is information that a driver needs to know. That info is not in this book. After decades, a  major change to these vans is Stow-n-Go seats that fold into the floor. With  the Stow-n-go seats taking up space under the car, Chrysler engineers moved the spare tire from its usual pickup-truck-like position under the rear of the car to under the car between the driver and front passenger seats. You need a special tool from the car's jacking  kit to access the winch inside the car from between the front seats and lower the spare tire from under the car.
  In this book, you will have to really search for the two half photographs of  the spare tire and the three sentence blurb of a paragraph that basically says ""lower spare tire , install on car.""
  I gained more info from online videos on the subject after I had already spent $24 on this book.

"The item shown IN THE PICTURE is the original, classic Barrel of Monkeys. I ordered three of them ($21 worth) to use as a prop in an upcoming leadership workshop.

But what they sent me is completely unusable, as it is not what I need. So now I have to take time and effort out of my busy day to return these for a refund. There's no excuse for any vendor on Amazon (or anywhere online) to show a picture of an item that's different from the actual product they're shipping. That is called deception. Perhaps the intention was innocent, but they're just setting a customer up for disappointment and annoyance. This may seem like a stupid and trivial complaint.

"Coleman Cable 08662 25-Feet Heavy-Duty Booster Cables, 4-Gauge.  I bought the ""best"" January 2013 and just stored them in the trunk for some future emergency.  Had a totally dead battery in Hyundai 6 months later (dome light left on), and pulled up 2nd car (Expedition).  Once hooked up, all power was restored to Hyundai dashboard lights, horn, windows, etc.  But on turning the key to start, all voltage disappeared and starter didn't even click.  Worked half an hour getting a firmer clamp on top post terminals, letting the Expedition run at 1500 RPM to charge up the Hyundai battery a little... all with no success.  There was so much resistance in the Coleman cables that once real amperage attempted to flow, there was a complete voltage drop across the cables.  A friend loaned me a ratty old pair of cheap cables that started the car instantaneously.  Were the Colemans really 4 gauge?  Or perhaps manufacturing defect where cable welded to clamp.  They were completely useless.  Tried to return but Amazon web site said they had to be returned in 30 days... but, hurray for Amazon.com, when I explained the problem by e-mail that upon first use, they failed, Amazon approved the return 6 months after purchase.  Its not obvious how to test jumper cables when first purchased and you don't have a dead battery to try out the cables.  I will buy a different brand from Amazon.com.

I need the jumper cables for emergency use only so they hopefully won't be used much.  If you need to unroll and roll up the cables often look for copper cable, not this product.

"6 years = 3 motors.

I had the misfortune of having a Lomanco fan installed with my new house.  Of course to work best it is in the highest, hottest, most difficult to access portion of the roof.  Well, I am now and expert a changing out the Lomanco fan motors since they fail (seize up) approximately every 2 years.  House if 6 years old and I just replaced my third motor.

Bad enough but what torques me even a little more is these units are remote and hard to get to.  So, you don't even know when they fail.  For all I know, the motor failed months ago and I have been burning up my shingles and AC units to deal with the high attic temps.  I someone offered a heavy duty motor = it would be worth the $15 bucks to be able to rely on the attic fan working.

So, I am planning on converting this Piece of Stuff to use a gable fan which I'll mount flush below the roof board but use the existing roof hole, critter screen, and roof cap.  Hopefully Broan makes better motors.

If you are going to stick with your Lomanco motors, buy six motors and store them near your attic fan.  You change them out just about as frequently as the oil in your lawn tractor.",1.0
"My new Motor lasted all but 6 months. In the Northeast! I replaced it yesterday (91 deg. F - OUTSIDE). My thinking is as follows: When I went to turn the Fan Blade - it was slightly siezed - & then it spun freely. But it still had burned out a a result of the light siezed condition. If you can easily get to your fan, as I can, turn the Thermostat to turn on at the highest Temp. - once Fall has passed. Or, install a switch, so that the Unit will not try to turn on during the next Season, unless you're there. I plan to freshly lube mine in the Spring - and TURN IT BY HAND for the 1st 'power - up' of the season. I hope this will ease any high current draw should things sieze over the cold winter months again. One other thing... installing an in-line Fuse may save the windings as well. My old Motor was similar - but it was over 20 yrs old & I never did ANYTHING to it. My roofer tossed it in the Dumpster w/o even asking me. I certainly should've saved that motor!

I bought this item 27 April 2012 and here it is May 29 2012 and motor quit. But the company acted fast to my problem. They sent me a new one at no cost and no hassle. The company takes pride in their USA made products. So I would recomend ordering attic fan motors from this company.,1.0

I removed the motor from inside the attic, it wasn't fun but I got it out and was surprised at the small size and lightness in weight of the motor.

I could have replaced it with the same but went to Home Depot and they had one type of replacement motor on the shelf.  In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference.  The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.

The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced.  Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design.  I am not sure of the Lomanco model having these features but I am guessing it doesn't.  Regardless, the Lomanco model died in just a few years and quality motors typically last 20 years.",1.0

"This product being advertised as a 'muffler' is misleading. I observed no difference in sound level.  I just completed my test.  It is being returned.  An effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac.

"I didn't need exhaust dispersion.  If I did I would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device (To my knowledge none exist).  I wanted a muffler.  This doesn't muffle. I took it back.  The End

PS This site won't allow my 'zero star' rating.",1.0
"I was surprised to see that this 'muffler' received 4 stars. When I read the reviews, praise was given not because it muffles sound, but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust. Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)

When we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.

It is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on. So in terms of living up to its name, I give it one star.",1.0
"This is definitely not a noise muffler. It's not a silencer either. It does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face. By redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable. I bought this for our new Ridgid WD1680, which Amazon doesn't sell. The big box store I bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so I got this to go with it. Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it. The WD1680 also works as a removeable blower. In that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port, even though it was the same port with just a tube attachment. So bottom line is that this is useless.",1.0

First off this thing is pretty nice and comes with great accessories BUT half the reason I bought this was because it's innovative and sleek design compared to the basic cylinder shape most heat guns have. I received a more basic one that says HT1100 as well. So I'm not sure if it's a deceiving picture or what but they definitely sent me a different one. All the accessories match the ones in the pictures. Overall I'm pretty happy and will keep it regardless because returning stuff online is a pain. Have pictures but can't upload them.,1.0
"This device is packaged as a paint removing tool on the box, so I expected it to work at least middling-well. It did not.

Our bathroom was painted in latex over oil without a primer before we moved in, so we need to remove it to start fresh since it currently peels off.

"While draining the oil from the drain pan, the yellow lid popped off and dumped half of the oil on me!

Save yourself a lot of hassle and buy a higher rated product.",1.0
"Ten or fifteen years ago someone made a design similar to this.  But it was good quality, heavy plastic, had asymmetric threads on the caps so they'd pull down properly, had o-ring seals on both large and small caps, and high-quality plastic materials that didn't swell with oil exposure and lose their fit.

The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all.

"I bought this item a couple days ago so I could change the oil in my truck. I bought it at a Walmart at RI because oil is pretty cheap there and my oil pan was back in CT. Overall the construction was nice, the removable filter on top was nice and the size was perfect and even the opening was perfect. But the Goddamned cap on the side for drainage leaks A LOT!

I changed the oil in one truck, put the pan in the back of my other truck overnight and came out to a good half quart leaked out.  I thought maybe I didn't tighten the cap down enough so I gave it another quarter turn and the next day was more of the same.  As much as I liked the concept, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.",1.0

It leaks all over the place no matter what you do and the cap for the large orifice does not seal at all, creating a large oil spill in your new garage and ruining your clothes.  This is the absolute worst $10 I have ever spent.",1.0
"This product leaks so badly that I might as well have taken ten bucks out of my pocket, set it on the floor of my garage and drained my cars oil right on top of it. Oh, wait then I would still have the ten oily bucks.

"I bought one of these to change the oil on my RV.  It seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately, this is NOT a quality product.  Once I had drained the oil, I put the large lid (on the side of the pan) back on and picket the drain pan up.  In the process, the large lid simply popped off the drain pan, dumping about 2 quarts of dirty engine oil all over the garage floor.  Even if the lid doesn't come off, it leaks badly with large amounts of oil running down the side of the oil pan.  AVOID this product at all costs! It will cause more grief than good.

I'll just echo the other reviews on this product.  Both caps leak and it leaves a huge mess on your garage floor.,1.0
I've have two of these and trust me its not about IF the cap will leak but WHEN.  The cap is made from plastic that gets brittle when it comes in contact with oil!! Why Rhino will not change this easy to fix solution is beyond me. Even the large main cap on the top does not close securely enough to carry the container on its side without oil leaking out.  Do NOT buy this.,1.0

"Bought for oil changes and whatnot.  Mine actually worked decent most of the time.  It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said.  My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split.  Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it.  Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website.  I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail.  I thought that was nice of them.  Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out.  Would not recommend this product.",1.0

"This drain pan is totally useless.  The concept is good, but they have used the cheapest materials available for construction.  I would gladly pay double what they're asking if it would work as designed.  First of all, the drain cap broke during my first use after it failed to stop a continuous leaking of oil from the side.  The top cap also broke during my second usage and I had to resort to using a large garbage bag to transport both the leaking oil (making a major mess in the process) and pan to the recycle place.  After dumping the remaining oil, I just threw out this piece of trash and swore to never buy anything from Blitz again.  This item is supposed to make your oil change easier, but instead, it made it much more messy than necessary and cumbersome to clean up.",1.0
"When I first bought this oil pan/container, I thought it was pretty neat, because it has a screen and a large twist cap that allows the container to be stood up after changing the oil.  Well, after three oil changes, I have thrown it out.  The small twist-off cap cracked and broke, and the large twist-off cap leaks when stood up.  If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport.  I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small.  I made a mess when I used it, as the position needed to be adjusted - and forget about trying to line up this pan with the oil filter.",1.0

"This product suffers from the same thing every other oil change product does - leaks.

I purchased this from AutoZone and was skeptical.  The rep told me ahead of time that it will eventually leak, just not as bad as the others.  The problems are:

* The top lid can be easily overtightened causing the top large lid to leak.
* The small side cap can be easily cracked just by tightening rendering the pan useless.

It took 3 oil changes for me and this is in the trash.  Back to the cheapo metal pans.

Just to add.. the AutoZone rep was brutally honest and I appreciate that, great store, just a bad product with no good inexpensive ones on the market.",1.0
"This item is poorly made. Even with the cap well put, IT LEAKS! Oil all over my trunk and garage.",1.0
"I bought this product hoping to help with oil changes on my truck & SUV. The wide mouth and screen make the distance the oil drops to the drain pan less of a mess from splatter.  However the durability and execution of this product is questionable.  I am on the second one of these as the cap cracked on the first oil change for the initial pan.  The auto parts store exchanged the pan for a new with no questions.  The second one has lasted through 3-4 oil changes but the side cap leaks (and top cap for that matter) and I wouldn't use this container to transport the used oil without fear of it leaking in my trunk.  Blitz needs to improve their execution of this product before I'll buy another or recommend to a friend.  On a separate note, my Wedco drain pan has lasted 15 years with many successfull oil changes.",1.0
"I have pwned this oil pan for 6 years and I can testify that it leaks from both the end cap when horizontal and the top as you pour.  They are not major leaks, but the leak around the top is sufficient to make a mess when you pour, and the leak around the small plug is enough to allow residual oil in the pan to ooze out after the pan sits for a while.  The opening is also small, such that (at least on my cars) for the first minute or two after the drain plug is removed it cannot catch both the oil stream and the drips from drain port.  This leads to a rather large oil pool under my car.  I came to Amazon to finally find a new one and had to comment after seeing this here.",1.0
"i picked this up from walmart - and it was really cheap. $7-$8. after using it on an oil change, i thought it was a good product because of the design.  but the larger diameter screw cap as well as the smaller drain cap both leak oil. i screwed them on tightly but the oil still seeps out. i found out the hard way as it leaked all inside my car, even after i double bagged it. that makes this product pretty much useless",1.0
"Just like the others said, mine leaked, couldn't stop it which led to a frantic dumping into a 5 gallon bucket.  What a waste of my bucket and my patience as I deal with cleaning up my garage floor.  Total junk.",1.0
I bought this at a local Auto Zone. I went to tighten the smaller drain cap and it cracked. I exchanged it for another and that leaks oil despite the cap not breaking on this one. I left it in a garbage bag and it's half full of oil. How can stores and this company market and sell something like this that obviously does not work? Frustrating to say the least!,1.0
Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it.  Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it.  I bought to save myself time in the clean up.  I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.,1.0
"What an absolute piece of garbage. You won't be thinking about the money you wasted on this thing as hot oil comes splashing over the ""chicken wire"" mesh that sits under the large cover. Yes, the ""chicken wire"" can be removed, perhaps by just touching it and then the whole thing falls into the hot oil, but then you have a large area to drop the drain plug into, The side spout leaks and if you try to tighten it too much, it will pop back out, ditto for the top lid. Oh, by the way the top lid leaks a little bit, too, but if you're taking this thing full of oil somewhere, you better put it into a leakproof container....inside of another leakproof container - and maybe the place will throw the whole piece of junk out for you.

I made a total mess the first time I used this, will get the oil drained and then the whole thing's going into the garbage and I'll look for a better design.",1.0
I purchased this container and it leaks like crazy. It does not matter how tight you tighten the cap on the side. It works its way loose and starts leaking. Also there is a screen on the top below the top lid. It easily falls through the top hole and winds up in the oil.,1.0
"It's a great idea...  But, the big lid on top is difficult to get screwed on correctly with getting it cock-eyed or cross threaded.  And even when you do have it on right, it doesn't seal up very well and allows some oil to leak.",1.0
"This product is horrible.  Nothing about it works correctly.  I purchased this at an auto parts store without doing any research online.  I guess the only good thing about it is that I'm not out more than $10 so assume this is why it has a one star rating.

First of all the opening is too small and the drain plug catch screen causes oil to splatter.  You will be repositioning this thing from start to finish trying to catch the draining oil.  Once finished you will be cleaning oil off your floor and this drain pan.

If you seal it up it will constantly leak oil.  I assumed oil wouldn't leak out of the top if it is laying flat, but somehow any oil on top of the seal will find its way out.  You would need to clean any and all oil from the large opening screen area.  Then you will find that the large cap will not screw on correctly.  You wipe the outside clean and a minute later there is more oil leaking out.

Next is the small drain plug.  This thing cannot be tightened.  Like the large cap if you tighten it too much it pops out of the threads, too little and it will not be sealed.  Either way it leaks.  It took me a few days between changing the oil and dumping it at the recycling drum.  Each day I would wipe up the oil from underneath and from the drain pan itself.  Each time had as much or more oil than last.  When I finally took the used oil to the store I dumped this piece of crap in the trash and bought a basic large open pan for $3.

Buy this oil drain pan if you want to witness a product so flawed that it does nothing right for what should be a simple task.",1.0

"I've owned two or three of these by now and unfortunately it's about the only type/brand of oil pan sold anywhere near me.  Do not buy this piece of junk, the top lid doesn't screw on tight and the front drain cap leaks.

"I bought this and used it exactly one time.  After oil leaked from both caps all over my floor, I threw it away and started over.  Do not buy this.",1.0
"I needed a pan so I bought this at my local auto parts store, took it home and had problems with the lid so I figured it was defective and took it back to exchange it but it had similar problems.

Although I've never had a problem with the small cap, the top lid is a joke at best. It's either loose or semi-screwed on. In either state you will lose a lot of oil. The 2 times I risked taking it to the oil depository I had it on top of old carpet, etc. in the trunk to absorb the oil that might spill.

It has a screen under the lid part which is ridiculous. It actually splashes falling oil onto you and other things. Not only that but mine has fallen inside of the container.

I can't believe so many stores and chains still sell this item after what must be thousands of dissatisfied, and oily, customers.",1.0
"Cap on top does not seal, therefore oil will not stay in the container, making it pretty much worthless.",1.0

As a result, there is no way to store this without leaking out of either the lid on the side or the top.  I wish they would make a decent quality product and just charge a bit more for it.

[...]",1.0
"The opening is too small for automotive use and neither lid seals. Due to the distance between the typical oil pan drain plug and the oil drain pan, the draining oil can easily spill onto the floor and sides of the oil drain pan. The small size also prevents draining the oil pan and changing the oil filter simultaneously. After use, the large lid and drain plug both leaked. I used this product once, returned the oil to a local auto parts chain, and threw the empty oil drain pan in the trash on the way out!",1.0
"I bought this product to prevent oil spills. Conceptually it is sound. Practically, not so much. once it fills with oil, the oil leaks out of the smaller front lid sending oil on to the floor. No matter how you twist the smaller cap it will not make a seal. I am returning this product for a refund. Terrible. In addition, the larger top lid is no better. I bought this from a brick store and compared it to others of the same product, and they all have very poor quality (none of them made proper lid seals). Save yourself a headache and disappointment. Do not buy this product.",1.0
"The oil drain pain in the picture on this product page clearly shows a pour spout.  The ones that are being shipped do not have a spout like this, they just have a small section of the rim that is pushed out.  This is essentially useless as a pour spout and the oil just flows over the rim and onto your garage floor/driveway.",1.0
"Why would anyone make an oil drain pan with a spout that is flush with the top rim?  That's not a spout.  Unless you pour the oil out of this thing at a ridiculously slow rate, the oil just flows over the sides and misses whatever you are trying to pour the oil into.

This thing is going straight into the trash.",1.0
this item is flimsy when filled with 5 quarts of oil. pouring the oil out is a challenge. recomend getting a different kind,1.0
I bought a similar Blitz 10 quart oil drain container at Autozone and have had the same problems as other reviewers. The product looked like a great idea as it had a screen on the opening to rest the filter and prevent the crush washer or drain plug from accidentally falling in. I was shocked to find that the side cap leaks. I actually thought the people at Autozone were at fault and had placed the wrong cap on the product. I went back in the store to try to return it and the clerk showed me that all of the caps were exactly the same. Apparently the cap only screws on over half of the threads on the container! This is one of the most poorly designed products I have ever bought. I mean the whole purpose of the product is to keep the oil in the container without it leaking all over the place until it can be recycled. I have never written a complaint like this before but I felt compelled to do so because of problems with this product. I did submit a complaint on the company via their website and also requested a replacement cap. I will update this review after hearing from the company.,1.0
"This is a great design but executed very poorly.  The concept of a large opening up top and grille to catch the drain plug in the oil pan is smart.  The side spout to drain oil is also well thought out.

BUT...the side spout cap is made of extremely weak plastic.  As others have said, it leaks.  Actually, the threads on mine broke during my 2nd time using it in only 4 months of ownership.  I did not tighten it excessively.  The thickness of the top of the cap is maybe 1/16-1/8 of in inch so it is prone to just break.

You will be better off buying a large flat aluminum cooking pot in a resale shop or garage sale because it will last forever and not 4 months like this product.",1.0
"This is a great concept.  It has a handy screen to catch your drain plug and crush washer, and looks like you could just haul it to your local auto parts store for recycling once you finish draining the crankcase. NOT! Once you get past draining a little over 3 quarts the used oil level gets even with the pour spout (small cap) and starts to leak even with the cap screwed on tightly.  This is because there are no gaskets in either the spout cap or the large top cap.

Further, there aren't enough plastic threads in either cap to prevent leakage.  So, if you're draining a typical 4-quart crankcase, you have to prop this thing up at an angle to avoid the spout leakage, and then transfer it into an actual leak proof container (gallon plastic water bottle?) ASAP to keep used oil from assaulting your garage floor.  Whew, c'mon Blitz, we think you coulda' thought this through a little better.  You make some good products...this just ain't one of them.",1.0
"wow... where to begin.

As mentioned in the other reviews, this LEAKS... which is not what you want when dealing with 5+ quarts of oil... it's a PITA to clean up afterwards.

Draining this is stupid too.. MOST oil pans are TAPERED so that when you drain it the oil goes down a little channel so MOST if not all of the oil is gone... not this.  It's just a hole that is in the side (topped with a screw cap that does NOT stay tight and also leaks)  So you are forced to move the entire container around to get that extra half cup of oil OUT of the pan and then what happens is you get dripps and leaks from the top center larger portion of the lid...

this is absolute garbage... I can't understand who thought this was a great idea to make but obviously they failed as engineers making this thing...",1.0

"Sorry folks - MAJOR complaint: purchased the 6 qt. oil drain at a leading national auto parts retailer yesterday...

... I honestly cannot recall purchasing a product so stunningly inferior - no matter how hard I tried to seal the oil, both the large top screw cap as well as the smaller side one leaked. What a mess.

Had to pack the container in several plastic bags, took it back to Advance this morning to recycle the oil. Walked to the rear of the store... to the room that contained the large oil tank - imagine my surprise in seeing two empty, oily Blitz 6 qt. containers, oily bags next to them, discarded and sitting on the top of the tank. Hello!? Two add'l customers obviously felt as I did... screw this container, I'm never using it again. What a piece of junk. My discarded one made three.

One might say ""Buddy, what do you want for this price?"".  NO. Wrong. I'd gladly pay double and more for a quality, leak-proof container I could conveniently use over and over again.

Perhaps what amazes me the most: I'd somehow expect this from a China/Taiwan-made product... but American???!!!!

Additionally: It took less than a minute on Google to find a corroborating negative review from a disappointed Blitz customer.

""Blitz: The Seven Organic Principles?... Identity, Openness, Connectedness, Balance, Creativity, Flexibility, and Wholeness??""... HUH!!!???.... YO, HOW 'BOUT ""QUALITY?""....

...""At Blitz, we have a firm understanding of our identity as a provider of quality consumer products from the Garage to the Garden."" Please. Don't make me laugh.

In summary: Complete waste of money and effort. Recycling oil is supposed to save our environment... instead, there's one more used plastic oil drain container in a landfill. Blitz: you should be ashamed selling such an inferior product -  and shame on any auto parts store for carrying it.",1.0
"the idea of a large drain opening with cap covering entire drain opening is great, but when the product is tipped over, oil leaks out the large drain cap, and also starting with during the draining process, oil leaks out of the cheap little side drain cap (the drain cap easily is overtightend - never makes a good seal).  the world needs a high quality version of this desgin.",1.0
"If you don't mind spilling half or more of your used oil on the garage floor, this product is the one for you!

I wasted more time talking to the manufacturer who simply said it wouldn't work, but didn't want to do anything to correct the problem.

"The size is great. The volume and pressure each pump stroke produces is best I've seen. Materials are mostly quite solid. BUT THE CAN ITSELF SLOWLY SEEPS THE CONTENTS FROM MULTIPLE SEAMS. This was true of the first one I received as well as the replacement I was sent.

"Oh, she's a leaker as other's have stated. Not understanding why the manufacturer can't get this simple oiler right without any leaks.
I did get rid of the stock bronze gasket and put a rubber gasket but the leak comes from the crimp at the bottom of the nozzle where it attaches to the lid on top. I also used GOOP but it still leaks although not as much. I'd never buy again. It makes a mess wherever you store it.",1.0
"Terrible product, leaks from multiple places, made a mess in my tool box",1.0

"Leaks like a sieve.  The pump is decent, but if there is no oil in the can because it has leaked everywhere and caused a huge mess, it's not much use.

This seems to be a systemic issue due to the bottom being crimped on rather than welded.  It's nearly a guarantee that the one you will buy will have the same problem.  I can't figure out why they haven't addressed this.

If you look at the picture, there is a ring of oil around the bottom.  This is after leaving it there a day or so.  If I had known it was going to do leak like this, I never would have bought it.  Really disappointed in the DL company and name after this experience.",1.0

This can does not perform well.  I blend a mixture of 60 vis nap oil and acetone for a penetrating oil formula.  The fluid leaks out of the cork washer at the flexible hose fitting.  Makes a mess.  The pump works very well.  The rigid hose works much better.,1.0
"Edit: or more of an update. He's really sick of this thing. It apparently leaks all the time. The entire neck leaks. It's made a horrible mess. He's waited long enough that we're not going to return it, but we may make a difference for potential buyer by dissuading that person from wasting money on an unsatisfactory product.

Original review that had 4 stars:
I bought this for my husband. He really likes having one, but here are 2 things he says you need to know before you buy this:

1 - it leaks around the base of the applicator tip. It's not on right or something he says. When he presses down on the thumb trigger thing, oil comes out where it's supposed to, but it also comes out just behind the tip, too. It's permanently affixed there, so you can't tighten it.

2 - it leaks around the base of the tube, too. He thinks he may not have it screwed on tight enough, so we'll see now that he's tightened it down.

Would he recommend it? Maybe or maybe not, depending on whether you could find a better one. He likes the size but wishes it didn't leak.

Oh, and he keeps 30 weight oil in it, in case you need to know. I don't know what that means, but you should if you are looking for an oil can.",1.0
bought this dispite the reviews that said it leaks....wish i hadnt...now i have to leave it sitting on a small metal saucer to catch the oil that leaks from the bottom :(,1.0
this thing leaks down after use and makes a mess all over,1.0
"when you tip this can, it leaks around the bar that goes up and down.  Oil everywhere",1.0
"Have had this for years and it continually leaked where flexible tube is fastened and then oil runs down the side of canister and soils whatever it sits on.  Tried to tighten, but no help.  Lastly the flex tube falls off.  I need to buy another and will avoid this brand.",1.0

"Worked great when I first got it but over the months the trigger developed a stiffness and would stay in actuated position longer and longer then last week it completely stopped pumping, nothing at all came out. PS. I was using it with a WD-40 type solution called powerlube. I wish I could get my $$$ back and invest in a better made product. If you find one let me know.",1.0
"I bought this oiler, along with several other ""Goldenrod"" oilers... I thought they would be high quality because they were made in usa.... I was wrong.

This particular oiler was filled with WD-40 and after a few days of use, it started developing multiple leaks (at the base/seam , lid and spout base.

For the purpose of this review, I mixed UV dye in the oilier with my WD-40, then took pictures using a UV light.  It clearly shows the problem areas.

If you are looking for a oil can that gets your hands oily with each use and always leaves a puddle of oil on your workstation, then you have found a match! Look no further.",1.0
The worst amazon purchased I've ever made. It leaked the first day I put tapping fluid in there. I tried fixing it with Teflon tape but that doesn't even work.,1.0
Leaks profusely from day one. Added ATF and acetone mix and it leaks from the bottom of the can and from the top. The top does not screw on tightly. I bought this because it seemed high quality and because it was made in USA. It just leaks everywhere.,1.0
"Poor seal, oil leaks no matter what you do.",1.0
This is not of quality. The very first use on my milling machine ball oilers the flexible spout leaked at the base where they glue it on. The thumb lever for the pump is easily bent if you apply any pressure to pump oil into an oil cavity. Waste of money. If they can fix the leaky spout and toughen up the pump lever it would be acceptable.,1.0
"I was bought this as a present. After spending some time getting it calibrated it worked for about a week, then went off the rails. Now, the odd times when it does actually display something, it doesn't provide any kind of useful information, with the direction displayed being completely inaccurate. DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT!",1.0
"ADVICE: DON'T buy this thing!
I bought this thing hoping that it would really ""navigate"". It is definitely disappoining. I followed the instructions on the manual and calibrated it. It eventually got the right direction after several frustating calibration. The second day, it was totally off (indicating ""N"" while I was traving south). And now I just cannot get it work -- it is displaying ""E"" no matter where you are heanding, and no matter how you calibrate it.",1.0
"Minor changes in the temparature of your windshield are enough to send the compass flying off, usually while driving.  Additionally, it needs to be mounted at least 5 inches from a speaker or it won't work, which in my vehicle is nearly impossible.  Nice idea but not worth the effort...",1.0

"This was the first of three different PNI compass models I have bought through Amazon, and I would not recommend any of them.  If they worked right, I would love them.  But all three of them will not stay on.  It says they will stay on unless no change in the magnetic direction is for ten minutes.  This simply is not true as all three of mine that I have bought shut off all the time, even if I just drive around the block all day.",1.0
"piece of crap, 3 rivets then done. 4th stuck in the barrel.

Wish I could leave ZERO STARS.",1.0
"I bought 2 packs of rivets both of which were fewer than expected.  One was short 5 rivets the other short 3.  What's the point of labeling it when it comes up short consistently?  Also, when using them, the centers snapped at different points.  Quite disappointing that they don't all snap as expected within the base.  Aesthetically it looks bad due to the lack of consistency when some have a hollow base while others are still filled with the shaft.  After reading the label closely Arrow rivets aren't designed to be used with their own tool!  ""Not for use with manually operated rivet tools""",1.0
Rivets are too long for most projects. Need more variety in a pack like this. I should have shopped locally at Home Depot to see what I was getting.,1.0
I thought these were a bigger sizes kit I can't  use them I did not see a bigger sized rivet kit through this company I'm not suer y they do not have ? The product arrived on time and looks like a good kit just to small for what I need. I really can't afford to send them back end of this project. That what I get for not knowing Pop rivets sizes.,1.0
"One of the worst tools I've ever owned. It jammed after about a dozen rivets. No way to clear it. Totally frustrating when you are in the middle of a project. The quality is so poor that I will do anything I can to avoid Arrow in the future. Luckily, the Arrow staple gun I already own has yet to fail. Maybe they should stick to staples!",1.0
"I've used this riveter a grand total of four times, it no longer works.  The jaws will no longer retract the rivet stem, I'm only using soft aluminum rivets so I can't understand why this riveter has failed, but it has.  I've disassembled it to try and fix it, there is no fixing it.",1.0
"Do not waste your money. This tool is beyond useless. I was able to successfully install one rivet and then a stuck mandrel.
Unless you have Paul Bunyon size hands, it is nearly impossible to work the handles they are so far apart. I took it apart and
was able to install one more and then it self destructed again. You got me once, Arrow but you won't get me a again ever!",1.0
"It broke after 15 rivets.  The ""manual"" online is nothing but a 101 guide to pop rivets.  I could not find a manual that explained troubleshooting procedure or disassembly.  I can live with a product having a problem, but I can not live with a company that provides no help..",1.0
"I got this gift card from a friend, and it was the best! The site has so much to choose from... great gift.",5.0
"aren't we going to save trees?! :) People who were complaining about paper gift cards can simply buy an electronic gift card via email. It's very convenient and indeed a great gift. I found paper gift cards annoying since you have to always wonder how much money you got left on it. And if you lose it, you lose it. An electronic delivery of the gift card makes it a lot of easier to redeem, you only need to COPY/PASTE the code into your gift certificate balance and it'll be there whenever you want to use it.

I've sent friends electronic gift cards via email for their newborns, for their weddings, and for their housewarmings. :)

Happy holidays",5.0

We I got some 50 dollar gift cards to buy parts to upgrade my old laptop computer at Goody's. The gift cards are fine and you do not have to pay a fee like Visa gift card or master card. But they were not reloadable but are good and safe for small purchases under 500 dollars. And unlike credit cards there is no interest to pay just the amount of the card upfront at point of purchase. So for my experience was good. After these I never want a credit or prepaid debit card for shopping on Amazon.,5.0

"I purchased a gift card from Amazon for the first time to give to my brother, who lives in a different state than I, for his birthday.  I love gift cards and give them for wedding gifts, etc. but never have purchased one from Amazon before.  It arrived very quickly, which was wonderful since I had to mail it on before his birthday.  It turned out to be the perfect gift.  My brother had seen something at Amazon he wanted to buy but didn't have the whole amount in his budget.  My gift enabled him to get what he wanted as a ""birthday present"" to himself (kind of).  Thanks for making these available and, as always, for the quick delivery.",5.0

"With children, adolescents, teens, and adults for whom I must shop for birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays, my poor brain gets overloaded with ideas and suggestions.  Then, because we do not all live near one another or get to see on another regularly, I do not always have an idea of what they prefer. BUT. . .I found a sure cure way to please them all and get marvelous thank you notes!

I am willing to share with you.  I send Amazon gift cards!!!!!

For those I like a lot, I send a more expensive card, for those I am just remembering, I send a less expensive one.  No matter, I know that my family and friends can go to Amazon.com and find something that they will really want and with which they will be pleased.

I have had thank you notes for such varied things as towels, sheet music, transformers (that is a toy, I learned), and books.  Not for a moment would I have thought of these gifts and yet they were gratefully received.

AND, your ordering them is as easy as clicking your cursor on one of the links below, entering the information such as to whom it is to go, for how much, and your credit card information.  BUT. . .the GREATEST thing is, if you forget and you are driving to work and remember your mother's birthday is TODAY (YIKES!), you can go to the link and have the card delivered to her computer THAT DAY!!!!!! She can shop for her gift before you get home from work!  Now, you cannot beat that.

So, I highly recommend an Amazon.com gift card to solve your shopping woes.

"I'm terrible trying to guess what my nieces, nephews, cousins and other relatives want for Christmas. I also dislike sending money even if the bills are fresh, crisp and in a nice bank envelope. But everyone likes money and Amazon sells everything, so why NOT buy anyone an Amazon Gift Certificate? You can send one for any amount by E-mail or print one at home and include it in a nice card or (my favorite), buy a Gift Card made out to the relative and send it to myself, where I can include it in a nice Holiday card. This is the perfect gift!

On an aside, you know how tough banks are about credit cards lately. If you don't use your card in a month or usually a year, your card can be cancelled or the credit limit will be reduced (I have had this happen). So I took my cards with zero balances and bought myself $5 worth of gift certificates made out to myself. Now it shows the banks that I am using my valuable cards and all I have to do is pay off that $5 the next time the bill comes around. I know that most brokers and banks well raise an eyebrow at this, but these are weird times and I will do anything to keep my credit score high. Plus, I get to get a cool gift for myself. PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE IMMEDIATELY! Have fun shopping!

I will be very happy to buy anything from Amazon...you are amazing!",5.0
Such a great teachers gift.  They can purchase just about ANYTHING they want all from the comfort of their own homes.,5.0
"I *highly* recommend the electronic versions of the Amazon gift cards as well as the ones you can print on your own. I have never had a problem with either of these methods, nor have any of my card recipients.

Although it is theoretically better etiquette to give a physical card, I've found that because Amazon is an online vendor and the cardholder is going to visit the web to use the card number, recipients enjoy the convenience of having the card information delivered to their inboxes--especially when it's on the day of a special event. If you use the printed versions, you can easily mail or hand deliver your gift with your personalization applied.

In short, make your life easier by sending joy to your loved ones through the technological magic of your computer--they truly will appreciate the sentiment behind your gift regardless of the delivery method.",5.0

When I made the next purchase, several days later, I had the option to use my gift card balance instead of a credit card. It was easy and straight forward, and I was able to purchase what I wanted.
I also gave an email gift certificate to a friend. She received it right away. It didn't even wind up in the spam folder, like I was afraid it might.
Both experiences were just as I hoped and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.",5.0

I purchased 2 Amazon gift cards.  This is the way to go.  They were mailed in plenty of time for giving and the recipients loved them.  They can pick out their own gifts and make sure they get what they want.  There are thousands of choices on Amazon and they will have no problem finding something to choose.,5.0

"I, too, bought a couple of Amazon gift cards for Christmas gifts and the recipients were thrilled. The difference was that i bought them from a gift card kiosk at a local grocery store. The store personnel activated them in front of me so there were no glitches or shipping delays/charges. I just lucked out - it never would have occurred to me to check reviews on gift cards from Amazon. I just stopped to look at the gift card display in the store and was pleasantly surprised to find Amazon cards as one of the choices. It's ironic that the whole joy of the Amazon shipping experience for me is the online ease and fast, efficient delivery and that's the very thing that caused so much frustration for so many people this holiday. Now, I'm inclined to wonder about some of their electronic systems. I hope they work out their problems..",5.0

"Amazon,
I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says ""Merry Christmas"" or mentions Christmas at all!  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a card that reflects the actual ""holiday"" we are celebrating. On principle, I cannot send a Amazon gift card this Christmas.  What's up with all the Political Correctness?  Bad marketing decision.

"Why take 50 dollars of good money with no limitations, and turn it into Amazon money that can only be used at their site? Where is the benefit?

Also, you spend time and headache buying these types of cards, dealing with any activation issues risking expiration or delivery issues and then you have to keep up with them and keep track of how much you have remaining on the card....

They should at least give a discount for committing your purchasing power to them...",1.0

""Thank you for contacting us at Amazon.com. I'm sorry to hear that the gift card envelopes were damaged when opening it. I do understand your concern in this regard.

I got a $50 gift card as a gift from someone else. When I opened the card from the cardboard holder I discovered that the claim code was not fully readable.

"I purchased six $50 Amazon Gift Cards from a local supermarket (Bi Lo) to give as Christmas Gifts in 2015 (something I've done for many years). My Sister-in-law, the recipient of one of those $50 Amazon Gift Cards called me to say that she's lost the Gift Card (most likely accidentally discarded with all of the Christmas paper, etc. and burned in the trash). I told her ""no problem"", since I had kept my receipt from Bi Lo that includes the Amazon Gift Card Number, and I felt certain that Amazon would be able to see that no purchases had been made against their Gift Card Number and that either Amazon or Bi Lo would be able to cancel that card and issue a new one, or Credit her online Amazon Account $50 and bypass issuing a new physical card altogether. I was sadly mistaken.... when she initially contacted Amazon, they told her that since the Amazon Card was purchased from Bi Lo, we would need to take the matter up with them. I went to Bi Lo and was told that there wasn't anything that they could do and that I would need to contact Amazon. Since my Sister-in-law had already contacted Amazon and been turned away, I decided since I was the one who made the purchase and had the receipt, I would call my Credit Card Company first to see if they might be able to offer some assistance in getting the matter resolved since I had purchased all of the Gift Cards with my Credit Card. After 30 minutes discussing the details with my Credit Card Company, they said they understood my dilemma but weren't able to dispute the charge with Bi Lo. They suggested I contact Amazon directly since I had my receipt with Amazon's Gift Card number on and since it was Amazon's gift card. So... after about 30 minutes on the phone with a very nice gentleman from Amazon who made 2 attempts to get his Supervisor to approve some type of credit for the loss, he sadly informed me that Amazon isn't responsible for purchases of their Gift Cards that aren't made from their website. I told him that since Amazon isn't willing to offer any assistance, even though they can clearly see in their system a $50 unused Credit on that lost Gift Card and since I had my receipt with their Gift Card number printed on the receipt (proof that I had purchased their Gift Card), I felt as though Amazon had ROBBED me of $50, since the only one who will benefit financially from this gift transaction is Amazon and I had certainly not intended to add ""Amazon"" as one of my 2015 Christmas names to buy for! Furthermore, I told him that I would not be making any more purchases from Amazon directly or purchasing any other Amazon Gift Cards in the future and would encourage others to do the same. I try not to support businesses that engage in thievery, and that is exactly how I feel I was treated in this instance.",1.0
"Amazon gift cards are the biggest fraud I have ever seen! My husband was issued a $50 gift card from his work over a year ago and had been waiting to use it on something he or I needed. With Christmas just around the corner he and I thought it would be a great idea to use the gift card to buy gifts with. My husband spent $24 dollars and change leaving me a balance of $25 dollars to use if I wanted to buy something. I thought hey this is perfect! I can buy my nephew the movie he asked for and a few other small items for stockings and not break the bank.

Well of course life doesn't work out the way it is supposed to. Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)

Don't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.",1.0

"I just tried to buy an iPod for my daughter with our gift cards from Christmas. It turns out you can only use one gift card per order. The call rep I spoke with acted like it was very generous that Amazon allows customers to combine both credit cards and gift cards in one order.  She repeatedly sited ""security reasons"" as why I could only use one gift card at a time.

Considering Amazon issued the gift cards AND my credit card, I don't understand how they can't figure out security issues that would then allow me to actually use these things. I wouldn't have thought Amazon would be so petty as to cause customers to make multiple orders on low cost items and force cash or credit payments for higher cost ones, but that is obviously the case. It is even more irritating that they sell gift cards for $100 but I couldn't use two at $25. I will definitely NOT be buying any more gift cards from Amazon.",1.0

""One-day shipping"" is a total joke in my case.  Yes, I could have done the one where I email it to my dad or print it out, but I thought I'd do something nicer that I could put in the card I'm sending him.  That card has yet to go out.

I must contact the person who purchased it and that person must go back to he store that sold it to them. That person is 2 time zones away and we all live busy lives. The trouble it would take to make this happen is great and I'm sure Amazon knows it.

I think the maker of the shoddy product should accept reponsibility for selling lemons. Own up Amazon. I have the card and receipt. Why can't I ship the card and receipt directly to Amazon and have Amazon credit my account?

"First time I've ever had a problem with getting an item through Amazon, but since I never got my gift card, (but got charged for it), I have to rate this pretty low. I guess what bothers me most is that Amazon wants to make it hard to contact them. The online ""manage your stuff"" section did me no good as I couldn't tell them it got lost nor could I tell them to cancel it and let's try again. The card has been ""stuck"" at some mail sorting center in Capitol Heights MD, but I have no tools or options to fix this situation. I've always been pleased with Amazon and although they don't control much of the logistics, they need to take more responsibility as the point of contact with the end customer.",1.0
"U.S.P.S delivery tracking claims that my gift card was delivered, but I never got it. This appears to be the first item ever stolen from my mailbox in 7 1/2 years. I suspect that Amazon puts ""Amazon.com"" as the return address, thereby alerting EVERYONE that it contains a gift card, which of couse ANYONE can use.

The upshot is that I'm out the $25.00 I paid to Amazon, and Amazon provides no way for me to even inform them that the gift card was stolen/lost.
My recommendation: Don't buy Amazon gift cards. They are sitting ducks.
Instead, give a check or some other type of gift card for that you buy in person.",1.0
"Be very careful with all of your Amazon gift card purchases!  Amazon is not up front in letting you know the card will not cover ALL of their merchants.  If a merchant falls into a certain category the card will not cover the purchase-even if you are directed to the merchant.  ALSO, I attempted to purchase an ITOUCH as a gift and in the promotion, I was given a $25 Amazon gift card.  I attempted to make the purchase with a $200 gift card I had previously purchased from Amazon.  Since the promotion forced me to take the $25 gift card, I was not allowed to use my $200 gift card for the purchase.  I was not aware of this until they billed my credit card company.  After 3 hours on the phone with people I had difficulty understanding, I was forced to send back the ITOUCH I originally purchased, turn in the $25 gift card and repurchase the ITOUCH with my $200 gift card.  I should also mention that when I repurchased the ITOUCH the price went up.  In short, the Amazon gift cards are only good for limited purchases and I will not be using them in the future.",1.0

They did not leave instruction for the recipient that a delivery was attempted.  They did not inform me the card had been returned.

"I ordered one $50 card to be sent directly to my sister-in-law for Christmas 3 weeks before Christmas.  I am amazon prime and the projected arrival date was the expected 2 days after purchase.  7 days later it had not shipped and I called about it.  Rep in India after much weavingf and ducking said it was delayed because it was Christmas Amazon Prime meant nothing to him but he assured me that it would ship the next day overnight to make up for it.  Two days later and no shipped notice - I called again who barely spoke English and who said they had shipped the card to me but it hand't shipped.  She hung up on me when I demanded a supervisor.  This run around continued for another 3 days when  card arrived at my house and I got a shipped notice that one was beinjg shipped to the intended by the US mail.  It arrived after Christmas and took several calls to figure out which one was the activated one.

Totally Amazon's fault for not arriving on time.  Through this whole farce, the web site showed cutomers that it could arrive the next day even though they were taking 7-10 days just to process them.  Also showed all the different shipping options and 2 day for Prime members when in reality they were being sent by mail.

I checked the box saying I wanted to use the 300.00 gift card balance option it gave me  and since the gift cards were 100.00 each, they used 1 of the 100.00 cards and charged the rest to my unprepared cedit card... I was shocked!

I wasn't prepared for that with my credit card especially after the holidays, so of course it declined the extra 200.00 I was expecting the gift cards to have covered....
and I wanted to use the 300.00 in gift cards, not my credit card on my account from previous use of Amazon.

 I called customer service and kept getting a woman who I could not understand, telling me the same thing over and over as if she was reading from a script to me, telling me she couldn't help me and would forward my issue to another department and they would get back with me by email within 12 hours.

I get an email later stating i need to choose another payment method, as my credit card delined! UM, DUH! I didn't wish to use my card, I wanted to use the gift card balance!!

So, I wrote to explain this back to them and no answer, it has been a week, and my order was cancelled.

"As a long time Amazon.com customer, a gift card seemed like a good purchase. I am just trying to purchase a card to have e-mailed. I basically wanted to convert a Visa debit gift card into an Amazon.com gift card. I put the amount of the card in, the number and expiration date. Amazon accepted it as payment, but after hours of not receiving a confirmation e-mail I checked the site to see what was going on. The site claimed they could not confirm the payment, yet they had already taken money off the Visa gift card. I contacted customer service who told me a Visa gift card is not the best way to purchase an Amazon gift card and they would refund the money to the Visa gift card. I then put in another order using my Amazon.com credit card. A card I have used thousands of times before and never had a problem. This time, I received the same message I got when using the Visa gift card. I contacted Customer Service again. The first person I spoke to told me I had a ""Block"" on the account. She could not tell me why that was there, and she informed me she could remove it immediately. This claim brought me some concern so I asked to speak with her manager to find out the reason  a ""Block"" had been placed. The manager claimed there was no ""Block"" on the card and the sale should have gone through fine. So, I again went back and checked on the sale. Again there was a message that it could not be paid using the payment option I had selected. I called back again and told them to cancel the sale. This is extremely disappointing to me, as I have felt for quite some time that Amazon was one of the last customer service oriented sellers around. I guess they too have been pushed to the ""Make money, screw the customer"" attitude this country has been forced into with our economic situation. A trusted company has gone down the drains.

"Joining the ECA is easy enough, you can purchase a card like this and they even have periodic promotions where joining costs nothing! Pretty great deal, right? After all, you get all the perks that an ECA membership has to offer like 10% off all game purchases at Amazon.com, er, wait, no...they got rid of that, all for free!

Well, it seemed like a great deal and many gamers joined at the time with the understanding that turning off the memnbership's ""auto-renew"" feature would be as easy as the radio button in the member's area of the website. Turns out, the ECA has decided that the ""auto renew"" option should never have been on the site in the first place and that the only way to cancel a subscription is to snail-mail your request. Furthermore, they can't guarantee your mailed-in request won't be misplaced so be sure to fork over the dough for certified mail. Finally, if you think you're safe because the card you used is soon to expire, don't think so fast, the ECA has decided that it is within it's rights in changing the expiration date you submitted and re-runing the transaction. What's all this mean? It means that without jumping through hoops, your card could be charged indefinitely for an ECA membership...I really hope the word gets out about this.

The irony of a consumer advocate group pulling stunts like this is almost too good to be true.",1.0
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MEMBERSHIP FOR ANY REASON

Hal, the creator of the ECA has famously stated earlier on how TOS/EULA's are so dangerous to the industry with their legal jargon and constantly changing terms. So instead of enforcing his supposed beliefs into his own organization he does the exact same thing here yet even to a higher degree, by pulling shady things like forcing users into mandatory arbitration agreements striping away their legal rights, forcing through expired credit cards by changing the date, removing the lines stating we could cancel by phone and then stating we get a notice 30 days before the subscription ends to make cancelations yet we have to submit the request to cancel at least 30 days prior to the end date. All the while making changes to the TOS with no notice this has been done and without contacting any of its members.

The ECA advertises discount that do not exist such as getting 10% off direct2drive purchases. Its advertised as a perk before joining but logging into the benefits section there is no discount for them but an expired coupon for Borderlands. It has been this way for several weeks and all requests for support just avoid the question stating they're working on new discounts or that they don't have any control over what the sponsors offer.

The situation was made entirely worse when the ECA decided to announce all of the sudden the autorenew button on the website never infact worked at all after leaving it up for several weeks. The announcement was made that users would then need to pay for certified mail to cancel which is ridiculous and seems to go directly against CT statutes prohibiting this activity. Making it difficult to cancel for users only put the message out that the ECA was only interested in taking money from its users who didn't want to put up with all the roadblocks you set up to cancel. I will say it again- the ECA has removed all methods of canceling your account online. They require a credit card at signup for a reason, they intend to do everything in their power to prevent users from canceling only to be able to charge you every year. The reasoning they say this is they want a paper trail, which is funny considering they state they're going going ""green"".

Instead of Hal and the ECA taking this opportunity to reassure members and correct the PR nightmare at hand, they instead take to attacking its members in his statement placing the blame on everyone but the ECA and still avoided important questions people were waiting on answers for.

If you go to their  forums looking for answers you will be met with a great deal of hostility from the moderators who instead of offering help and answers simply deleted threads and threatened bans for asking questions that had been asked before, while at the same time refusing to give the actual answer or where they could find it. Again, you will get banned for asking for help there.

The ECA is a scam. They will steal your money and instead of fighting for consumer advocacy and rights they suppress them.",1.0
"As others have mentioned, the ECA is a shady organization masquerading under the guise of an advocacy group for gaming rights and first amendment protections for videogames.  Initially, the group offered a number of benefits as perks for membership, but of those, many are offers that you can get on one's own at any time (such as a free trial of Gamefly).  The best perks have been dropped.

The greater problem is that in order to activate membership, you are required to provide a credit card number, even for a pre-purchased membership or a free membership (given through various promotions). They make it very easy to become a member.  However, they make it nearly impossible to stop being a member.  The ECA charges regular fees that you cannot get out of unless you cancel your member ship through a very specific form of WRITTEN correspondence (no e-mail or website help at all), and well in advance of your membership due date.

If you have recently become a member, I suggest you begin the proceedings to cancel now, and keep multiple copies of everything you send and receive.  You might just get out of your contract by 2011.",1.0
"Beware of signing up with ECA.  They claim to represent the best interests of gamers, and that sounds great on paper, but they way they treat you when they get your credit card on file is far from being in your best interests.

The have continuously changed and edited their Terms of Service without asking members to re-accept the new terms, as most legitimate organizations will do (most organizations let you know the TOS has changed, not the ECA).

Their Terms of Service clearly states AT THIS TIME they will change the expiration date on your credit card if your card expires.  They will change the expiration date until they get a ""hit"" to continue to charge you a fee.

If you try to simply cancel your credit card on file with them to stop them from charging you, their President has stated they will file fraud charges against you through your credit card company.

The only way to cancel your membership is by sending a snail mail letter.  Yes, you can sign up on their website very easily, but have to send a letter in the mail to cancel.  They also state they will not confirm receipt of your cancellation letter, meaning if it is ""lost"" in the mail, they will continue to charge you.

Their forums on their website have banned all new registrants the past few days without people even making one post.  New registrations to their forums have also been shut down at this time.

When your first year of membership is up, they say they will inform you with 30 days left that your account membership will be auto-renwed for another $20, problem is, if you want to cancel, they have to receive your letter in the mail BEFORE the final 30 days.  So when you get the notice that they are going to auto renew you for another year, it is already to late to cancel since you CANNOT cancel your membership on their website or by phone.

Finally, simply check out their Better Business Bureau rating.  It states as I type this that ""This business is not currently rated. BBB has recently received numerous complaints against this business, and will issue a rating after it has fully evaluated them.""

"I joined the ECA because I thought they were FOR gamers rights. While the stated goals of the ECA are noble the organization itself is anything but. Your membership with the ECA auto renews each year and they have recently changed their cancellation policy (with no proper notification to it's members of this change) to state that the the ONLY way to cancel your membership with them is to mail them a letter which is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.

 This arcane cancellation process was defended by the ECA by calling many of it's own members who did not wish to cancel in this manner ""lazy"". You have NO option to cancel on their website, not through email, and not by telephone.

Fight for gamers rights by NOT supporting the ECA in any way, shape, or form.",1.0
"Gamers Unite! Against the ECA, that is.

Be warned, membership in the ECA requires your credit card being on file and you accept automatic yearly renewal. The only way to cancel your membership is with a written letter via Certified Mail. This is unacceptable.

All the decent member benefits have been discontinued and I can see no evidence that the ECA is fighting for consumer rights in any way.",1.0
I joined the eca for the discount on amazon which is no longer available. Now when I am trying to cancel my membership I have to send a letter to the eca because they have taken off the ability to cancel online(Most likely because of the huge amount cancellations because of the amazon discount).They offer very little and use very deceptive practices to keep you as a paying member(Changing the date on your credit card after it expires).,1.0

I bought it for my aunt as she has a Kindle so thought she could order some books. There was a problem as she has a Canadian account.,1.0
"I doubt I shall use this ""service"" again. Whilst it was convenient and simple enough, I have just received my Amex bill and note I have been charged for an adverse currency conversion and conversion commission, neither of which I was made aware of whilst undertaking the transaction, and that this has cost me over 10% more than I expected. I don't like surprises.",1.0

"Ordered gift cards on December 14th, still have not received them.  Today is December 26th.  Was refused any type of recourse by customer service apparently because my expected delivery date was not December 24th exactly, despite cards being for Christmas.  Expected delivery was Dec. 17.  That makes zero sense and I have no faith in this company any more.  Order at your own risk...",1.0
"This was an unauthorized purchase made by someone who had access to my credit card.  After a couple rounds with the fine folks at Amazon and the credit card company, the issue was resolved.  The person who used my card apparently was caught and fired since the card or the account was not compromised since.",1.0

The only reason I have given this 1 star is because I was given the wrong information. I bought a kobo e reader for my daughter & was told I could use amazon on it. I can't & have wastes my money.,1.0
"I purchased the gift card on line to print at home as a Christmas gift to someone who was receiving a Kindle as a gift.  The link that was sent did not work and after talking to customer service TWICE and them re-sending the link it still would not open and print.  The refund was not sent until 12/30, 6 days after the failed purchase.  I had to go out to a store and find a gift card to give during my family Christmas gift exchange.  Not a good experience, will probably NEVER use Amazon on line again.",1.0

always struggle with amazon gift cards - especially for my sister - it just never reaches in time! and there is a lot of hassle and calling backward and forward! Otherwise its okay,1.0
"I gave this twice last year as a gift via email, as Amazon offers. But the person to whom I gave the gift couldn't access the required code in order to redeem his gift card on Amazon to shop. I had to get them refunded, and simply mail him a check. wish Amazon would fix that and make it easier for recipients to use.",1.0
Was never able to get this card emailed to my friend.  Even Amazon couldn't get it to go. Amazon was good about refunding my money.,1.0

"I decided to give my grandma this email gift card for Christmas and the image never showed up in the email to my grandma.  I had my grandma forward the email to me and it wouldn't show up in my yahoo account either.  I then forwarded the email to my husband's account and it didn't show the image under his email provider either.  The image is what has the claim code, the message I typed, and the amount of the gift card.  I would do this again if Amazon would have an alternative so that the information would should outside of the image incase you can't view the image.",1.0
"If I am incorrect, please forgive me, but as far as I have been able to establish, the person to whom the gift card was sent IS NOT ABLE TO USE IT AT ALL. I live in South Africa, and so does the recipient of the gift card. It appears that purchases may not be made on the card from South Africa. Whether the recipient wants to purchase software applications or physical goods to be shipped makes no difference. Apparently Amazon does not ship to South Africa. There may be a good reason for this, but why can you not sell games/applications to people in South Africa? These things do not require physical delivery. And if this is the case, why do you not have some kind of control in place to warn people with South African based e-mail addresses that their gift cards will be completely valueless, which is the minimum any consumer would be entitled to expect in such a case? Amazon was prepared to take my $75.00 and send the gift card to an e-mail address in South Africa, but now refuses to honour the card. I would be delighted if I am mistaken as to any of the above, and would appreciate your feedback on this matter. I trust that you will take the time to respond to this.",1.0
We are new Amazon shoppers. Unfortunately a couple of the clothing items did not fit. Since they were not Prime items my wife has had difficulty obtaining reimbursement for the returned items. As a result of the $100 I spent on her gift certificate. Only $60 ended up being used. The other $40 was unfortunately spent on seemingly non-returnable items. As a result we will not be purchasing a gift certificate again. And will stick to Prime merchandise.,1.0
I had a very frustrating experience trying to send this gift card. Probably won't do that again.,1.0
Purchased similar item from QVC.  Bought 2 from amazon.com.  Fell apart when I used it.  I put in the trash.,1.0

I bought this giftcard for my daughter and 2 granddaughters for them to be able to buy the prime from Amazon for the 2 Kindle Fires I bought my grandaughters for Christmas.  When my daughter went to use the gift card for the purchase; she was informed that she would not be able to use that for the prime purchase. This upset me very much and if I had know that I would not have bought the gift card.,1.0
This was an attempt to steal my identity and I am thankful that it was nipped in the bud. This is a great example of why email notifications of your purchases are so valuable!,1.0
If I had read more carefully it would have been better. I wanted to print this so I thought I would just email it to myself. I guess I clicked on the wrong gift card. Anyway I didn't give this to my neighbor's daughter for her wedding. I forwarded this to my son for Father's Day instead.,1.0
I bought it for my niece in Brazil but she wasn't able to use it.,1.0

It took over 5 hours to send.. I don't suggest using this if ur in a rush.,1.0
"Like others, I sent an electronic gift card and it was redeemed by someone other than the recipient.  This was confirmed by customer service but there was no recourse and I was out $50. Like others this was then forwarded to the fraud department and nothing never came of it. Amazon gift cards, particularly ecards are not safe to use.  You cannot be sure they will be hacked. And you will always be put the money.  Might as well throw the money out the window and hope the recipient catches it.",1.0
"I am so upset. I ordered a $25 gift card from amazon. I didn't get it! This is the last time Ill be shopping on this site. I tried contacting someone but it was trying to get me to pay them to figure out the answer and where my card is. They said estimated time it would come to my email inbox was 15 minutes. That was this morning. Now its been a good six hours and nothing.
I want my money back. If anyone knows how to contact someone with this company, let me know!!

Buy your gift card with caution!!",1.0

I ordered this gift card with a delivery method within 5 minutes. The recipient never got it.... never will purchase again,1.0
"We were trying to save trees and hassle for people who wanted to give us gift cards.  We assumed, like everything else on Amazon, that this process would be easy and convenient.  However, we ran into the following problems:

1.  It was not easy/intuitive to even get the gift cards onto the registry
2.  It was harder than it seems like it should have been to receive the gift cards
3.  The emails to redeem the gift cards did not work more than half of the time.

To expand on #2, I don't know why a wedding registry linked to my Amazon account could not just automatically deposit the gift card balance onto my Amazon account.  The process is that you get an email sent to your email address and then you redeem the gift card using the code in your email.  Although inefficient and mildly annoying, this process would be fine if it worked consistently.

However, in more than half of the instances where people bought us these cards, it did not work; we did not receive the emails with the proper codes in them even though we received a note from Amazon saying that a gift card had been purchased.  Granted, the times that it didn't go through could have been due to our guests mis-typing our email address.  But even though we could see that the guests bought us the gift card, there is nothing we could do on our side to get the credit according to Amazon support.

So we were left in the unenviable position of having to contact our guests and have THEM deal with Amazon customer service to get the problem resolved, which is mildly embarrassing.

The customer service guy I talked to said that privacy was the reason that these could not be directly linked to our Amazon account, but it seemed that this would be by far the most efficient way to redeem these cards.  I'm guessing this inefficient process is at least partially intentional so that at least part of the gift cards purchased do not get redeemed, making Amazon more money.  It's disappointing.",1.0
Not received!! This is awful.,1.0
"I bought this for my staff.  It was sent, but we didn't get confirmation that our staff received it or anything after the purchase.  We had to ask staff after a week of purchasing it if they received it.  They confirmed, but I would rather have received the confirmation from Amazon.  We were worried that we typed in the staff person's email incorrectly.  Not worth the wonder.  Rather get a physical card and KNOW that the recipient received it.",1.0

"I just gave this a 1 star review because the question is so stupid. Unless Amazon is a phony company that sells bogus gift cards, which we know its not, how can this purchase be rated.

The designs are okay but need work on promotional codes with this item - if your order somehow gets canceled you will not be able to get the promotion again even though you never got to successfully use it the first time - its too bad.

"""Claim code"" was unreadable when opened because these gift cards are of such bad quality.  I can't redeem the $50 until Amazon clears this up, which is somehow taking hours.  You would think it would be easy to redeem with the ""Card #"" or ""bar code"" but it's a nightmare.  I get the feeling they make it difficult on purpose just to frustrate people and prevent them from redeeming the cards.  Zero stars.  Like a lot of Amazon services, very disappointing.",1.0

"I have to order from Amazon.com. But I live in France. It seems as if all the things that I want don't ship to France. Electronics...nope. Watches...nope. Shoes, scarfs...nope. I keep visiting your site looking for something that I want that ships to France, but there's nothing so far. And I have to keep postage in mind, and the shipping from the US to France is expensive. Now, if the card could be used with Amazon.fr, the story would be different. I could order things that I want, maybe get free or low postage.",1.0

"CAUTION: I purchased a $200.00 Amazon Gift Card for Christmas for my son, and had it sent to me so I could send it to him with a personal card and note. The card was stolen in the mail and used by the thief (likely a postal employee). Amazon refused to replace the card or make a refund, even though, they know who illegally used the card. Amazon places the activation code on the back of the card so that whoever has the card, legitimately or illegitimately, can use it.

I also purchased Walmart gift cards to send to other relatives and had them sent to me so I could also send them with personal messages. Walmart mailed the cards to me, but emailed me the activation code. One of these cards was also stolen in the mail at the same time the Amazon card was stolen; however, since the activation code was not on the card, it could not be used by the thief. Walmart replaced this stolen card free of charge and sent it directly to my intended recipient.

Walmart does their gift cards properly, Amazon does not. Amazon will no longer be on my shopping list.",1.0

REALLY disappointed and still wonder why with nothing to do but deliver to his email it was delayed so long. Called Amazon about an answer for why but STILL have yet to hear anything. Became one of their VISA cardmembers a couple of months ago and seriously thinking about going with another since I won't be buying any more gift cards from AMAZON anymore.,1.0
I don't know if they got it ????,1.0

"Please check on this one as I did not purchase a $100 Amazon gift card. Is someone else using my account?

"The above item was requested for immediate delivery on 5/24/14.  I was notified that it had been sent but never informed it was delivered.  I had to go through customer service to have it delivered.

Also on 5/11/14  I ordered another gift card to be delivered to a different recipient which was marked as sent but never as  delivered.  After contacting customer service I was informed that it was undeliverable and the charge was credited to my credit card.

The problem is I was never contacted about these problems.  Up until now I thought Amazon Gift  Cards was a great idea.  However, I NO LONGER HAVE ANY FAITH THAT I CAN ORDER A GIFT CARD AND BELIEVE IT WILL BE DELIVERED.  Especially since I am never notified that there is a problem with the delivery (the most important part).  I am extremely disappointed.

From my last two experiences it is apparent that Amazon has a problem with deliveries and/or notifying the customer when it occurs and trying to work the problem out.",1.0
"Very unhappy as am unable to use this Gift Card at Amazon.com.au.  At no time when purchasing the card was I informed that the card can only be used at Amazon.com and you can't use it at Amazon.com.au.
Understand that there are different country sites but your site does not state this when purchasing Gift Cards. The Gift Card was for my mother for Mothers Day and she is unable to use it because her account is with .com.au not just .com.
Very unsatisified.....now I have a gift card with $100 US on it..........  :(",1.0
I wanted a gift card to come in an envelope in the mail like last time I ordered. Your order page isn't very customer friendly . It says to pick name of design and amount. when you do one it deletes the other. now I get an email i can't wrap up and give my sister for her  birthday in 3 weeks.,1.0
"I checked with my daughter in Australia, who was meant to be the recipient, a fortnight after her birthday, and the gift card had not arrived. She has undertaken to chase it up.

Amazon policy prohibits using a card that is not attached to a bank account for purposes of turning off the ads on a KINDLE !!!!!!!!  What kind of crap is this?????? I spent my hard earned money on the card and it was useless,,,,,, what a rip off and a waste of my money. I will never by another gift card from or for Amazon.",1.0

"I purchased this gift card the day before the person's birthday and asked for it to be sent on his birthday.  When he hadn't received it a couple of days later, I went to the on-line chat box for help.  I was connected to someone who told me that the website was experiencing technical difficulties with sending gift cards.  It would have been far more helpful had the website indicated this difficulty so that a person could decide whether to buy one or not.  Several days later, it was still not delivered, so I had to go in and resend it.",1.0

It take me long time to wait for the gift card.,1.0
I love the convenience of this option especially since my younger siblings all use Facebook to communicate with me. I don't appreciate that the gift card posts to the recipient's public-facing wall along with my personalized message. It also seems to run counter to the spirit of gift-giving to have this act of giving forcefully broadcasted to the recipient's friends. I would use this much more frequently if it could be sent via their Facebook inbox.,1.0
I had chosen a retirement theme card and after repeated tries I was given just the generic amazon gift paper that I printed--- I had hoped for the tropical island or something similar that made it stand out more as a celebration.,1.0

I DID TELL THE YOUNG LADY ON THE PHONE NUMEROUS TIMES THAT IT WAS AUGUST 5TH AND THAT THE 3RD COMES BEFORE THE 5TH!!!

"I have sent Amazon gift cards to numberous persons as gifts, directly from the Amazon site or as part of an American Greeting ecard.

If I order a package to be delivered by mail, I get a tracking number and can follow it to destination.  No so with Amazon gift card.  It seems as if Amazon is not only fine with not providing the feedback, it is in their interest for the card to never be used.  More transparency is needed.",1.0

"This is my go-to winter hand cream. Amazing smell, such a nice creamy feel and keeps my hands very hydrated.",5.0
"First off, my metal bottle and the pump arrived totally undamaged and fully functioning (this was something others had complained about).

The scent is kind of a spicy herb smell.  Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).

I'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.  This is a must have for people whose hands or other parts of the body start to bleed during the winter without constant attention.  I wouldn't recommend it for daily full body application due to the price and thickness, but it's great for targeting problem areas.",5.0
very good,5.0
This handcream has a beautiful fragrance. It doesnt stay on or protect your hands through washing.  This size is quite small.,5.0

"I've tried many, many different hand lotions, but have never found one that works as well as this one.  I put this on my hands (you don't need much), then put on a pair of spa gloves for about a 1/2 hours.  Awesome results!  Even better when you use the Gardener's Pumice first!!",5.0

The BEST hand cream you will ever use! Leaves your hands super soft and hydrated. It's like a drink of water for your hands.,5.0
"This is not an inexpensive product but it is the very best hand lotion that I've ever used.  When I pump a bit on my hands and spread it into my skin, my hands stop being dry and uncomfortable, although it's a classic case of, ""I didn't know that they hurt until they stopped hurting.""  I've never used anything nearly as effective.  I'm male and often work outdoors and with my hands and caring for my skin is simply not something that I do.  This stuff, though, works.",5.0
My favorite lotion hands down (pun intended). Smells divine and makes my hands really soft. This is my third bottle. The last one lasted a year and it has been on my desk all that time...I use it every day. Great quality.,5.0
"I was told by my dad to pick up a trade while I was an undergrad, and that trade was beauty. I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.

Someone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!

Skip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!

You cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.

I remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!

The pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.

My mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.

As she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her. We love this stuff, and if it came by the gallon, we'd invest in tubs!",5.0
Best hand cream ever,5.0
"Favorite and first go-to tool in my gardening kit!!! Try this: 1) Slather hands, with excess under your nails. 2) Don gardening gloves. 3) Garden till you drop! 4) Remove gloves, wash hands, and enjoy the lovely soft skin! :)",5.0

Softens and restores my dry cracked hands. Lovely fragrance. I use it twice a day . Once when I leave for work and again before bed when I know it will have time to absorb.

"This is one of my favorite lotions ever! I first received it as a gift, and I have loved it ever since. You don't have to be a gardener to use Crabtree & Evelyn's Gardener's Ultra-Moisturizing Hand Therapy Lotion. It's terrific for dry winter skin too. Not only does it feel wonderful, but its spicy aroma is very appealing as well.",5.0
Best hand lotion ever. In everyone's opinion who has tried it!,5.0
"Great product, just don't love the price! I'd love for C&E to make a refill option. The metal pump container would last forever.",5.0
"I bought this for my daughter. She LOVES it!! She had a hard time finding it, so I looked on Amazon and was happy to see it was available here. Thanks! The purse size is awesome too so she can use it away from home.",5.0
This is by far my favorite hand lotion. Have been using it for years it goes on soft and smooth. The tube will last for a while and a little goes a long way. Perfect for anyone who works outside or in. Thank you Crabtree.,5.0
Great service. Great price! Very happy.,5.0

A keeper.,5.0
Love this hand cream!,5.0
"Holy cow this stuff smells amazing and feels great. It's just the right type of lotion, not too runny or slippery like other brands.

It's pricey but so worth it. Don't bring this to work because everyone will want to use it. Seriously you guys stop taking my lotion.",5.0
Great product for hands.  It works great and has a fresh light scent.  Absorbs into skin and is nongreasy.  I would recommend this product for soft smooth hands.,5.0
"I will put up with a lot of shenanegans in this life but slimy, sticky, stinky, useless hand lotion ISN'T one of those things.. I've been using this lotion for YEARS!!! I love it. It smells clean and warm but not like someone's sickly grandma.",5.0
Fantastic smell,5.0
"Have been using for years, great product.",5.0
This is the best hand lotion I have every used.  It is expensive but it softens your hands and smells good too.,5.0
"Great aroma to this lotion. It was suggested to me by a friend as not too perfumy, and I agree. Nice rich coverage for garden-weary finger tips.",5.0
"Love this lotion - thickness, fragrance and dryness healing power!",5.0
This product is the best at repairing dry skin!,5.0
The two bottles were brand new and arrived in timely manner.,5.0
"Love this stuff, and because it's a big size I can keep it handy.",5.0
I can't live without this lotion - I mix it half and half with Aveeno and it's the only thing that keeps my hands from terrible dryness and the combo smells so nice - love this lotion!,5.0
"Love the scent of this product. It is strong however, also does an amazing job of fixing dry gardeners hands. I use it daily.",5.0
"I've used it for years.  Still the best.  Havent found anything better than this for my hands, legs and arms.",5.0
"A friend turned me on to this hand cream about ten years ago.  It's not greasy, absorbs into your skin pretty quickly, and smells GOOD, unlike medicated creams.  Believe it has rosemary in the ingredients.  I usually order two pump bottles at a time so I won't run out during the outdoor working seasons.  I have had rough hands my entire life, but once I put this lotion on them, my hands feel wonderful,  and are soft and normal appearing.  I'd recommend Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's hand cream to anyone who has rough and dry skin but has found it difficult to locate a solution for their problem.  It really works!",5.0
"I love this hand lotion, it was first given to me by a friend and I have used it (sparingly) ever since.  I love the smell and it is good for my hands.  I got this one for my mom, it's a little pricey for me to get often for myself.",5.0
"This product is entirely responsible for my hands surviving the cold New England winters.  I've tried everything under the sun and snow for my hands, and this is the only thing that truly works.  Take it from somebody that works with his hands all day and washes a good dozen times a day.  In years past (before discovering this product), my knuckles would actually start bleeding from dryness in the winter.  Now all I need to do is apply a liberal slathering on my hands before going to sleep and I wake up with soft hands, ready to work another day.  It smells good, too!",5.0
Excellent product that I have used before and it works extremely well with dry hands.  Anyone having problems with dry hands will appreciate this product and will probably never be without it after using it.,5.0
"Perfect consistency and not greasy; no perfumey-like scent, which my husband especially appreciates for his use. We've tried many hand creams over the years and this has been the winner for a long time now.",5.0
"Even though this is targeted for gardeners -- of which I am one -- I use it all year round for feet,  elbows, knees and dishpan hands. I love the scent and emollience: it really moisturizes without being greasy. I highly recommend this product.",5.0
My son used some of this hand cream when I had it and is now a daily user and fan. I bought him some as a surprise. He has very dry and chapped hands. This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet. Good stuff!,5.0
This stuff is great and even my husband love the smell. While it is not strong it is not 'girly' so he loves using the lotion. You won't believe how great it is till you try it. I can have terrible dry elbows or flaking hands and one use and it is completely back to smooth and healthy looking.,5.0
"I've used the Gardener's Hand Therapy for many years, but always in that metal tube. This pump is so much more convenient! Lasts a long time and is the same, rich creme you expect from this line.",5.0
"I have tried many hand creams/lotions and this is by far the best. The pump bottle
has such a charming label! Nice to have by the kitchen sink.",5.0
"This lotion is the very best for those tired, dry, scaly hands.  It is wonderful and using it continuously will heal those cracking, dry hands.",5.0
Makes my hands feel great but most of all I LOVE the smell.  Not too oily....just right.  Thats all I have to say Amazon :),5.0
"I have been buying this product for years, and absolutely love it.  It goes on so easily, and makes my hands feel and look softer and less ""old lady-ish.""  Love this product and love Amazon's price for it!",5.0
"Hand is woman's second face. This hand-cream moisturizes my hands,make them feel comfortable under air-condition. It is very useful in winter,love it.",5.0
"Used it for years and love it.  Great for summer gardening or winter ""dry hands"" use and protection.  or winter use.",5.0
"I was first given Gardeners as a gift in October.  I liked it instantly.  It's smooth, absorbent and smells great.  I wish more retail stores carried Crabtree and Evelyn.",5.0
I have used this lotion for years. Glad I got it so quickly!  Very happy customer.  The price was fantastic!,5.0
"My coworker bought this for me in 2008 when my hands were cracked and bleeding during the winter. I've used it every winter since and still had a bit left in the tube come 2014. Love the smell (as does my husband - entirely unisex). Love the feel. Love love LOVE the difference it makes in my skin. No other lotion has ever come close and I'm resolved to be exclusively committed to this one, so I finally bought a pump bottle. It may seem expensive, but for how long it lasts and how well it works, it's worth every penny.",5.0
"This cream has a great smell and stays moist.  I don't know what is in the bottle, but I love it.  It real gives moisture to your skin.",5.0
My wife uses this hand cream exclusive of any other. I make sure to buy multiple bottles so she is well stocked up. Found this item at a great price. My wife was very happy.,5.0
"There isn't anything that I don't love about this product. The smell is especially addicting - along with all those other perks = quality, quality and quality!

Oh, and before I forget = the 8 ounce container creates a great savings in addition to providing easy, pump-ready application.",5.0
"My wife loves this cream and swears it is the best hand cream she has ever used.  Like the subject says, if she's happy, then I am happy.  I will buy more when this jars runs low.",5.0
"I have used this lotion before so I already knew that I loved it !  It is awesome on my extremely dry and cracking hands. I don't garden but I have my hands in water and soap many times during the day. This is the first time I have gotten the bottle--have always had the tube before. The tube is convenient if you don't have a place for the bottle, but if you have a place to keep the bottle, I find it is much easier to use and I tend to use it more often.  I keep the bottle on my kitchen cabinet and a tube in my car!",5.0
"I keep this by my kitchen sink. After every washing, I add the hand lotion which really helps keep chapped hands at bay.",5.0
Great product for my hands.  I have dry skin and I'm a gardner.  This hand lotion works for me and it has a subtle fragrance that's not overpowering like so many products out there.,5.0
"This hand cream works better than any other I have found on the market.  I first found this product many years ago.  Because of the price I have tried many others since then but nothing works the same, so I'm back!",5.0
Have used Gardeners for years and found that nothing softens and soothes hands like it. A bit pricey but worth it.,5.0
"This cream has wax in it, great for the nails, and really makes your skin look years younger!  I use it at night",5.0
"My all time favorite hand lotion!  It's deeply moisturizing, but without the greasy feeling. Moisture lasts a long time, so I don't have to re-apply too often.",5.0
I've been using this hand lotion for years because it is the best lotion available.  It will heal dry hands overnight.,5.0
This is my wife's favorite lotion and is always on her Christmas list.  The container looks nice and can be left on the counter for quick use.,5.0
"I discovered the Gardeners Hand Therapy years ago at a little B & B in Alamosa, Colorado.  First, I loved the scent - it's pretty light and very pleasing.  The lotion itself is thick and healing (as in the name).

This hand lotion costs quite a bit more when ordered from Crabree & Evelyn, so I highly recommend Amazon for finding a much better deal on it.

Finally, the pump bottle lasts me a really long time - months really.  I still ordered two, however.",5.0
"I'm a 40 year old married dude-  I have bought this stuff in the past when I could justify 30 bucks for a thing of lotion. Last time I bought it was 5 years ago- and since, I've justified buying all names of other lotions which were all cheaper- with the same results: They didn't work.

I was at the mall with my wife this weekend- bought this for the first time in 5 years. I have used about half a pump every morning since and now I remember what I was missing. It does not take a lot- does not have the greasy or even watery consistency of some lotions- I have noticed a difference in my dry skin in just a few days. I will try to reserve this for winters- it is still very expensive to justify for year round use but I can't down rate it for that.  It has a smell- like fresh marjoram (yeah- what?)- It isn't flowery or perfumed- but not ""manly"" either- doesn't smell like motor oil or muskrat.

Awesome stuff.",5.0
"As a nurse, I wash my hands frequently all day long. This is the best moisturizer I have found. It prevents cracked bleeding hands and never feels greasy. I use it daily year round.",5.0
"This is absolutely the best lotion.  I use it all the time on my feet and hands.  It is creamy, NOT greasy and smells terrific too!  I love it so much that I also buy it in travel sizes for my purse.  The only con with this is that when it gets to the end it no longer pulls through the pump and there is quite a bit left.  With this being as expensive as it is, you don't want to waste it.  I turn it upside down in an old small baby food jar and it fills the jar quite a bit...easily 1 - 2 ounces.",5.0
This is hands down (pun intended) the best hand lotion on the planet and it is worth every penny. It is the only one I will buy.,5.0
"My favorite!  I put it on my feet before bed, and then put socks on, and when I wake up, my feet are silky smooth!",5.0
"Best hand cream I've ever used, and I NEVER use hand cream. This year, I got a puppy and with it comes a lot of mess and handwashing. Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you've got dry, painful hands. I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess. I have a mini tube in my handbag, large pump at the office, an 1in my home. I like the stuff to say the least!",5.0
"This stuff is amazing!  Not slimy, but makes hands much smoother.  Also has a neutral smell that is not feminine or masculine.",5.0
Great product in convenient pump bottle.  I have used this product for years and it is my favorite for sure.  Fast shipping.,5.0
"This hand care product is the best I've used in many years.  I've tried dozens of hand lotions over the years and this product absorbs quickly, has a light and pleasant fragrance and just simply works great.  I will be reordering in the future.",5.0
I have used this before after receiving it as a gift. Amazon has a far better price. This is great for summer gardening hands or for dry winter hands.,5.0
I love this hand lotion as it is so soothing to my hands. I do a lot of yard work and like to treat myself by putting this lotion on each night before bed.,5.0
"This is ""hands down"" my very favorite lotion to use on my hands when I retire for the night because it is thick and smells so good.",5.0
Bought for several people as gifts.  They loved the lotion and all were very happy with it.  Can't go wrong as a gift and smells great as well.,5.0
"I like all the hand moisturizers Crabtree & Evelyn carries but especially this one.  There's no fragrance, which is fine with me.  It's an excellent moisturizer.",5.0
"My wife gets very dry, cracked hands all the time, and I get dry, peely knuckles when it's really cold.

This soaks in and stays on for a long time.  It is the only thing that actually helps.",5.0
I use this product every night.  Very soothing odor.  Would use it more often during the day but it's not an inexpensive product so I only apply this one on a limited routine.,5.0
"Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years.  While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face.  This product is not greasy.  It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all.  My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps.  It's not a cure, of course.  There really isn't one.  But it helps the skin feel better.  Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since.  It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it.  Thanks again, Amazon.",5.0
"i use this product before, and i fall in love with smell (not too strong) and make my hand so soft",5.0
I have used this for 15 years since my daughter gifted me with it originally and still like it.  It isn't greasy.,5.0
"Fantastic product, larger  size makes it great to have in the house and more economical as well. I still have a small tube for my vehicle.",5.0
My husband and I use this on our hands and feet. I have tried so many different lotions to treat dry cracked heels but I always come back to this one. It is a little pricey but always does the job well.,5.0
I bought this for my sister as a gift. She lives in a northern state and in the winter her hands sometimes bleed from the dryness and cold.  This is the only product that helps her and she was so happy to get an extra large bottle!,5.0
"This is the best product for anybody's skin. Men can use this to treat ""leather"" hands. This doesn't leave a residue behind either.",5.0
I wash my hands a ton and they get dry and cracked at the nuckles.  This is the best lotion ever.  A little goes a long way.,5.0
"Although pricey, this has got to be one of the best hand creams out there. Have been using it for yrs, originally bought in a store in Mystic Ct and loved it.",5.0
"I'm not a gardener, but my skin gets very dry in a cold weather, and this is so far the best product ever. I also delighted how it smells--",5.0
"This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.  It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angela-s-Garden-7120-921-Kids-Garden-Glove-Honey-Bee/dp/B000P8DHQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee</a>, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell.",5.0
"My husband uses this hand cream exclusively to the tune
of about 5 pump bottles per year. It is non greasy,effective
and although pricey-worth the money because he uses
it and there is no waste-none being blotted off. A great choice!",5.0
"This is my all-time favorite hand lotion. I've gotten so many people hooked on this stuff. I've been buying it for probably 10 years now. I only go thru a bottle a year because I mostly use it in the winter, but it's also great for removing eye make-up because it has some oil in it.

It's not a very oily cream as long as you use just a little bit. It's not a hand ""lotion"" like most lotions. It's thicker, so you really only need a little bit. It spreads around really well. It does feel a little heavy at first, but it soaks into the skin quickly, which I love.

The scent is heavenly. It's light and fresh, like walking outdoors. It smells almost like a Christmas tree, but the scent is not heavy or cloying. I just love it. :)",5.0
Love this product and was so glad to find it on Amazon.com!!!! Made it very easy to purchase....used these products in 2 different fragrancies for years.  Kudos for having it on your website!!,5.0
"Now that the seasons are changing my hands are getting dry, dry, dry, just like they always do. Nothing beats Crabtree & Evelyn's hand creams for dry hands. This was at a GREAT price too. It arrived as expected in perfect, new condition. If you have dry hands I highly recommend you try one of C&E's hand creams.",5.0
"Crabtree & Evelyn Gardeners Hand Therapy is the best!! We have tried other brands, however nothing gets rid of rough skin on hands and fingers like Crabtree & Evelyn Gardeners Hand Therapy. This is the first time we have purchased the pump bottle & like that much better than the tube.",5.0
"I have used thie product for a few years now.  But, when I tried to purchase at the store, the price was doubled.  Therefore, I checked with Amazon and found it at a great price.
P.S.  This is the best hand cream for dry, cracked skin.  Love it.
Thank you for carrying this product.",5.0
"I live in an area that has a humidity level of about 11% so all the natural moisture in my skin just gets sucked into the atmosphere.  However, this product really helps restore moisture without being greasy.  I probably use it 3 or 4 times a day including right at bedtime and in conjunction with the nail and cuticle therapy sister-product.  My hands are no longer snagging knit and terry fabrics.  I hate that the product is expensive but I plan to keep buying it because of how well it works.",5.0
"I had this item sent directly to my mother.  She received it on time for Mother's day and enjoys the product.

Her one comment was it did not indicate who the item was from.

She wanted me to try it; when I did, the pump did not work.  I noticed the bottle was dented in two places.  It looked used.  I was disappointed in the packaging. Nevertheless, my mother likes it, so that is what is important.",5.0
"I have been using this hand cream for many years but ordering through C & E has become very pricey for one living on a fixed income.  Since I now order Oil of Olay through Amazon, I thought I would check out Hand Therapy and there it was at a very discounted price.  I have never had any trouble with the dispenser but would recommend that as the dispenser gets close to empty to turn it up side down over a small bowl.  There will be at least an inch left of the hand cream.  The only downside is that this container is not recyclable or refillable.  This is nongreasy and feels wonderful on very dry skin.",5.0
"As a Firefighter, my hands become cracked and extremely dry.  I have tried many creams and lotions to combat this problem with little success.  While the price of this product may seem a bit high, it is worth every penny plus. It works almost overnight. Absolutely Fabulous.",5.0
"My hands/fingers chap, crack, and bleed every winter. This lotion is fantastic though! I rated the item, not the price, which is too high in my opinion. It's on my wishlist for Christmas every year though! Smells great, feels great, and most importantly, it does a great job!",5.0
"For years each winter, I have suffered through having cracked skin on my fingers, right at the two edges of the nails.  I consigned myself to applying moisturizer to the cracked area and a band-aid whenever this happened and waiting for days for the fissure to heal up.  I also tried to keep my fingernails as short as possible to help prevent the cracks from forming in the first place.  What a royal pain!  Then I tried applying C&E's Gardeners Hand Therapy (my wife had received a tube as a gift several years ago) right before bed each night.  I started doing this at night because I don't like the feel of any moisturizing product on my hands during the day.  Lo and behold - the painful cracks on my fingers stopped forming entirely, even though I had no moisturizer on them during waking hours!  And I didn't even have to be vigilant about keeping my nails super-short.  Fantastic product, and I like the unusual smell.  Thanks, C&E, for giving me my hands back during the cold New England winter.",5.0
I have hands that get very dry and sore in the winter and I've probably tried a dozen different hand creams that are supposed to help.  Even the prescription stuff that the Dermatologist prescribed didn't help.  But this stuff works the best of all of them. It's worth every penny.  I put it on at night and then a cotton glove that I got at the Dollar Tree for $1.00 and my hands are actually starting to improve.  Love this stuff!,5.0
"This has got to be the very best soap for gardeners!  It digs deep and gets rid of all sorts of grime. (I don't like to wear gloves!)
Came in house and bypassed the Crabtree and Evelyn soap for regular pump soap - couldn't understand why it was taking so long and so much work to get hands clean - the the light bulb went on and I realized I used the wrong soap!!
Hope they never stop making it!",5.0
"Fabulous soap.  Works well, smells wonderful, and lasts much longer than other liquid soaps.  I'm buying more.",5.0
LOVE this soap. Not only does it clean up my hands great after working in the garden but it also smells amazing! Definitely recommend it even though its a little pricey. My only complaint is that my container arrived dented.,5.0
My favorite soap! Makes hands feel so soft. Love the fragrance too! I would highly recommend it. I use it every day.,5.0
You can't go wrong with Crabtree and Evelyn products for yourself or as gifts. Hand soap is wonderful and I love the gardeners hand cream as well.,5.0
"I have Gardeners Liquid Hand Soap in every room with a sink.  It has a mild, pleasant fragrance that I enjoy.  It is not one of those soaps that you can smell on your hands from two feet away.  I have sensitive skin and normally use unscented products.  Surprisingly, this product works for me.  The soap comes in a metal container with 10.1 fluid ounces.  Crabtree & Evelyn started selling a refill again, which makes so much sense ecologically.  I just wish the ""value size"" were larger!  This time I found it cheaper to buy two regular size than one ""value size.""  When I reorder, that may not be the case.",5.0
"This is a great smelling liquid soap. I've been using it for years after finding the Gardener's hand cream - which is an excellent item - with a nice, not overly flowery smell.",5.0
"This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  When my hands are dry, I use a little before starting my knitting or crocheting.  Gave tubes of it to my daughters.",5.0
"It's thinner than the formula I normally like (O'Keeffe's working hands) but the scent of it. Sigh, I can apply and reapply, just for the smell alone.",5.0
"This is the best creme by far, I have stopped using all others! Makes your skin feel soooooo good! Like silk!",5.0
"A friend told me about this creme.  She let my try it and I loved it.  I couldn't wait to get home to see if Amazon carried this body lotion.
It's not greasy and the smell is pleasant.",5.0
I Found this product about 3 years ago and really like the consistency.  Great product to carry in your bag.,5.0
Love this product.  I keep a tube in my purse & one in my desk @ work...absorbs quickly & does not leave a greasy residue on my keyboard.,5.0
"I have used the Soy Milk Hand Cream from Archipelago Botanicals for years.  I love the light fragrance and the way it feels on my skin.  There is never an oily feel, your hands feel smooth and soft.  I will never buy another hand cream as long as Archipelago Botanicals continues to make this product.  I highly recommend it.",5.0
Best hand and cuticle cream for in the world! Buy 2 and keep one in your purse. Very mild pleasant scent.,5.0
"I cannot say enough good about this product, I just love everything about it. Just wish I could purchase it locally. Thanks so much.",5.0
"I use it as a face moisturizer...a little dab will do you and it is not greasy, soaks right in and smell is nice. Have used it for several years and try not to run out.....ever!",5.0
As a nurse who washes her hands frequently this is the best lotion. Has a mild aroma and doesn't leave your hands greasy or oily feeling. Easy to put gloves on right after application if needed.,5.0

It was a treat for my bday!",5.0
"I love this hand cream. It has a nice light scent, and it soaks in really smoothly.",5.0
"After more than 7 years of living in Florida, I had forgotten how dry the winters were in my home state of Ohio. I tried several hand creams to prevent my hands from cracking and becoming rough, including some of the lotions provided in my hospital, but nothing really worked. I am a male who enjoys a lot of time outdoors and I have to wash and sanitize my hands often for work, so my hands take a beating in northern winters.

I had been given a tube of this hand cream a few years ago while still in Florida, but decided to give it a try in Ohio. I am very glad I did!

So often hand creams and lotions are too perfume-y and not something most men would like to have to smell all day long. The scent of this hand cream is light, clean, and non-offensive or bothersome. It's not what I'd consider feminine, either...it's just right.

One does not need to use a lot, either, so even though the cream is a bit on the pricey side, a tube will last me an entire winter. It's a pretty rich consistency, so about a quarter to 3/8 of an inch of cream is more than plenty to rehydrate. It absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.

You can bet I'll get another tube come next winter!",5.0
Love how those lotion comes in a toothpaste type tube! The smell is light but clean. Wonderful for my dry hands. I'm going to buy the mint next.,5.0

"Smells great, works great.",5.0
Love this cream wish it was still sold in stores near me. Not greased and leaves my hands soft and moisturizer,5.0
So thankful a friend hipped me to this hand cream!  I carry a tube in my purse at all times!  It smells wonderful and absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue.  I work in optics and am always handing eyeglasses.  The last thing I need at work is greasy hands!  My husband also likes this product.,5.0
I first tried this as a sample in a store.  I was so impressed with the silky feel that I found it immediately on Amazon and bought it.  I love this hand crme and will buy it again.  The best word I know to describe the feel of my hands when I use this crme is silky.,5.0
The only thing that works on my dry overworked hands. The smell is divine.,5.0
"I am ordering this for the 3rd time from Amazon, though I'll pick it up at a shop if I see it available for sale. It never leaves my wish list - ever. I use the body wash, I have the giant pump bottle for body and this hand cream is practically with me everywhere I go. I found it over a decade ago at an Ulta store and fell in love. It has the most delicate fragrance - not overpowering, not the usual sickly perfume-y aroma that most hand creams tend to have - it's mild and smells like... I don't know. Like, ""soft"" if soft had a scent. AND it has NEVER made my hands sticky. That right there is the major selling point for me along with how little you need to use. I am constantly washing my hands, so I have to moisturize a lot. I'm not always great about it, but when I do, a quick dime sized dab and good to go. I know some people may balk at the price, but it is so worth for me. I last purchased this in August of 2015 and I am almost out if that gives you any indicator of how long this lasts with moderate use.",5.0
The best product.  It leaves my skin so smooth with no greasy or oily feel.  I have given it many times as gifts and I always have to keep extra tubes on hand so I do not run out.,5.0
Cleanest smelling lotion and best feeling that I have ever ever used.,5.0

great stuff! Working at a hospital I'm constantly washing my hands or using the antibacterial foam so my hands tend to dry out.  This lotion is light and moisturizes without leaving my hands feeling greasy.,5.0
The best!,5.0
"For whatever reason I bought a tube for my wife and ended up receiving two.  I do that sometimes...forgetting to look at the quantity in the cart before hitting the payment button.  So I threw the spare tube in my pocket and took it to work.  My workplace is like the Gobi Desert in heating season, so I ended up trying it out.  I was impressed by the quality of the product, the fact that it doesn't leave a greasy feel afterward, and smells like my first girlfriend in 7th grade.  I would give her a lift on my bike, perched on the handlebars with her hair in my face.  The smell was awesome and quite intoxicating as I rode her home.  She dumped me for the football team captain.  That's ok, I've recovered.  I had my moment of olfactory bliss, and I can have it again with Archipelago Botanicals Soy Milk Hand Cream No. 3.  The only rough spot in this transaction is the description on the Amazon blurb clearly states ""hand cream"" while the back of the tube reads ""Body Creme"" (sic).  My hands didn't know the difference.",5.0
SOOOO not worth the money. Packaging is aweful. Screw top way too small and this is hand cream not paint. Felt greasy although the review said it would not. Disappointed.,1.0
This smells like mens cologne. I thought it would smell more feminine disappointed.,1.0
"Maybe Im just not familiar with this brand, but if this is the type of fragrance they normally use...blech!  It might be a good cream but I had to wash my hands immediately (twice) to get the horrible smell off my hands so I couldn't tell.",1.0

"I used to love this lotion. It's one of the few that actually does what it says it will do. My issue with it is that Crabtree and Evelyn use palm oil in it, which I didn't realize until I read the product label the other day. And for those of you out there who don't know what the big deal is about, google palm oil plantations and the effects they have on local wildlife. It's horrifying to see what these plantations do to orangutans, tigers, etc-the farmers completely destroy the natural habitat so they can sell us cheap palm oil to use in our products. I'm boycotting Crabtree and Evelyn until they remove this from their products. I won't buy a product knowing that doing so is destroying the earth.",1.0
Bottle arrived dented. No packing slip. $30 way too expensive for 8 ounces. Sorry I bought it,1.0
Crabtree & Evelyn is supposed to be a fantastic brand of lotion. However with as active as I am I found that it didn't provide enough moisture for my hands. I have found other products since then that work better.,1.0
"I bought this cream in hope to save my dry cracked hands. The whole tube lasted me one week and I used about 5-8 times a day. My hands still dry and cracked  , no improvement at all. Will not buy again.",1.0

"This was for my sister. No instructions on how to use it. She had purchased this a few years ago; thought she was getting the similar thing. Everything was in French.  Very disappointed in what she received. A waste of money.

Can was dented. For 30.00 a bottle for lotion you do not expect a dented can. I will keep it because it is too much time and money to send it back. Im glad I did not purchase this as a gift because I would be ashamed to give it with the dents. What a shame and a bad reflection on the Crabtree and Evelyn name. Next time I will order it from the original store where it costs the same. Live and Learn.,1.0
these smell funny. I am not sure they are authentic.,1.0

"I wasn't a real big fan of this product. I'm big on whitening my teeth, and I thought the powder mixture combined with the whiten teeth and get fresh breath all in one would end up being a favorite, but that wasn't the case. Actually using it wasn't so bad, but it made my teeth feel really grimy afterwards. I would actually brush my teeth to try to get rid of the feeling after I was done using it, because I couldn't stand what my teeth felt like. Not one I would recommend.
I received this product in my monthly Birchbox.",1.0
"Disappointed in this product. Doesn't mix well, gritty. Like rinsing with sandy water. Awful taste!",1.0
It absolutely did not work at all.  No change in my teeth after even a month's worth of using it twice a day.  I feel it was misrepresented.  I should have saved my money.,1.0

"This product doesnt work. I fell in love with the narrative about the good dentist founder but sadly it doesnt work. Will not restore porcelain restorations to original whiteness. I called company, well-trained customer service will be really nice to you acts concerned and surprised as they then encourage you to buy extra whitening sticks to supplement the whitening power of their pricey toothpaste. Sadly the whitening sticks/ rods  also don't  work. Crest whitening strips w/ supreme flex fit works well for me, none of the other crest strips are effective for me, and this stuff doesnt work at all. I wish Id demanded a refund.",1.0
I am so disappointed with this product. I used it until it was finished and I saw absolutely no change to the shade of my teeth. Waste of money.,1.0
This toothpaste didn't whiten my teeth any whiter than other whitening toothpastes.,1.0

don't waste your money. did not notice a difference.,1.0
"Doesn't work well at all, and I use a rotary electric toothbrush. The price made me believe reviews that this would whiten bonding on teeth that turned yellow. It does nothing like one reviewer said. It gets dry, maybe because abrasives in it to whiten are there but I don't know, and does not do any better than regular cheap toothpaste to whiten. I don't recommend wasting your money on this at all.",1.0

Do NOT BUY THE SYSTEM PEOPLE I HAD TO CANCEL MY ACCOUNT WITH THEM TODAY...IT'S A SCAM THE TOOTHPASTE IS GOOD BUT BUYING FROM THEM is no Bueno I regret I watched that stupid tv commercial and now they took $240.50 for two boxes that I purchased... I'm not mad or anything... I work for my $$ and I was stupid not to spend it wisely... well I took it as a life lesson...my husband is in the military I wanted to send him one his teeth are like a 8 and mine like a 7... I still got to keep both boxes but I had to pay 99.80 and they already took $149.70 total 240.5 so yeah now I know not to trust people with my $,1.0

I used the system for 30 days with no results or improvemsnts in the whiteness of my teeth..  I bought the 30 day supply then found out that they automatically sign you up for a 90 supply.

"I have used the green apple flavor about 4 times so far and it is horrible. It seems they were going for a sour Jolly Rancher flavor, but the overwhelming flavor is bitter saccharine.  Additionally, it makes noxious fumes as you brush: every time I have used it I have had a coughing fit in the middle of brushing; hubby used it twice with the same results.  I don't know what is causing the coughing but I know it's not good. Into the trash it goes.",1.0
"My boyfriend said I smelled like rotten apples and trash when I brushed with this and kept me ten feet away. It also arrived sealed yet only half full, so I suspect it is not a full 4.2 ounces at all but more like 1.7 I love supersmile but this flavor is super gross.",1.0
"I am so sorry that I wasted my money on this product. My grandson, my husband and myself have all been using this product, along with the accelerator; however, they don't work. All our teeth have remained the same. I have wasted so much money on various sites

"I anm in an industry that requires me to look presentable. Hair, clothes, teeth. This product does NOTHING - Do Not Buy! Get crest white strips and toothpaste/mouth rinse. That is all you need. This product is a JOKE! Just get the OTC and you will be happy!",1.0
"I was not at all pleased with Supersmile. I saw no difference whatsoever in the color of my teeth. I ordered by phone, and was not told that the 30 day supply came with an automatic shipment in 30 days for a 90 day supply and a charge to my card of over $114. When I called to protest, I was told that if I had ordered through their website, I would've seen the details of the 30 day offer. Well excuse me for ordering by phone. I threatened to contact the AG--that's when the operator told me to do what I need to do and hung up on me. I don't trust this company and would not recommend it to anyone.

Absolutely not worth it. The product did not whiten my teeth after almost 3 months of using it religiously. I followed the instructions step by step so I can honestly say it simply does as much or less than any regular whitening toothpaste. AVOID.,1.0
"I noticed no difference in the whitening of my teeth and didn't like the consistence of the paste. On the up side, it did no harm.",1.0
"If I could give this product no stars I would. I used a pea size amount of the accelerator and the same of the toothpaste and, as directed, brushed for two minutes.  After only one use, it's going back.  It burned my gums so badly that one hour later they are still white, like the color has been drained out of them.  I won't be giving this product a fair shot at whitening, I realize, but I don't believe that the seller of the product is informing the public of the damage that it can wreak on one's gums... Not worth it!!",1.0
I happened to start using this toothpaste and accelerator the day before my semi-annual cleaning.  When my dentist saw my gums she asked me what in the world I had done to burn them.  I had the product with me and she told me to immediately stop using it.  She read the ingredients and then laughed at the claims to whiten teeth.  Don't waste your money!!!,1.0
Feel like I've been ripped off and the Dentist Inventor is laughing all the way to the bank.  Been using it for a month with no difference in teeth.  He ought to be ashamed and put in jail for robbery.,1.0

This deodorant is no good at all. I have been trying to use it just because I paid for it. It does not last and you ate just paying for a name. If you are the type to sweat; don't bother getting this because it will not do the job of keeping you fresh. The other people wearing this must not get super sweaty because they sweat it works. Doesn't even smell like anything. You'll be musty within a few hours.,1.0

This deodorant is completely useless. I've already used half of it until I realized that it is completely useless. It doesn't smell completely like the spray. The scent is not strong at all.

Heats well however after a couple uses it has fallen apart! I purchased a Hot Tools hotcomb years ago and I had it for several years. Once it was worn out I purchased this flat iron and also another hot comb from hot tools and they both fell apart with just a few uses. Like I mentioned earlier they both heat very well and straighten my hair well however the play has fallen apart and this spring has fallen out. I would think this was due to wear and tear even though it's only been a few uses but for both of the tools to have done the same thing I'm very disappointed,1.0
Bad design. Kept pulling my hair,1.0
The cheaply made plastic handle made the way it closed very uneven. When it arrived it also did not work. I sent it back and because of the quality I will not order again.,1.0

"I originally bought the Helen of Troy flat iron several years ago and LOVED it. Would use it on the hottest temperature setting and it straightened my hair quickly. It lasted me several, several years until i accidentally damaged it with water. Then i did some research and realized that it changed names to Hot Tools. I purchased another iron from Amazon not too long ago. It was working great at first, then the hinge broke in between the two paddles (screw came out). I kept pushing it back in and it wouldn't stay, but kept using it anyway. Then the night of my nephews wedding I used it, and it must have been on it's last leg, because it died after i damaged the hell out of my hair. It singed my hair terribly before the wedding. So I decided to purchase another one since I figured it was a faulty iron. I purchased it last November. It has been working great until last night. I was straightening my hair, and mind you I do not straighten my hair everyday-- so it is not getting a whole lot of use-- and the hinge broke again!!! Would love to have given this product a good review, but Hot Tools needs to change how they manufacture their product.",1.0
Not the same kind I had previously.  It does not get very hot. It says it can get to 420 degrees and it doesn't.  I can hold my hair after you run the flat iron in it and it does t burn me.  I only use hot tools flat iron b/c I have very thick curly hair and the hottest temp straightens it really good but not this one that I got. Very disappointed!!!,1.0

"never was right since the day i opened it... this flat iron i wanted because i used a friends-often and loved it.  I have used other flat irons in the past and this was fast, sturdy and didn't fry my hair.

It was lighter, more plastic, just junk!!!!

"For the first few months after buying, it worked great.  It did pull my hair a little but I had that issue with other big straighteners.

This was the first I've ever bought off amazon instead of a major retailer.  Next time, I'll spend the few extra bucks at the major retailer and get a good product.",1.0
Very poor construction.  Pieces didn't fit tightly together.  Literally fell apart (into three pieces) after only two weeks.  In the garbage now and I'm on the hunt for another product.,1.0

"My last Hot Tools flat iron lasted for 15 YEARS of professional use. So, when it finally died recently I didn't hesitate to buy another. But, like everything else they don't make them like they used to. On about the tenth use, I turned it on to heat up and it made a popping sound, started to smoke and the handle melted. I had owned it for 35 days, (five days past Amazon's return policy) so I can't return it. I'm stuck sending it back to the manufacturer and paying shipping both ways. Boo!",1.0
"I was very excited to try this as nothing else is working for me for my new friend Rosacea.  It took a lot for me to put out the $85 but if it works then I can justify the price.  It actually made my condition worse.  I'm itchier, redder and blotchier than I was before I used it.  And I actually think I have real pimples now to boot!  So great!
I also made the mistake of putting it around my eyelids to help calm my ocular rosacea so now my eyes feel like they're bleeding.  It's so frustrating how one thing works for someone and is just pure evil tor another.
Still searching....",1.0
"This product, which was very expensive, did not calm, cool or correct my facial redness. It made it much worse.",1.0
"I got this because I had red dry patches in my ""t zone"" thinking this would ""calm and cool and correct it"" all it does is burn the heck out of it. I suggest not buying it.",1.0
Terrible product.  It spilled all over me and the floor.,1.0
Everyone saying how wonderful buy by day two my under arms had broken out in a painful red rash.  One of the reasons I bought it was comments it was great for sensitive skin.  I also felt dampness under my arms by afternoon.,1.0
"The most unhelpful product I ever ordered from Amazon.  The descriptions for the product ingredients are not as specific as they should be so one can't know what they are purchasing.  I ended up wasting $22 for a worthless product.  If you want lasting protection and no worries about putting more aluminum in/on your body, DO NOT buy this product!!!!",1.0
"Still produced a rash, just took longer. for the price, would not recommend!",1.0
Whyyyy not sydney!!!!!,1.0
"I bought this product based on reccomendations from a writer/blogger that has severe excessive under arm sweating issues, not unlike myself; I have purchased several products in the hopes that one or a combination of a few would stop the embaressing sweating! Long story short, I received the DERMA DOCTOR product, used it and it had ZERO effectiveness in reducing my under arm perspiration. Only AFTER using it for a week did I decide to read the back and discovered it's active ingredient is EXACTLY the same ingredient as the clinical strength Secret solid I already have, not only that but my SECRET clinical strength antiperspirant has 19% as where the Derma Doctor only has 11.25%! In addition, the SECRET clinical strength only cost me $7.00 dollars and the Derma Doctor was $20.00! Neither antiperspirant works for me but if you want to try an antiperspirant with this active ingredient to see if it may help for you buy the secret clinical strength at your local store and save yourself the $13.00 dollars difference in price!",1.0
It made me sweat more and didn't change the color of MY under arms. I don't shave my under arms every day and I apply St. Ives SCRUB and that has been working for me.,1.0
"However, it is more expensive. Not worth the extra money. I tried it, my husband tried it.... we really gave it a shot hoping it would work for us but alas...",1.0
Sad to report that this very promising product turned out to be nothing more than very disappointing. No whitening at all and I had used it for several months.,1.0
"I've had KP since I was about 12 (I'm 28 now) and I recently tried KP Duty. I am absolutely *shocked* that a product that makes such brazen claims can be so ineffective.  The bottle actually has a cartoon CHICKEN on it, says it ""Effectively eliminates"" the bumps, and that ""Flawless"" skin is achievable.

  I have KP all over my legs; most of it is not inflamed, but there are a couple patches that are reddened.  I also have very fair skin (transparent, basically) and the KP looks bad enough that no one has seen my legs at all since I was 12.  (Insert complete social isolation and low self esteem HERE !)  So I was so happy to see that this ""KP Duty"" product was formulated specifically for this disease, and I really thought it would work.  Well, I've used it once a day for a month now and have noticed no reduction in the bumps or the red spots or the redness generally.  The skin does *feel* much softer, but it's as ugly as ever, and the bumps are obvious when you look at the skin in profile.

  I have no clue how long you're supposed to use this product before you see results.  They say you should try any new skin product for at least 6 weeks before you give up, so I think I will keep at it for a while longer.  But I'm assuming now that all of the raving reviews this product gets are due to its skin-softening effect, not ANY actual treatment of KP.  As Jay mentioned, any lotion can provide softer skin without the $35 price !!

  I have noticed within the past week or so that the ankle/calf region has started peeling.  I hope this is a good thing (exfoliation?) and maybe if it continues there could be some better skin revealed underneath.  However, so far even the peeling areas still have red, KP spots!

  Will post another review here if the product does turn out to be effective, but don't hold your breath, folks.",1.0
Didn't help at all with my child's keratosis Pilaris,1.0
This product is super expensive and I saw zero results. Look further.,1.0
"This product was recommended from my dermatologist and have using it for months and have not seen any results with my keratosis P (chicken bumps). I have seen more severe than mine, so I tried a couple at home remedies that were more effective (check out sour cream and sugar, olive oil, etc.)  Also used gylolic  acid cream and peels which seems to be helping as well. So don't give up and if you don't have the money for this or decide to use it anyways after reading this and doesn't work either, don't give up.  Google it and you will find something that works.",1.0
My arms have light keratosis pilaris and this really didn't do anything for me. The smell was unpleasant so it was also unbearable to apply this to my skin.,1.0
"didn't really do anything for me, even when used as stated in the directions",1.0
Did not make a difference in my daughters KP at all.,1.0
Does not take away my dry skin bumps like it says it will.,1.0
"I have suffered from this ""chicken skin"" on my upper arms for about 5 years. A few months back I purchased KP Duty based on the great reviews.
I was a bit of a skeptic so decided to use it only on my left arm and continue to use my Target brand $5 lotion on my right.
4 months later and there is nothing different about either arm. They both look the same.
Save your $40.",1.0
Used this once and it made my daughter's KP possibly the worst I've ever seen it. I want my money back. $40 for something I'll never be able to use.,1.0
It didn't help at all; my skin got worse!!!,1.0
"doesnt do anything, better off exfoliating and using natural oils",1.0
Didn't work. It wants you to use their complete system. This also lasts for a few weeks. Terrible product. Do not buy.,1.0
"while lighter and more convenient that the other KP regimen, it did not work as well as the other one.",1.0
"I'm so disappointed at this product. My skin is still the same. Just waste my money,waste my time and it gave me a fake hope.",1.0
been using it for a month and i don't see a difference. i don't like it. maybe ill try buying some more,1.0
"I thought at least the redness or the bumps were gonna disappear but no 3 months later my arms look the same, I'm didn't use only the lotion moisturizing but the scrub and serum as well not even because I was using it daily, I'm seriously very sad about the results",1.0
"Product does NOT work.  Tried the product for 2 full wks as instructed, nothing changed.  Money spent was a total waste.",1.0
"I was so disappointed in this product. From what I saw on the Dermadoctor website, it gave me hope and it has such a cute package, plus I felt like this doctor knows what she's talking about. But I used it religiously, the whole tube, and it did absolutely nothing for my KP. I felt like a loser for spending all this money on something called KP Duty that didn't work at all. I think my bumps looked a bit worse, actually, to add insult to injury. Learn from my mistake, and if you have KP, keep looking (I'm still looking for something that works!)",1.0
"I was dissapointed in this product.  It was not effective at all on my daughter's skin.  Worse, if she had even the tiniest little scratch, the product would burn so badly that I had to wash it off.

I submitted a review for this product on the manufacturer's website.  They sent me a nice apology note, but they did not post my review.  I'm just trying to stop other people from being suckered in to buying this product.",1.0
"I very much wanted this product to work.  I read reviews from the Dermadoctor website and it seemed like a miracle product/cure for ""chicken skin"".  I used the entire tube as directed and noticed no difference in my skin or any improvement whatsoever.  I'm very disappointed and won't buy this product again.",1.0
This product claims a lot and does little.  It hasn't helped my KP at all infact I think it maybe getting worse.  I have been using it for a month twice a day and nothing has changed since I started.  What a waste of money.  I hope I can find something to help the KP on my arms before my wedding.,1.0
"Not only is this product over-hyped and overpriced - but Dermadoctor website publishes only reviews with glowing comments about it!  Which I did not find out until I read those glowing reviews, wasted my own money and time on this product and then posted a negative review at their site - which never showed up there!  Aha, I thought, now I see their game - never will buy a single thing from them again.... Maybe it works for some - but who can know what the real results are when they don't publish both the good and the BAD reviews.",1.0
Don't waste your money. This product made the bumps on my arms even redder. I tried it for several weeks thinking it would eventually get better. The redness went away after I stopped using it and I'm back to square one.,1.0

NOT for short hair.  Big mistake,1.0
"I'm not even sure this is useable.  There is no where to hold with your other hand.  There is absolutely no tension in the handle.  If this is made for a professional, they must be amazing!!!  Because I tried 1 curl and decided, never will I touch this thing again!!!!",1.0
I don't understand why every time I order these irons. It stops getting hot and I don't understand why. I need to speak to someone about this because this is the third iron I got that just stops working.,1.0
I bought this iron got it in the mail today plugged it in and it started SMOKING!! and it smells like it has a hot wire. I'm returning it immediately.,1.0
VERY hard to use. Returned the next day.,1.0
I am highly dissatisfied with this product. It is very difficult to use and is no different than any other curling iron. This iron is very unstable which makes it so easy to burn yourself on it. I would never repurchase this or suggest it to anyone.,1.0
I don't like this iron. Very cumbersome to use. If I had the box I would return. Waste of money.,1.0
Couldn't' master it...gave it away. Not good for someone with arthritis.,1.0
Dislike. The clamp doesn't have a spring to help grab hair so you have to use your hand and fingers to clamp it down. The clamp also leaves a crease on your hair ... I have it on the lowest heat setting so too much heat isn't the issue.  Would not buy again,1.0
"It stopped working within 2 months of using it!!! In the past this product would last for years. I will never purchase this from AMAZON again. Of course, now the window of returning it has closed. FRUSTRATED!!!",1.0
This was flimsy. The spring was also very loose. I was unable to get a decent curl out of the tool. I returned this and got one at Sally's. It's much better quality.,1.0
Did not hold a curl at all. Very disappointed.,1.0
"This curling iron is amazing at first and I have purchased several over the last 16 years but the last 5 (yes 5!) have gotten a short in the cord, some of them less than a couple months old. There is nothing more embarrassing than holding your cord in a certain position trying to make the light stay on while finishing a client. I don't think I should have to go out every few months for a new one but it is the only marcel I can get locally in a hurry.  Something has to change. Shopping online for a new brand :(",1.0
How in the world does anyone use this thing without burning themselves!  Ouch!,1.0
"Horrible curling iron. Its very awkward to use, not your clamp and curl iron everyone is used to.  I returned this product immediately for a full refund.  If I could I would give zero stars!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!",1.0

"First of all this thing gets hot, which is a good thing, until it burns the crap out of your face! I literally have a penny round burn mark on my face. There's nothing to hold the other end, just the iron itself. Not to mention it is very hard to use! It's not like your regular curling iron clamp. This one is really loose and is just very hard to work. I ended up giving it away.",1.0
I accidently bought the professional tool and I was physically unable to use it.  I had to sent it back.,1.0
"This item stopped working about 6months after I received it.  I purchased another one larger barrel and seems to be working fine, just very disappointed only worked for 6 months or less.",1.0
Incredible hard to use. I watched several tutorials but it was still not an easy use.,1.0
"I'm not sure if it was put in the description of this curling iron, but this is very hard to work with.  There isn't a clamp to hold your hair, you have to somehow hold/maneuver the lever/clamp manually.  I haven't even attempted to try this one because I know I will burn myself with it.  Since I took it out of the box I can't exactly return it so I think I will pry the clamp off and give it to my daughter to use it as a wand (?)",1.0
"This curling iron lasted about 5 minutes, before it stopped heating up.  I will not recommend this product or company to anyone.",1.0
"Very unwieldy to use.  Seems like it is broken, but hard to tell. I accidentally ripped the box opening it and so can't return it.  Very disappointed.",1.0
I bought this product with great hope because of the reviews rating. I had been using for one month now. But it does nothing to my pore. My pore is still large as it is.,1.0
"I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel.

Doesnt match the regular color of the real product. Suspect its a Knick off.,1.0

I figured that the problem must have been remedied since those reviews were posted, so I chose to order anyway. But there is something wrong with the product I received. For one, it's very thin and doesn't cover well at all. But it also gets gooey very fast in the bottle, so I have to shake the bottle constantly. And it chips easily, within 24-48 hours multiple nails are chipped and I have to make repairs. At 3-4 days it's peeling off. On top of that, it arrived with polish spilled out onto the outside of the bottle. Something isn't right here.",1.0
"This was the worst nail polish I have ever used (and I have used OPI for years).... Even when applied by a pro nail tech, it smeared and streaked and basically rubbed off....

My mother loved my polish Shorts Story, so I thought Id purchase a bottle as a gift. I would have purchased it from my nail technician but she didn't have any in supply, just the bottle I use. I received it today. Im highly disappointed & quite frankly, angry. It applies like a cheap polish from a dollar store! The emblem on the front matches none of my OPI bottles, & I own quite a few. I would send it back but I highly doubt this company would have the integrity & wherewithal to refund me.",1.0
The product is old had to throw away,1.0
I'm sorry but did I get a dud? I used this polish as soon as I got it. It started chipping the next day. I took all the nail polish off a few days later and applied a heavier coat to have the exact same thing happen. The polish itself looks like white out when it dried. This is not something i've ever had an issue with when buying opi directly from salons! The picture I'm including is 1 day and 4 hours after applying.,1.0

This is NOT OPI,1.0
"I bought OPI in Alpine Snow from Amazon.com Services, Inc.  I thought it would be safe to buy from Amazon but the product I received was definitely a FAKE OPI product.

This tasted SO BAD!!!! I barely tasted the bubble gum. Yuck!,1.0
No like.,1.0
"Not the same color, bottle, or quality of previously purchased OPI polish in the same color.  You can see in the photos this bottle is darker and not as soft pink as the original.  Also, unless they changed their packaging its not the same product.",1.0
I had this color put in in the nail salon and loved it so much I bought this. This is NOT OPI quality. Im not sure if its a fake or what but its so watery and thin I had to put four coats to cover my nail. Either I got an old/bad bottle or this is fake OPI,1.0
"*update*
Not sure if this was a knock off (Im seeing others post comparison photos, and Ive never bought this brand before I did however go to Sallys and the bottle is different!) but this polish has destroyed my nails. They are peeling, brittle and just awful. Never have my nails received this amount of damage from any polish. Will never buy cosmetics through amazon again as there are too many fakes being sold, and too many fake reviews to back them up. Pretty sure this was right through amazon, not a third party seller.

Purchased dulce de leche for a wedding. I thought the color was pretty hideous, but the naipolish itself held up well. I took it to a salon and they gave me a manicure. If you're using base/top coats make sure you use Opi brand as others didn't work with it. Held up for the 3 days i needed it to, without any cracking or chipping. I doubt Ill ever use it again. Im just glad we didn't have open toe shoes. 10 nails exposing this color was enough. Lol. (It wasn't just me. Even the manicurist said it was awful!)",1.0
Samoan Sand- I just got this in the mail and its totally fake. The packaging is definitely NOT the original OPI bottle and there was no sticker on the bottom of the bottle with the barcode and name of polish. Save your money!,1.0
I gota fake one what the hell.... As did other girls.. Should've looked at all the picture reviews before purchasing... I am not happy,1.0

Also, the color is nothing compared to the one I'm used to wearing from my hair salon, this one is more watery and transparent. I'm very disappointed with my purchase. To make things worse, Amazon's CS does not want to be held accountable for a product I bought directly from them.",1.0

I just received my bottle today but unfortunately I was one of the unlucky shoppers who received a counterfeit bottle.

The bottle design looKs completely different and the polish color is darker than the authentic one. Buyer be warned,1.0
"The bottle I received is a cheap knock off, NOT a real OPI bottle. I have a bottle of the real (store bought) Youre Such a Budapest and this is not the same product at all. See: my pictures, bottle on the left is real and bottle on the right is what this seller sent me. The labels on the bottle are completely different and the polish itself is watery garbage and definitely not worth spending $10. The color isn't even a dupe to the real version; the real YSAB is a subdued periwinkle color whereas the fake is a more childish and bright lavender. I wouldnt buy this crap from the drugstore for $2.",1.0
"Too light, 3 coats didn't cover my imperfections. Probably god for young children",1.0

I have Nomads Dream and was running low.  Instead of getting the mauve-tan with the irredescent green tone like the original I received a tan shade with no irredescence.  The bottle was a very close resemblance but a tad different.  This is the second bottle Ive purchased online.  The first was a color Ive never used before but oddly the polished chipped after 3 days like drug store polish instead of staying on for 2 weeks like OPI normally does on me.  Not worth buying online anymore because I think its fake.,1.0
toucan do it if you try is the color i purchased and it is a nice muted coral in the photo. this is a neon pink orange and not even close. i won't be buying nail polish online anymore,1.0

"I would give it negative stars if there was such an option. The one sent to me was a fake one you can tell by the look, watery and smells horrible, and it won't dry! Stay away from this, read other negative reviews with pictures that show you the comparison of this fake one and a real OPI.",1.0

"I received the Mod about you color. The quality of the nail polish was extremely poor. I believe this company is selling dupes because the quality was subpar to the real nail polish.

"Yes, my SKIN! It stained my skin when I used the nail polish remover. I just removed it and realized my fingers were smeared with the color and I can't get it off. Check out the pictures. After rubbing my skin for 10 mins with nail polish remover, I gave up so to not completely dry and ruin my skin any further.

There is something seriously wrong with this product. Stay away.",1.0

This seems to be fake OPI. I gave it 4 stars on account of it looks and works exactly the same as Samoan Sand but the writing does not look like OPI. I hope it works out the same as the regular OPI in the end otherwise $10 is steep for off brand nail polish.  UPDATE: THIS IS TERRIBLE!!! I feel like asking for my money back. It's all chunky and even drugstore nailpolishes work better than this. Look somewhere else.,1.0

This polish is not as it appears ...very pinky silver and dated looking...most disappointing.  Also I could have sworn when I ordered the polish Amazon said I could return it but now it says I cannot??  I'm noticing you really have to look closely AFTER items are in cart.  Some of my prime noted items did not arrive quickly others I even canceled due to delays...  ??  Love OPI as a product just disappointed the color is not as it is described or pictured,1.0
"The color does not like the picture shows
Want to return it but amazon rufused",1.0
"I have used OPI before and have had good results; however, this bottle was very thick and gooey as if it had been dried out.  The color started to chip within hours of painting my nails. I think I received a very old bottle of polish which is a shame because it was an expensive one-time use.",1.0
It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.,1.0
Light colors are streaky and so is this one. Through it out after first five coats were unsuccessful.,1.0
Its fake!,1.0
"Very disappointed, put it on and one can't even tell if I'm wearing polish or not. The color is not light, it's translucent, see through, and that you do, see right through it, down to the nails.
I have a lot of OPI nail colors, and this one I recommend you pass it by.  Came packed well, if not over packed, it was wrapped so tightly it took over 10 minutes to get all the wrappings off. Was excited to see the color, just doesn't look like this on one's nails.  Too Bad!!
It's a shame some colors just aren't what they seem, I would have loved this color on my nails.  Shame on OPI",1.0
"Interesting name
Applies poorly
I would NOT RECOMMEND",1.0
"Beware, this is a knock off. The logo on my bottle looks completely different than my other OPI bottles.. will be returning.",1.0
"I usually like all of OPI polishes. There was nothing wrong with the consistency of the polish and it went on smoothly...it was just the ugliest color I have ever seen painted on my nails. It may be my skintone, but it looked tacky and I hated it.",1.0
Pretty sure this fake OPI,1.0
Nail polish was thick and glopped (is that a word?) on in streaks.  Probably old or damaged.  Won't buy from this vendor again.,1.0
"I bought 3 colors: Step Right Up, Samoan Sand and Alpine snow. The Alpine snow worked well for French Manicures. The other two are pretty color's but almost impossible to apply evenly.  When I first opened the bottles the polish was thin and streaked but before I finished the first coat on all my nails it started to thicken.  By the time I finished the second coat it was gloppy and unusable!  I haven't used OPI in quite a while so maybe they changed the formula?  It used to be great polish. I won't be buying again.",1.0
"Product streaks when applied, even second coat and I use OPI base coat.  Also this particular bottle has little black flecks in polish.  Need to send this back to Amazon, but not sure how to do it yet",1.0
This nail polish was sealed closed so tight as if it had already had paint around the bottle. It was already goopy when I opened it. Poor quality!,1.0
Ordered a cream pink and received a bubblegum pink almost the same exact color I ordered previously. Was not happy at all.,1.0
"This color is not the color I have been using for years. It is labeled as ""Passion"" but not the same color. Very disappointed",1.0
not what I expected. does not look like the color I got. the color I got is darker than this picture. not impress with the customer service I got about this.,1.0
Horrible gunky formula! So thick and uneven. No glossy finish. This polish does not feel or look like OPI.,1.0
I love OPI but this particular polish comes out very thick and clumpy. It streaked so bad that I had to remove it immediately. I would like to return this but it is not returnable.  Wish I never bought it.,1.0
I was very disappointed upon receiving my nail polis as it was 2/3 full.  1/3had already been used out of the bottle!!!! Not happy at all!,1.0
Not as expected,1.0
"Beware, I received a rip-off as well. Easy to tell... font and text on the bottle was different than genuine OPI nail polishes. Another easy way to tell is the sticker on the bottom of a genuine OPI bottle has an option to ""peel here"" option that will display the name of the nail polish instead of the barcode.",1.0
polish I received was old and sticky.,1.0
Counterfeit item!! Labeling is way off compared to all my OPI products purchased in stores. Will be returning.,1.0
This is not OPI polish. The bottle looks different and the color is not the same as the real OPI color. I'm very disappointed to have paid more for this that I would at the store only to find it's not even the real color. The bottle also has little chips in it which has never happened with my opi bottles. Even after I've dropped them.,1.0
Received busted up inside package,1.0
"Last week, I purchased four OPI nai lacquers through this Amazon listing (Passion, Funny Bunny, Rosy Future, and Mimosas for Mr. and Mrs.). Amazon, not a third party seller, was the distributor of all four. Every single one was obviously counterfeit.

The text on all four of the bottles was applied crookedly and in uneven ink. The font and text on the front of three bottles is totally different from any font and text used on any OPI nail lacquer, current or past.  I still own well-cared-for OPI polishes I bought more than a decade ago, so I can compare easily!

Passion and Rosy Future look nothing like the bottles I've purchased from authorized sellers (salons and beauty supply stores). Seriously, Passion is not supposed to be a cool toned bubble gum pink that is thick in texture and opaque in two coats. Funny Bunny is a chalky, nearly opaque white (Alpine Snow, anyone?). Rosy Future and Mimosas do seem nearly normal in the bottle, but Mimosas is a nasty, sheer beige when applied, even after multiple coats - zero pink or peach.

Luckily, Amazon refunded all four in under eight hours after I explained the problems in detail. The ease and speed of the refund process makes me wonder if Amazon knowingly and willingly sells bogus cosmetics but prefers to settle with the consumer rather than encumber legal issues.  Lesson learned: buy from a reputable authorized seller outside of Amazon for the real McCoy.",1.0
I love the color but the polish is so thick and globby it's impossible to not get air bubbles while painting so it ends up looking terrible. Normally polish will get thicker after multiple uses but this happened the first time I used it.,1.0
"This is a fake product. The logo is totally wrong. Also, the authentic product should have OPI logo molded into the shaft of the brush. This isn't even a decent fake!",1.0
"Rip off. I buy all of my OPI polish from beauty supply shops - clearly that's where I need to continue getting it. Top row are all true legitimate OPI polishes. The blue is what I got from this seller. Clearly a fake & regardless of wear, I'm pissed I spent the money for OPI and got this.",1.0
"Hate the color, ugly, ugly, ugly. However, the seller was quick and no problem whatsoever.  I would buy from this seller again.",1.0

"This review is for Russian Navy. Nice color, but when you remove it, it's a real mess, it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails, the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess, discolors your natural nails too. Awful! I have it away from my other polishes to be sure I don't use it again. I had to refile my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off, I wanted to cry. I use a base coat too so this isn't the case. I love opi, but they can keep this, not sure what there doing, I hope it's just this color and they haven't changed the formula, I do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal",1.0
"The description said it was streak-free, but this was far from true in my experience, regardless of what I did. I guess I'm not good at putting on nail polish, or something.",1.0
"This is definitely a fake OPI nail polish.  The bottle is slightly different, font is not the same and wording is not the same as other authentic bottles.  Really disappointed",1.0
RECIEVED A FAKE!!!! Not authentic OPI. Bottle was nothing like original OPI bottles and polish was watery and thin.,1.0
"I received a knock off bottle of It's in the Cloud. On the left is a real bottle that I've had for a while, on the right is the bottle I received from Amazon. OPI's label has never looked like that.  I'm so disappointed!",1.0
The color shown here is darker ...toucan do it is bright orange!,1.0
"The print of a product can tell the authencity of it. Please see the pictures of the comparison of the product I got.  Let's see the details:
1. The line is missing. There are 2 lines in total, but the blue nail polish only has one.
2. The order of the addresses should be company's address, then the manufacturer's address. But the blue one has the manufacturer's address first. This doesn't make sense on a business perspective.
3. The class labes are much smaller, the flamerble, shelf life etc,.
4. The color is off. You can argue with that. But
I don't dare to try this nail polish.
The middle one is also from the same seller, but it looks better. But the blue one makes me think that the middle one could be not authentic as well. You can't return the items. Please be aware you might get the same one as mine.",1.0
Color was SUPER sheer and horrible. What a waste of money. I usually love OPI but this was just terrible.,1.0
Waste of money. Someone totally added water to it and resold it. Wasn't even sealed or anything.,1.0
Terrible! Wore off in one day. Must have been very old. Threw it away.,1.0
Not what it looks like,1.0
This is a knock off nail polish. It looks nothing like the picture and is sent in a fake opi bottle. Do not buy this!!! It is non-refundable. I would give it negative stars if I could!,1.0
Hate it. It's a frosty pink color,1.0
This is not Back to the Beach Peach.  This is very misleading.,1.0
"It had a pinkish tint.  I compared to another bottle I had if the same color and it was clearly not the same.  I love OPI polish and Bubble Bath is my favorite shade for my hands, but I was disappointed the bottle I received with that name on it was not the color it was supposed to be.",1.0
"I think this is counterfeit.  The label is completely different than any other OPI bottle I've seen, but, more importantly, the color is not ""bubble bath"".  It is much pinker and I've compared it to fresh, unopened bottles at other retailers as well as opened bottles at salons.  Buyer beware!!!",1.0
"I thought this would be a great nude for my hands, but it isn't yellow enough,and is instead too sheer and an oatmeal/beige color. Ended up giving it away. Dissappointed",1.0
Wonderful,1.0
"I want to return this. I had just used OPi's Princesses Rule on my nails last week. Loved it so much I wanted to order it online. Turns out, OPI changed the formula! Beware~ if you think this will be the shimmery silver with just a tiny hint of blush polish you will be sadly mistaken.",1.0
Disappointed,1.0
I believe to have received a fake product.,1.0
Inauthentic OPI product.  See pictures of bottle I received (left) compared to an authentic bottle of OPI nail polish that I purchased at a salon (picture on right).,1.0
"Pretty positive this ""It's a Boy!"" color is an OPI knockoff. In my attached picture, you can see an example of a ""real"" OPI polish (green, purchased from Sally Beauty Supply, an official OPI seller) next to what I received from this vendor (blue). The font on the bottle is completely different as is the bottle itself and the brush. Held next to the computer screen, you can see that what I received does not even match the bottle shown on the web page. Very disappointed, and will never purchase from this vendor again.",1.0
"I have used this color at salons for some time.  Despite thoroughly mixing the polish, it went on very streaky from the bottle I ordered.  (Also the other color I ordered did the same.). I can only assume since my salons don't have a problem with it either the polish was a different product in an OPI bottle, or it was very OLD, which I suspect.  Made several attempts and same result each time. Since both are from the same seller, my hunch is the latter. Won't be ordering from them again.  Samoan sand is a pretty warm undertone beige neutral.",1.0
"This product isn't the real deal. It is not a authentic OPI product..I actually purchased the real product at target and although the color is somewhat similar it isn't what it truly is, it's also quite watery...Do not buy this product as it is not returnable, you will regret paying 5 bucks for a nail polish that is probably worth 1 dollar..:Just go to a beauty supply pay 4 more dollars and you'll still the real deal and you don't get ripped off like I did. On the picture it looks like the OPI nail polish containers I have and then you open it and it's not as it appears. I have uploaded pictures of the fake product and the authentic polishes I've purchased at the store...I have quite a collection old and new so with that being said do not purchase this product here it is not the real deal!!!! ..:see for yourself what you see is not what you will get...",1.0
Chips a whole lot faster than the other OPI colors I have.,1.0
Got it for My Wife. Nevertheless she said her nails chip within a day of applying it. She will just stick with gel nail polish instead.,1.0
Color not at all like in picture.  And beware---you can't return!,1.0
Polish was thick like it was old.,1.0
"Extremely disappointed.  I've used this color for years, but I received a horribly defective product this time around.  It was all clumpy and streaky and chipped in a couple of days.  This was my favorite nail polish, now I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",1.0
Knock off. This is more of an orange color and not the true coral that opi Cajun shrimp usually is.,1.0
Nail polish received was not new! There was polish clumped around the neck of the bottle. Threw it away!!,1.0
"I love opi overall. This came very thick and seemed really old. Have to send back, not sure if the store makes a difference because I've ordered other colors with no problem. Charged up cherry did not work out.",1.0
Poor quality.,1.0
"I love the color of 'Pink-ing of You' so much, I ordered 2 new bottles as 'back ups' to  the one I already own.  Even though the labels on the ones received clearly  state  'Pink-ing of You', they are in no way anywhere NEAR the same color of the existing bottle.  The color of polish in the new bottles is WAY off and definitely not the soft,  light pink of the one I own. Shame on OPI for changing the color of an existing polish and keeping the same name!!  Since they cannot be returned, I guess I am out of luck.  :(",1.0
Disappointed to the color doesnt look like the picture at all,1.0
Not the color shown in the pic.  It is pastel orange and I hoping for more of reddish orange tone.  I would of returned it but not worth the hassle.,1.0
"I'm pretty sure the nailpolish I receive is fake. It doesn't look like the OPI I usually buy in stores (Amazon bottle is on the left, store bottle is on the right).
I got the sparkly princess color. The picture looked like a baby pink with subtle sparkle color I had received in a salon and loved, but in reality it's a hot pink with brilliant sparkles that is more fitting for a 5 year old.",1.0
"broke too easy, just fall from 70''  and broke, I lost all of it. very disappointing  from quality.",1.0
The color is nothing like the picture!  It is a lot brighter in person and would be great for Halloween but that's about it!,1.0
"The color I received is not ""Tickle my France-y"" It is much pinker than the real color and a thicker consistency. I have a tester bottle at home and compared the color. The bottling is also different than the OPI bottles I have purchased before. The lettering is to big and close together, the font is not the same, there is usually a line under the ""nail lacquer"" line and the product description at the bottom of the label is usually in french and spanish. In short I do not believe this is an authentic bottle of OPI unless the product packaging and color has changed.",1.0
Doesn't spread evenly. I had to dab it on all over the nail to get the sparkles. I think my bottle was defective but seller DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS! My bottle had more clear polish than sparkles! Don't waste your money. This bottle is going to little girls to play with.,1.0
Very ugly color :/,1.0
The color is not gray nor blue. It is ugly. I threw it out after putting it on once.,1.0
I'm not sure if this is real product or a copycat.  The packaging is totally different than the rest of the opi nail polishes,1.0
The color is more pink than purple which I am fine with. It absolutely looks like it was watered down. It literally drips like water off the brush. Not OPI quality for sure and makes me question the vendor. I am very disappointed in this product.,1.0
No,1.0
"The product brush was defective.
The brush was stuck together and did not work.

When I opened the package my nails polish was broke!!! I am not happy,1.0
"I purchased this color thinking it would be the original ""20 Candles on My Cake"" that I used to own.  Please do not be fooled, this color is nowhere near what the original color is.

"This color looks deceptively red, but it is not.  It's a pale bronze with sparkle, after three coats.  Very disappointed in this color, and that doesn't usually happen with OPI.  If you are expecting a nice red with gold tone to it, do NOT buy this color...major disappointment.",1.0
"This is not the same color polish as before...they must have changed something""",1.0
I have been using sweet heart for years but this is the first time I experienced bubbles each and every time.,1.0
I received nail polish that wasn't brand new and appeared to have additional thinning ingredients added.  It remained sticky for hours and was therefore unusable.,1.0
I purchased this color based on the name after I used it at a recent pedicure. The color is not at all the same. Opi has done a poor job of color consistency. I really liked the color of the same name at my nail salon. The one that I ordered using the Opi name is an uninspiring color.,1.0
I love Opi nail polish however I do not like this product.  The color is not what I expected it to be.  You have to put lots of coats on for it to not be transparent.  After three coats and one top coat later it chipped off less than 9 hours later.  I just wasted my time and my money.,1.0
"I love OPI but this is OLD, clumpy, awful nailpolish that isn't useful at all. What a waste of money!!",1.0

"beautiful color but it is too old, dried out and thicken, very difficult to apply",1.0
"Do not be fooled my the picture they use. I purchased ""Sweer Memories"" thinking it was supposed to be a a nude pink and what came to me was basically a sheer cotton candy pink. Which is literally the same color as Essie ""Poppy Art Pink"". I will be returning it. Don't get me wrong, I love pink but this is not what was advertised.",1.0
My nail polish arrived with a huge sticker on it which left behind a gross residue that now attracts hair and dirt. This sticker totally ruined my nail polish and I would've ordered from somewhere else if I knew it was going to arrive like this.,1.0
"I bought the Alpine Snow color. It is very streaky, seems as if the color isn't distributed evenly (yes I shook the bottle and do know how to apply polish). It also did not dry well AT ALL. I think they gave me old stock as the polish wasn't that great of a quality. Be careful when ordering.",1.0
Recently got my nails done at a higher end salon w/ OPI Polish in ink. Loved the color so much.

Watered down; thin; I had to throw it away.,1.0
Not the same color as pictured. Much lighter than shown and you would need about three or four coats to have a full effect. I don't like it at all.,1.0
I've been wearing OPI nail polish for years and have never known it to chip within hours of application.

"I see a lot of reviews stating this polish is fake. While I don't think the bottle I was sent is a fake (A LOT of work would have had to go into it to make it look like a true OPI bottle), the product inside seems watered down.

"I got the amazON.. amazOFF as a gift. I applied it over existing polish so I wasn't too confused by it being lumpy and a pain to apply... it's a much darker green then I thought, I was going to excuse all of this for applying it over a light blue on my toes...
Til I went to take it off. This is NOT opi. This is a knock off. My toe nails are dyed green and I'm not sure HOW seeing as this green polish was applied OVER a bottom coat, 3 coats of blue and 2 top coats! How did it even reach my actual nails? They're totally dyed and I'm gonna have to have black toes as nothing else will cover it. I'm using hair dye remover to get it off my skin! I should have known by the lumpy yet thin consistency. Will not even put on my wishlist from this seller... this isn't the first time I've got a knock off OPI on amazon either! The photo is my nails after soaking in acetone AND buffing the dye off, still green!!! -and by knock off I mean it's old and watered down all at once-",1.0
peeled the next day.  Expected much better quality  from OPI,1.0

What a disappoint...and it's just been disappointment after disappointment w colors. I spent alot of money, and won't ever wear the stuff I rec'ved.

"If I coud give this 0 stars I would. The color is beautiful and goes on smooth. However, when you try to take it off...it will stain your nails and all your fingers. So you will have green fingers and nails. No amount of nailpolish remover would take it off. I had to go to the salon and pay for a mani/pedi in order to get rid of the stains left by the nail polish. It took several salon staff over 2 hours to get most of the color out of my skin. And even then, I had to paint over the nail, because the green did not come off. Worst experience ever.",1.0
Fake fake fake!!! The brush is different and the polish is watered down. Do not buy,1.0
This is almost white. Not nearly the pink they show in the picture. Won't buy polish on line again..,1.0

I received the wrong color. I ordered Cha Ching Cherry and received Color So Hot It Burns. Disappointed!,1.0
"I have a love/hate relationship with this nail polish for the last two years.  I love the way it dries SO fast (you have to use the infinite shine Top Coat to cure it) and lasts for a long time without chipping.  It's beautiful polish.  BUT after wearing it for a couple of weeks, it absolutely destroys my nails.  I don't know what it does, but my nails take a couple of months to come back to life.  My nails chip, crack and are just demolished after using this polish.  I've tried off and on for two years now and I guess I just have to stop using it.  I normally have very strong, healthy nails but something in this polish just sucks the absolute life out of them.",1.0
"I bought this in the pale blue ""To Infinity and Blue-yond,"" which had a bit of a shimmer in the pics. Nope. Polish was streaky and impossible to apply. First coat was uneven and thick--you could see every brush stroke--but a second coat made it so goop that it wouldn't dry. It was like using White-Out or semigloss house paint. (Both of which I've done in the past.) Third attempt, final versionshade is a thick powder blue, and the only ""shine"" comes from the flash on my phone camera. (Deep blue in photo is Essie Gel Couture ""Front Page Worthy""  you may be able to see the difference in texture.)",1.0
The polish i received wasn't the same as advertised it is more pink. I wanted this color because of getting a manicure at a nail salon and I loved the color. I am not happy since I can't even return it.  The 1st pic is the bottle I ordered and the 2nd is from the nail salon which is the same as advertised.,1.0
I thought it was gel polish but its regular and too expensive for regular polish,1.0
Worst buy ever. Doesn't become a solid color even when I put 3 coats on.,1.0
This OPI bottle came shattered in the box.,1.0
"This is the wrong color. I bought it because I liked the sample sized version I got, and wanted to keep wearing it. But when I got this it was a completely different color. I went to Target yesterday and found a bottle to compare them, and I think this one might be fake because the label looks different.",1.0
I have bought Nomad's Dream for many years.  But I haven't bought it the last several years from my hairdresser's nail display because it looked different.  By chance I saw the Amazon photo and it was the silvery pink I used to buy.  What I received today was completely different than the picture shown. It is a golden coral.  I am very disappointed.,1.0
I ordered a pearlized pink and got tan,1.0
This green color stained my nails so badly.  I now have to go around looking like I have mold growing under my nails.,1.0
"""Pearl of Wisdom"" color goes on streaky and irregular, their other colors are better at this.  Very unhappy with this",1.0
"One of the worst nail polishes I've owned/used.  I had to put on 4 layers for it to be black and it started chipping off by the next day.  I was wearing two colors black and orange, and the orange was perfect.  Never chipped and the black was thrashed when I removed it.",1.0
"Color was beautiful, but the glitter in the product damages my nails.",1.0
Garbage - chips right away.,1.0
Color nothing like what us shown. The picture showing the grannies nails are not the color that was sent. DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED.,1.0
Horrible color.  Has the consistency and look of White Out on your nails.  Threw away after painting two nails.,1.0
It was not the correct color at all!!!! So disappointing!!,1.0
Disappointed.  It was more glittery than shiny,1.0
HORRIBLE DONT BUY. When I received it was so thick unable to use.,1.0
Very  dull no shine,1.0
"Coverage is terrible. It takes at least 4 coats, if not 5 for fully coverage, in addition to the base coat and top coat, ultimately demanding at least 2 hours of patience to dry. Because of how many coats it requires, it also chips quickly and easily. Putting it on is a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.",1.0
Streaks very badly.,1.0
I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it came from Hong Kong.  It took almost a month to arrive and then had to be signed for.  The polish was thinner than it should have been and chipped after a few days.  It doesn't seem to be authentic OPI.,1.0
"Very see through. You can hardly tell there is polish on. its almost like a top coat for a French manicure-where you can still see everything underneath it. It's basically a top coat with a slight tint. If that's what you're looking for, this may be the polish for you.
From looking at the image online, I thought it was an opaque color, or at least somewhat opaque. It's totally translucent though.
Hope this helps your decision.
Cheers!",1.0
I don't think it's OPI. The worst polish ever. Doesn't go on evenly. Super thin. Bad all around.,1.0
i guess it was old. the Mrs. said it went on all gloopy and not smooth as it should.,1.0
"terrible finish.  Streaky, lumpy, poor coverage.",1.0
Product description not on Amazon website accurate.  The description says OPI Nail polish.  It should read GEL polish! TO MAKE IT WORSE THE ITEM IS NOT RETURNABLE!,1.0
"Orange, orange, orange.
If you're a Broncos or Syracuse fan this color is for you. Sadly, I ordered a product that claimed to be red...",1.0
This was not a good sale or a good product.  I believe that the polish was  old or defective.  It did not dry and look like the color in the bottle.  The vendor wanted to charge me a 15% restocking fee and pay for return postage.,1.0
I strongly suspect this is a cheap knock-off. I've had OPI polish at the nail salon and it doesn't start flaking off in the first day or two like this one does. I'm going to throw it out and buy something from my local shop.,1.0
"Needs multiple coats to cover, near impossible to apply without streams.",1.0
This color is definitely more of a brassy yellow than gold.,1.0
"Usually I LOVE OPI polish and have used it for years. But for some reason, this new formula is awful. It starts to chip off within 48 hours. I expect much more from OPI, especially for $12.50 per bottle. I've had better results from cheap Sally Hanson polish. The picture here is two coats of polish that I put on two days ago. Wretched looking! The only good news is that I won't need to use polish remover before my next polishing; all I have to do is wait a few more days and my nails will be bare when the rest of it chips off.",1.0
"Somebody must be color blind.  This polish is not deep burgundy, it is blood red even after 3 coats. Big disappointment.",1.0
"This is NOT really OPI. I purchased and used and it was so hard to paint on my nails. It was like glue. I purchased OPI from Sallys later that day to try and it was completely different and better. You cannot return this item. Save your time and money.

(I buy from Amazon at least once a week... never had an issue like this before.)",1.0
"The wrong color was sent and I never could get any satisfaction/re-send of the proper color. Also, product was possibly frozen, got too high a temperature or was old/defective.",1.0
"this color looks nothing like shown and you cannot return it or get a refund because of some issue with transport. It is like a blackish burgundy, horrible and gothic looking! I threw it away because I would never wear it and shown looks mauvish-burgundy. BEWARE!",1.0
Peels within 2 days,1.0
Chipped the next day. Don't waste your money,1.0
Color looks different and it makes bubbles on my nails.,1.0
I am so disappointed with this purchase. i discovered this color the other day at a nail salon. it was the most beautiful shade after only 2 coats. i just applied 4 coats and the color is still really light. nothing like the shade I had applied at the salon. I honestly think the sellers dilute the nail polish.,1.0
"This is a horrible product. It does not 'rapid dry'. It makes the polish, for a lack of s better word, gooey. Even after 2 hrs. I wish there was a returb policy. Complete waste of money!! This will be making it's way to the trash. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. OPI typically has a very high standard in my book. They dropped it on this product.",1.0
"I will be throwing this away because this stuff NEVER dries! I would paint my nails around 2pm and it appeared to be dry to the point where I could go about my day. But after going to bed at 10pm and waking up in the morning there would ALWAYS be tons of sheet prints when I woke up. I also only did 1 coat of the top coat, so its not like I used too much product. I don't experience this problem with their regular polish. Just this top coat. I bought Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat and am MUCH happier with that purchase.",1.0
"When I received this product it was broken in the package, there was nothing protecting it from being able to break nor a fragile sign to warn people thats its breakable",1.0
"Infinite Shine line is very streaky, the top coat doesn't level, so it may be shiny, but is very textured. Dries to a ripple texture just like CND Vinylux line. I am astounded that reputable lines release these products that are doomed. It may last longer because it's like latex or vinyl & therefore softer & less prone to chipping when nails are subjected to shocks & dings. But just looks aweful",1.0
Bottle came cracked in 2 places... afraid to even open this...... !!! Now what? stuck with something I can't use...,1.0
Love the color but it is so runny (not thick at all) I can't even use it.  I love OPI and I have never had a problem with OPI before.,1.0
"As someone else already commented, this polish color chips off after ONE DAY! I went back to Ulta to ask for tips, and the girls there suggested using alcohol prior to application to ensure the nail was dry. They suggested waiting plenty of time to let it dry between coats. I have tried this polish multiple times following all the steps and using all of the three infinite shine layer steps. Something is wrong with this color formula--for me anyhow. I have other colors in the ""infinite shine"" collection that don't have this problem.",1.0
"You can see the color in the picture is a deep red sparkle and what i received is a baby pink gel polish (with the same name, Indefinitely Baby). Amazon issued a refund.",1.0
"picture of color and name are incorrect, I received something with same name, but it is a baby pink and a lacquer.",1.0
Just because amazon didn't let me return this product I must to warn you guys. THIS IS NOT OPI. IS SOOO POOR QUALITY. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE. IM REALLY DESAPOINTED.,1.0
This stuff was terrible!!! No shine whatsoever. Total waste of time and money ,1.0
Stuff is horrible. I followed the directions exactly and it took less than 24 hours to start chipping off. Amazon could not accept a return due to policies about shipping chemicals but they issued me a refund anyway.,1.0
"Worst top coat I've used. I love OPI nail polishes, but this is terrible. It takes forever to dry, even after 8 hours it still dented.",1.0
I paid way to much for my nails to still be chipping the next day. I paid 10$ for literally nothing. Dont have the energy to return Ill just use it when i want a glossy look but don't plan on it protecting your nails.,1.0
"A pale pink (I would not call it nude), wasn't thick, and went on well, but dries streaky, even after three coats it was not opaque. I will have to use something else on top of it.",1.0
Never had an OPI polish that chips and peels off the same day I put it on. This one does. I tried it twice. Once with base coat and once with out and both times it chipped off within hours of my doing my nails. Very strange.,1.0
"This is not what I expected.  The polish looks like 'flakes'.  When removing......very difficult.  I love OPI nail polish, but not this one.",1.0
Bottle was old color was seperated,1.0
"I bought this polish (Opi Mod About You sold bu Pinnacle Supply fulfilled by Amazon) because a friend was wearing it and it matched my pink Electra beach cruiser bike EXACTLY. The color is fine but this polish arrived totally separated and is thick, streaky and impossible to put on nicely. I used to sit next to a lady at work who gave herself manicures with the white-out.  My nails look like a pink version of that nightmare.",1.0
"I bought Bee Mine Forever, put it on for the first time today. This polish is a darker yellow than it looks to be on the listing, which, ok, that happens, but it's just really terrible overall. The consistency is such that the first coat is streaky, and the second coat does not help, the streaks beneath are still visible. I have had it on for just a few hours now, having used the OPI base and top coat for this line, and it has chipped already even though I have done nothing chip-worthy. This line of polish is really hit-or-miss with color, consistency, and durability and I would say this one is a major loser. Also do not recommend the silver or Beyond the Pale Pink.",1.0
"Do not buy this, I LOVE the color but the nail polish quality is crap. I am really good at nails but this nail polish just WILL NOT go on without several coats and the consistency is like tar. Will not buy again.",1.0
The WORST quality--my nail color chips 3 times as fast with this coat. UGH.,1.0
"I bought a bottle of high shine top coat, shipped and sold by Amazon.  However I believe this is a knock off or thinned by someone.  The consistency is really watery, any drops on the nail immediately spreads and drips everywhere.  The tips of the bush immediately picks up color from well dried polish.  I had high hopes of getting a high shine, thick top coat, but the item I received is a really bad product.",1.0
It is not the opi brand . The product is very watery. When you look at the back the label is definitely a forgery. So surprising Amazon sells this product,1.0

"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come.",5.0
"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!",5.0
"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????",5.0
"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living.",5.0
"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait.",5.0
"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers.",5.0
"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good.",5.0
"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real.",5.0
"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!",5.0
"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good.",5.0
"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!",5.0
I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.,5.0
"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!",5.0
"It just so happens that I was at this very show at the HOB in hollywood.  As a matter of fact, I can be seen in many of the shots of the crowd.  This show was nothing short of amazing.  After the show I was permitted to socialize with the band in the upstairs room.  Pretty cool for an old dude like myself.

If you know X, this is a must.  If you are young and new, it's a great place to get a taste of music history.

"I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.

It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.

If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed.",5.0

"We got this CD/DVD set for our 2 year old, and I can't say enough about the quality of the music and lyrics.  This is clean, healthy, happy music!  The music is beautifully arranged and doesn't sound like a low budget synthesizer.  This is actually well orchestrated and professionally recorded.  The lyrics are straight out of the Bible, and a terrific way to memorize scripture!  Our son has thoroughly enjoyed the music, and begs for us to play it for him over and over.  We have listened to the CD so many times I'm amazed it hasn't gotten worn out, and even more amazingly my husband and I are not sick of it...on the contrary, we are sincerely uplifted by it.  It hasn't gotten on our nerves, the way so many other kid's CD's do.  The DVD is definitely outdated, as far as the outfits go, but the content and the music are delightful!  Don't hesitate on this purchase...you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Excellent dvd, lots of fun and great songs!  Steve Green is a wonderful artist.",5.0
"The clothing is dated, but the music and words are timeless.  My son has learned so much from watching this DVD.  We don't watch much television, but this is a great DVD for young children.  The music is catchy (but not irritating as a lot of childrens music is), and the words are straight out of scripture.  There is a nice variety of upbeat songs and quieter songs.  My son is almost 2, and he asks for his ""Bible Kids"" ALL the time.  Our copy is several years old and scratched, I came looking on Amazon to buy a replacement, but it is unavailable.  I hope if it is out of production that it will be remade in the future, I wish there were more DVD's like this on the market for kids.  I give this a five star rating for content and quality.  If you are going to be annoyed by the very 80's style clothing, I'll give it a four ;)",5.0

My granddaughter loves it! This is her bedtime music; she walks around the house singing SCRIPTURE.Steve Green's voice is that strong tender that brings respect for the WORD of GOD.,5.0
"When I was a little girl, my parents had both the VHS tapes and the cassettes for both Hide 'Em In Your Heart volumes. We also saw Steve Green do these live a time or two.  My siblings and I knew every song by heart, and we loved them.

Now, I have children of my own.  My daughter, barely two years old now, was given this DVD/CD combo pack by her Nonni and Poppop.  She knows all the songs.  Just yesterday she ran around singing ""My Father's House . . . Mickey Mansions . . . Prepare a place for YOU, for YOU!""  I almost cried with joy.

Having my children learn the Bible through these songs is priceless, especially since this was (and often still is) how I learned and remembered Scripture growing up.  The songs are short enough to hold interest and are easily learned by even the youngest child. My son is seven months old and, while he is too young to sing them, he recognizes them to the point that he will stop screaming and begin giggling and smiling when he hears the music begin.

Each song is introduced by the corresponding Bible verse and often a brief, simple explanation to help little ones understand what is being taught.

I cannot recommend this highly enough.  Get this music for your children and grandchildren and watch in wonder as they sing Bible verses all day long.  Hide 'Em In Your Heart got five stars from me as a child, and it has ten stars from me as a parent!",5.0
My son loves this video!  It came in perfect condition and in a very timely manner.  I would recommend this for parents with young children.,5.0
"I grew up with this on VHS, thats why I bought it for my boys. Loved that it was a DVD/CD combo. One in the house ,other in the car. My boys are entranced by this movie. I get so much done without them underfoot when its running",5.0
"I have three small children, one doesn't even watch tv yet.  The three and four year old will sit and watch the video.  It's great because as they go about singing the songs they are learning scripture.  No they don't understand everything, but it's hiding in their hearts for when they will need it later.  OK, a little silly, but they seem to like it.",5.0
"We enjoyed the original VHS, so I was already impressed with the content.

"I enjoyed the Gospel focused presentation of the history of our nation, but one section regarding the trial of a soldier for homosexuality is inappropriate for younger children. Also, later in the movie there are some clips of violence against a church by homosexual activists covered by news reports that would be too strong from young children.  Lastly, open displays of affection by homosexuals is covered by news reports at the end of the movie as well.  My advice is to view the movie yourself first and then determine what sections you can allow your children to view.  If you are not a Christian, you'll hate this movie.",5.0

The result of this journey will give us a better understanding of where America is today, how she arrived here, and where she must turn at this critical hour.

Plus, I saw things that are rarely mentioned now, perhaps because we are all trying to be so politically correct that we left a few things out that really happened.  Seeing is believing.",5.0
This is a real eye opener. You will feel outraged and saddened by what has slowly happened to this country. You will feel inspired to fight the good fight in order to not lose any more ground to the liberals in our country.

"There is an essential message here that is not being told in society today.  People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.

The other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.

We HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.  This DVD would be beneficial for viewing in every home, school, and church in this country.",5.0

"Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.  This is a great reminder of what liberalism and political correctness has done to the United States of America.",5.0
This is the history we need to be teaching in our schools. Everyone should see this!,5.0
A Nation Adrift is a must see documentary.  It tells you what your history books didn't or tells your children what they don't hear in school.  This true American history needs to be shown in every church across the United States.  We as Christians have failed to guard what God has given us.  God have mercy on us.  LW,5.0
Really excellent piece of work showing the beliefs of the founding fathers and what is happening now to our nation.,5.0
"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.
Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.
I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.",5.0
"When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was ""A Christmas Carol"".  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.",5.0
"I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.
In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.  All in  all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money.",5.0

"There are MANY versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the ""Scrooge"" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !",5.0

"I was thrilled to see, ""An American Christmas Carol"", on the Prime list.  I love the Dicken's story and this was a worthy adaptation that I remembered from my original viewing more than 30 years ago.  Set in early 20th century America, there are a few simple changes from the classic version.  Scrooge is a money lender, having grown rich by lending, then repossessing merchandise when his clients could not keep up on payments.
The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are represented by some of the clients.  But, anyone familiar with ""The Christmas Carol"", will have no trouble recognizing the storyline.

"I can recall watching Henry Winkler on a talk show when this movie came out on television.  He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  ""The Fonz"").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.

If you are fan of a Christmas Carol and have seen many of the cinematic variations and made for TV, this is one you really have to see.",5.0

"Henry Winkler brings an American flavor to Dicken's oft told tale. Set during the Great Depression, this telling of ""A Christmas Carol"", while still the same story of redemption, does it without a nephew and uses current medical problems afflicting ""Tiny Tim"". While purists might not appreciate the Americanization of this classic, anyone who loves this story in any format will thoroughly enjoy this movie.",5.0

"In this Americanized version of The Charles Dickens classic..which takes place in Concord New Hampshire on Christmas eve,1933..""Ben Slade""(played by Henry Winkler)is an insensitive and greedy time payment holder..who forces the citizens of the small New England village to either pay up their loans or lose all of their items. When they can't pay up..they lose all of their assets and he even fires his assistant""Thatcher""for trying to get his boss to reopen the failed  mill to create new industry and jobs for the unemployed workers. But ""Slade""soon learns the folly of his ways from the ghost of his late partner""Jack Latham""..who tells him that his cruel nature will be the ruin of him and to prevent his soul from being dammed..he must expects the visits of three more ghosts..that night..""Slade""does receive those visitations..and thru the retelling of his past and seeing tragedy of a lonely and sad death..he learns his lesson and although he doesn't became a happier soul like""Scrooge""..He does learn to deal with people in a better way..This film is a wonderful retelling of the Yultide tale and Mr. Winkler gives his best performance ever.",5.0
From all the Christmas Carol's I watched based on dickens book I liked this the best.  As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.,5.0

When I found this here I was delighted and couldn't wait till I received it in the mail..
Not as good as a story as it once rolled around in the mind of a young person who liked the Fonz, haha. Oh well it reminded me of old happy times. That is worth as many stars as I can give.",5.0

Too bad there isn't a remastered or enhanced version available.  Its 4:3 and obviously direct from the TV tapes.  Dont let that stop you from watching or buying it though!",5.0

"I do. I like every well made version I have seen.
This one, in my opinion is the best.
Without spoiling anything for you, here is why.
The setting is in a small New Hampshire town.
It is the tail end of the great depression.
We, in the USA, can relate to this as, know it or not, it has greatly influenced todays society.

Our grandparents  were very thrifty throughout their lives as a result of these hard times.
Then, many of their children, as adults did a complete turnaround when it comes to spending, credit, and unknowingly influenced this me me me society we now witness. So now, maybe more than in Dickens' time, we can benefit from such a lesson.

More important, in my opinion, is the detail the writer used when the ghost of past showed Slade of his childhood as well as the detail of Slade's reaction at the end.
This big tough guy's eyes well up everytime I watch it.

As a couple others said, I stumbled on this movie on TV. Mid 1990's .TBS?  Quickly put in a vhs tape to record. Later,  with software, switched all my tapes to DVD.
This one, on switching, the last minute or two were destroyed.  Plus, the fact that I didn't record the very beginning and the way networks edit out several minutes to cram extra commercials, I am so looking forward to seeing, for the first time, the entire movie.

IN BLUERAY NO LESS. PSYCH!!",5.0

"The best filmed version of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen.  Henry Winkler is brilliant.  Many times, I've given this film as a Christmas gift to an entire family - and it is always well received by young and old.  One of my favorite scenes is when Scrooge is about to see his first ghost - can feel a haunting approaching - and is looking for an intruder among all the belongings he has repossessed from people unable to keep up on the payments.  There is a malice in his action and it makes the belongings look haunted.  Really effective.",5.0
Great,5.0
A must have for anyone who loves the Charles Dickens original. A great holiday movie for the family.,5.0
"This movie was a 1979 TV special that we watched and really enjoyed when it first aired. Henry Winkler starred as Benedict Slade (""Scrooge""), and the movie was set in Concord, New Hampshire during the Depression era.  Unfortunately, it was only broadcast a few times over the following years. It never became an annual Christmas classic like other Christmas movies.  It was available on VHS tape for a few years, but these tapes went out of production, and became hard to find, and thus expensive when found. The movie did not immediately become available on DVD, as I looked for it over the years. When we found the Blue Ray on Amazon while looking for other Christmas titles last Christmas (2013), we bought it!",5.0

"I received the dvd in perfect condition and relatively quick.  The seller delivered as promised!

"Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film.",5.0
"This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens Christmas Carol, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see.",5.0

This movie is as valuable as any modern-day teachings I've read within the context of ""how to be a better person, live well, and do it right in the new year"".

"I wasn't expecting too much from this film, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the production and acting!  Henry Winkler (famous for playing ""the Fonz"" on Happy Days) proves his acting abilities and range of emotions in this satisfying film.  Some unexpected twists and just enough grit to make it evocative of Depression Era America make this a nice take on the Christmas classic.  (P.S.  Just wait for the Ghost of Christmas Futureso wouldn't think that would work out well, but it did!!!  That's all I'm saying. Love it.)",5.0
"Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.

"The first time I saw ""An American Christmas Carol"" I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.

"The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual ""must watch"" story for me.",5.0

It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, ""A Christmas Carol,"" did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.

"The Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories, and there have been a lot of different versions made. This one, with Henry Winkler, is different. He does a wonderful job playing Scrooge!! The setting is in depression era America, instead of England, and that makes this version better (I think). It's like watching history.

This movie is definitely worth watching!!",5.0

Oh Henry, you prove over and over what a quality actor can do for stage and screen.",5.0

"I can't believe how long it took ""them"" to get this wonderful Christmas show on DVD. It's a modern (1930s America) twist on Charles Dickens' classic tale.

"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale.",5.0

"Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.

Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.

This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.",1.0
"I thought I remembered this film as a good one from television many years ago but I had obviously forgotten it completely. It's poor quality film, dated and badly written. Henry Winkler's make up is just awful. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I collect Christmas Carol films  but this one that will never go in the dvd player again!",1.0

"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies.  This is an okay movie.  I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives.  The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

Potiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis.  The scene does not show sexual parts of course, but her hand goes down pretty deep.  She invites him to sleep with her a few times.

There are several extremely offensive references to women, like ""they talk to much"" or ""they gossip.""

Again, the movie is okay and the sex scenes did not offend me.  My problem is that the movie is not rated and it should be at least PG13.  I wish I had not watched that movie with my two daughters.  I am upset.",1.0

"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.",1.0
"Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment. Please do not grieve the Holy Spirit by subjecting yourself to this.

""Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!"" - Jesus (Matthew 6:22, 23)

""... the light you think you have..."" Selah.",1.0
"The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.

At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  ""Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?""  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.

What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that ""they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.""

Another reviewer writes, ""Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...""  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?

And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?

Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.

I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, ""Praise be to God"" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.

And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.

The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and ""the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.""  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?

Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.

If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us.",1.0

Shame on Golden Books for including this with the original Frosty. Wish I could rate this a ZERO but I wasn't given that option.",1.0
"I hated this special.  Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love.  Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty.  There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs.  So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network.  Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland?  ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays.  But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk.",1.0

"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason.

Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead.",1.0
"I just watched this sad excuse for a cartoon for the first time after viewing the original classic Frosty the Snowman. All I could think was is this country in trouble. Simply put the movie was worse than anything I could have ever imagined. It is an insult to the original cartoon.

How often do you hear any commercials on television or radio mention Christmas anymore? The term Christmas is practically banned from the public airwaves. I say boycott any business that refuses to use the term Christmas in their advertising. Thank god there are some of us old enough to remember what this country and it's traditions use to be like. It was at one time the greatest country in the world, currently being destroyed by the communist enemy within. I fear for the future of this Country. And in closing I must add, who ever heard of a winter carnival? I can say with confidence that this cartoon caused Jimmy Durante to turn over in his grave. An absolute disgrace.",1.0

"I really had to hunt to get all these, but I am seriously disappointed for 2 reasons. First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, ""HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me"". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.

Another problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.

My second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.

I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't. I have tried several times over the last few months and it's just frustrating. Overall it's an incredibly amateurish project totally out of character for something with Zondervan's name on it. This is why it simply must have a 1 star rating.",1.0

"I discovered I had a vaginal prolapse after having issues removing a tampon (I typically wear pads, but was in a bind back in May and wore a tampon for the first time in my life). The prolapse is most likely from the birth of my daughter two years ago.

I started doing this DVD back in the very beginning of June...and instead of doing it three times a week, I ramped it up to roughly one workout every day/other day. I cycled through exercises one through four for each day I did it. I went out and bought an exercise ball (well, two - a large and a small) and additional stretch bands. I also did kegals, as suggested, throughout the day everyday (held kegal for 8 seconds with four quick flicks). It is now mid-July and my vaginal prolapse is no better and no worse than when I started the exercises. Literally no improvement whatsoever.

Does this have the possibility to help other women? It apparently has and probably will for some, but it did absolutely nothing for me.",1.0

"The material was probably good, but the DVD could not be maneuvered from segment to segment.

"It will play on my desktop computer, but my computer is in my office, and I can't do exercises there.  The DVD will not play properly on my fairly new blue-ray dvd player.  It only shows the intro and posture chapters.  It will not go to the workouts.  It will only include the intro posture menu.

"The whole DVD teaches about 40 very basic words, my 4 year old can learn all that in half day.

If you want your kid to lean Chinese seriously, go find something else.  $50 for 40 words? It's not worthy.",1.0
"Don't be swayed people. I was an SDA for 35 years. The doctrine of the church goes against the Gospel of Jesus Christ in so many ways, it's not even funny. Rather than buy this movie, might I suggest that you buy one or all of these books to find out the history & doctrines of the SDA church.

Second, they do not have the strongest historians on their writing staff.  e.g. He makes fun of Abigail Adams for her poor spelling, when at that time, spelling was not standardized.  You could make fun of the other founding fathers for the same flaw.  If you know American history, this DVD will drive you crazy with all the little mistakes...

"This was not a box office hit when it was first released; most critics hated it.  Time has not tempered its many flaws.  The humor is broad and at times overbearing, abrasive.  The lead character is a nitwit, obnoxiously stupid.  Oddly enough, this is the only character played for laughs, the rest are deadly serious in their intent (none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise).  The effect is quite jarring, as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds, the piece was now a gritty spy thriller.  Unfortunately, it's never as funny as it should have been, and not serious enough to work on any other level.

This is not a movie I'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance.",1.0

"I love this movie, and have been waiting for it to be released on dvd. Unfortunately, the dvd was not worth the wait. The dvd has no features whatsoever, not even subtitles. The main menu has two options, play movie and chapter selections. The sound and picture are no better than the video; the only benefits the dvd has over the video are that you can fast forward directly to a specific scene, and you have your choice of full screen and wide screen (double sided dvd). What's the point of making a dvd if it is as bad as this one? Very disappointing....

"Grade-Z spy spoof starring the insufferable Michael Crawford, who would fortunatly redeem himself as the Phantom. The movie plays like one of those bad low-budget afternoon adventure shows on the USA Network. And the  special effects are dreadful. Sure, the movie is targeted toward children,  but even they will notice that the wires are easily visible when Condorman  flies. This isn't uncommon in special effects movies (even the most  expensive productions have their faults), but in this case the wires are so  visible and distracting (they almost look like ropes) it ruins the entire  fantasy element. I'm surprised Disney even greenlighted this project.  Pathetic.",1.0
"This is a terrible film -- low-budget seat-of-the-pants filmmaking with an exceedingly thin plot line. But in a way, it's still worthwhile viewing for  fans of the sublime Oliver Reed, who makes a wonderfully sinister villain  (Russian this time); and Michael Crawford, who is his usual endearing self.  The latter's performance in ""Condorman"" is reminiscent of his  role as Cornelius Hackel in ""Hello Dolly,"" which is to say it's  about as far away from the Phantom as you can get. Still, the film is  amusing at times. But check out ""The Assassination Bureau"" if  you're an  Oliver devotee.",1.0

"The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.

In this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in ""Wives and Daughters"", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version

The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.

The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: ""Oliver Twist"" 1839, ""A Christmas Carol"" 1843, and ""David Copperfield"" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story ""Great Expectations"" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.

Charles Dickens's book ""Oliver Twist"" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The ""Oliver Twist"" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play ""Oliver Twist""; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story ""Great Expectations"" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.",1.0
"Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.

Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.

It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.

If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market.",1.0

"As a talented actor, Toshiro Mifune portrays his roles more definitively as a Japanes Samurai or SHOGUN, not a stranded soldier on an island.

In comparison to his other films, I found Hell in the Pacific to be quite boring. I can cleary understand the dialogue between Lee Marvin and Mifune yet the film could have pumped up a notch with at least a shred of Budo action from Mifune. Its evident from their first encounter on the beach that Mifune's raw talent could have produced a dramtic fight scene but they are left standing there, fiercely gazing at one another with no climax.

Chanbara films of today are far more entertaining and not conservative like Hell in the Pacific. I recommend ""Seven Samurai"".",1.0
"I wouldn't call myself a Woody Allen fan but I thought this film was simply hilarious and most of the jokes and gags hold up well even today and if you like off-beat humour ala ""There's Something About Mary"" or even ""Saturday Night Live"" you will find a lot to like about this film.  The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.

The only problem is with the dvd which is not restored in any way and so the picture and sound quality really suffer in comparison with what's currently out there.  There are no special features of note either.  This film is certainly one of the funniest and most enjoyable that I've ever seen but my advice is to wait for the Blu-ray version that significantly restores the picture quality as well as adds good special features and has good audio options such as at a minimum a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option to do justice to your home theatre system.",1.0

Now when we try to go to the potty she tells me she doesn't have to cause she can pee in her diaper that's what diapers are for.  So thanks a lot for throwing me back a few steps and wasting almost $15!  We then bought Elmo's Potty Time and she loves it and I think it is way better than this one was.

It is really annoying that they have messed up the episodes by putting them in the wrong order and mislabeling them.  Half the tension in the episode they list as first is confusing if you haven't watched the THREE episodes that predate it.  The occasional mislabeled episode in the previous seasons was easy to overlook, but in this case, its flat out unprofessional.

"Just a terrible movie.  Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent ""Austin Powers"".",1.0
"Dear God!  Did this movie suck ass!  Even Sean Connery's entire coolness couldn't save it!  Unlike Highlander 2, his scenes were some of the worst!  If you can get thru the ""Teddy Bear"" scene, you are a better man than I!",1.0
"Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.

First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.

Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!

It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.",1.0
"I can't remember the last time I turned a movie off out of sheer boredom.  When my daugher is watching Elmo's Potty Time, even that show is able to hold my attention for the entire program.

Seriously - I tried to watch this movie on two different occasions and it failed to make me want to watch it thru to it's conclusion both times.  I found myself distracted by the least little thing.  Watching a bird out the window, counting how many times the ceiling fan rotated every 60 seconds,  trying to determine if this number was constant or variable, if not constant then how many rotations did it vary per minute, was there a pattern to this variation,  what's for lunch,  blt sandwich maybe?  Bacon... mmmm... bacon.....

-sorry, back to the review.

I've never seen an episode of the original TV show so I didn't have the element of familiarity to help me out - but from what I've read in other reviews similarities between the TV show and this movie are few.

Some people may say that since I haven't watched the whole movie I have no right to give it a bad review.  I say the fact that I COULD NOT watch the whole thing speaks for itself.",1.0
"Even though ten years older than myself, it is clear that director Jeremiah Chechik didn't have a clue as to what made the TV version a draw (Diana Rigg).  If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake.  When Val Kilmer took on the role of ""The Saint"" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television.  It should have been Noyce directing ""The Avengers-1998"" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell.  I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE!  But it wasn't....not even close.  Keep your fingers crossed for the 2012 version.",1.0
"I used to watch the show as teen and would catch it on A&E when it used to come on. Sure it was campy but it was fun to watch. This movie is no such luck. It was doomed from the minute the director screamed action. The whole plot involves some asinine scheme by August De Wynter(played by Sean Connery) to control the world weather. The British secret service assign Emma Peel(Uma Thurman) and John Steed(Ralph Fiennes) to the case. The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called ""Mother"") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter. When you're not laughing at the cheesy dialogue, you cracking up at the hackneyed fight scenes and the overacting by Sean Connery, who seems to have more fun chewing up scenery even though he advised people not to watch it. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice. This movie wasn't pre-screened for a reason and Sean Connery did warn people not to see this movie. You can put two and two together and see the outcome. People overact like its going out of style, the humor is on par with those Roger Moore James Bond flicks and the premise is pretty juvenile. If you liked the show you'll hate the movie.",1.0
"How can you improve on perfection?  The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever.  It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.

By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.

This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.  Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable.  I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen.  That answers the question:  you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.

Not recommended.  THere are far better things to waste one's time on.",1.0
"As someone who was an insatiable fan of The Avengers British TV series, I was horrified when this movie appeared in 1998.  I have always felt that one cannot improve upon perfection, and, at least as far as I was concerned, the original Avengers was about as close to that as anything can be, and still be man-made.  Because of this, I vowed NOT TO SEE IT!

All right...granted, this movie has a marvelous cast, and even boasted a cameo role for Patrick Macnee (the first -- no, make that the REAL John Steed), but this was just another case where a great cast does not necessarily a good movie make.

Well, I kept my vow for all these years, but finally broke down and recently watched The Avengers, the movie.

OUCH!

Even Sean Connery couldn't pull this one out of the dumpster!  It was painful.  I was only able to suffer through half of it before I had to eject the disk in self defense!  To cleanse myself, I watched three straight hours of the REAL Avengers immediately.

If you are tempted to watch this travesty because you fancy one of the stars...DON'T.  Go and purchase another of their films instead, or, better yet, go and find the original Avengers and have at it!  You'll be delighted, entertained, and you'll see it done the way it was INTENDED.

This was just...sad...",1.0
"Sean Connery is an evil scientist that wants to blackmail the major countries with his evil device that can wreak havoc in the world. The Avengers must find him and stop him. Even the great Connery couldn't save this dog from the DVD discount bins in Walmart, although his performance brings the only class to this sham.

Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor in many other things. In this one he just missed that brilliant sparkle that the British own, and he doesn't get it. While he was brilliant in movies such as Schindler's List, this is another one of his hit and misses. I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.

The plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.

I wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored. I'm only hoping that another sequel isn't made, this was enough of a waste of money and film.",1.0

The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was.

"I like bad movies sometimes, especially ones with big budgets. But all the other reviews were right, this is a bad movie! I am not a fan of, or seen many of the original ""Avengers"", so I had no preconceived ideas that way about how the story should go. And had really wanted to ""enjoy"" a big budget, bad movie. It doesn't start out to bad, but I found the lack of chemistry between all the actors to be unbearable. It's like they are all acting in separate movies, or have some sort of off screen feud going on, and refuse to talk to each other. But in the appalling delivery of lines, apparently written by someone with a severe lack of imagination and no sence of humor.

 Also, if you had seen only this movie with Sean Connery, you would wonder just why he was an actor. The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.

 And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the ""supporting"" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.

 So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad. And you have to enjoy the only opportunity to see a deeply respected actor(Connery), make a fool of himself in a gigiant bear suit. Other than that, if you really must find out how bad this is...rent it!",1.0
"Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.

Rent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed.",1.0
"This movie must have been done by ""The Producers.""  Every thing possible to make it unrealistic seems to have been done.

Steed and Emma seem to be culturally lower class people who have come into inheritances which they use to buy expensive clothes.  The actress that plays Emma would be more realistically cast as a prostitute.

The characters substitute arrogance for talent.

My favorite bad scene is where Emma is walking away from Steed and unable to see him.  She has her sword over her shoulder point to her back.  Steed hits her sword on opposite sides with his sword.  This is something the Three Stooges would do.  The real Steed would have whacked Emma's bottom with his sword.",1.0
"At last I got to see this film.  I wish I did not!  This is nothing short of kidnapping the characters of Mrs. Emma Peel and John Steed by a squad of Hollywood SCAVENGERS!  I could understand pairing Steed with a new female partner played by Thurman.  Thurman fails miserably (and embarrasingly) at capturing the essence of a cultural icon of the caliber of Mrs Peel.  I found myself so embarrased watching Thurman stumbling her way in her unconvincing attempt to embody the character of Mrs Peel.  Way to go Uma :-D  The other problem is:  Fiennes is NO Steed.  Gone is the wit and charm, the playful sexuality, and the magical chemistry!  Thumbs down!  Hopefully we'll have something better next time! Meanwhile, hold on to your Mrs Peel Megaset DVD set :-)  Of course, one would say that we, the hard core fans of the TV show, should lighten up.  Issue is that I expect a multimillion project in the form of a film production to open up new vistas, and to throw new light on that landscape we know very well from the TV show.  Thurman, Fiennes, and the script writer of the film were not expected to copy and imitate.  But at least to give us the viewing pleasure of what we came to expect in that experience of watching the TV show.  Instead, we got an infantile love affair, childish sexual gazes that lacked the vagueness and playful complexity of Riggs' Emma and Macnee's Steed, silly lines, and gestures that lacked vitality, and so on and so forth (by comparison, we all know the endings, for example, of 'Too Many Xmas Trees,' 'The Negative Positive Man,' and 'The house that Jack Built,' to name only a few).  What I expected is a Thurman that could have enriched the character of Emma.  What we got is an Emma melting to a kiss on one occasion, and an Emma who is so mistrustful of Steed because he dared look at her asleep!",1.0
"Let me just say that I love all the Avengers from Mrs. Gale to Tara King (for the most part) and I do love the actors of The Avengers movie but this movie stinks. It has nothing to do with the original show. First off Mrs. Peel never dealt with Mother. Mrs. Peel also did not have an on screen affair with Steed either. But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.

Nothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.

Stick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie.",1.0
"Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......

On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.

In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.

The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.

After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.

A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.

There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.

I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.

The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.

The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.

Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).

I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.

(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)

"Let's face it...this movie is terrible, whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series.  I went in with an open mind, knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel.  I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight.  WRONG.  The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.  The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked, but since the whole movie was such a drag, I'm not sure anything could save it.  Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role.  Too bad Uma didn't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel.",1.0
"To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.

When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.

To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.

The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.

So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.

The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.

There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.",1.0

I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay.  I should have left during this one.  In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return.  One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day.  There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold.  They decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities.  They are all dressed in giant, multi-colored Teddy Bear costumes!!!  What?  Yes, you read it correctly.

"I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.
This is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film. The television Avengers' unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster.",1.0
"I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released. I'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters. The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who):
""Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.""
That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.
Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.
There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.
The final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable.",1.0
"What a mess.  I was so disappointed by this film (especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it).  There's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed.
And it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.
Personally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl.
Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.
But the movie is incomprehensible.
I'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director?
I've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film.
""Mrs. Peel, we STILL need you!""",1.0
"I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.
I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.
What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).
The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.
Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.",1.0
One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible. He fights people with an umbrella and she can't fight at all. Mechanical bees chase their car and it was so exciting! Not! I hated this movie and Sean Connery lost any respect that I had for him. Don't ever drink tea again and eat your muffins somewhere else!,1.0
"I already own seasons 1 thru 4, so I'm very disappointed not to be able to purchase 5 and 6 separately. The price of the complete set is a bit high when I only need two seasons. Not sure what to do, but I'm hoping the price will go down, or they will also release 5 and 6 at a later date. I do like the Bob Newhart Show, it was always a favorite.",1.0
The distributor really showed their true colors.  Those who had already bought the first several seasons found that the only way they could purchase the last two seasons of the show was to repurchase the disks they already had as part of this boxed set.  From now on we'll just do without until all the seasons are released.,1.0
"from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this??? The Script is bad, but the editing even worse. There's nothing going for this movie, even the acting looked bad, the Director didn't have a clue of what he was doing. Don't watch this movie even if you have time to waste, is just not worth it.",1.0
"This is a botched abortion which shares nothing more than the title with the superb original 1960's series.  The lack of care and scorn for the original material and the audience is shocking.  The writer, director and producer of this calamity, if they have any honor, should repudiate this disgrace.  Trust me, DON'T WATCH IT!!!",1.0
"First of all I'd like to put this review into perspective, I wanted so much to like this movie. I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?
This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.
This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.
The saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.",1.0
"""The Avengers"" may be the most dreadful film ever released by a major studio.  A laughable plotline, an infantile screenpaly, an embarrassing script...this movie has it all. If you did not see it in the theaters, by all means rent it (DON'T buy it, for heaven's sake).  Everyone who enjoys movies needs to see this incredible barker. It makes the second half of ""Barton Fink"" seem like best picture material.",1.0
"I tried not to set my hopes too high but this was ABSOLUTELY awful, and embarrassing to boot. Thurman is a fine Peel and Fienes is quite OK (although there's  not much found in the way of the strange ambivalence (like? love? mere professionalism?) in the relation between Steed and Mrs. Peel from the series), but Connery does this one straight from the teleprompter. No credibility, no presence, no strength.  Arguably his worst performance to date.
The retro-look is too glib, and a sense of humour sorely lacking. The film tries VERY hard to be surrealistic (with the Baddies dressing up as teddybears and not-quite-but-almost Bond-like gadgets) but everything the desperate producers throw at us is hollow (You can almost hear them pleading with the audience: ""Now THIS is really funny and weird? Isn't it? Isn't it?"").
A pathetic excuse for a film, even when not compared to the original Avengers. Give this one a miss. It's REALLY not worth your time.
Best Avengeresque part: Peel trying to escape DeWinter's castle, running through the same hallway over and over again... Oh, and yes, that IS Patrick Macnee's voice as Invisible Jones!",1.0
This version of the Avengers doesn't even come close to doing justice to the original series.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The original series was full of fresh ideas and good writing.  The movie is one of the worst remakes of a TV series that I have ever seen.,1.0
"There are some interesting visuals in this painfully bad mess of a film (in particular a scene where the lead characters step out of giant bubbles, for no apparent reason), but that's all the good that's here. Every other aspect is dreadful. The only way to watch this horrendous flop is to turn the sound down & listen to some music you like. Don't put yourself through the torture of listening to the dialogue.",1.0
"I grew up in England, hence I tend to feel more affinity with UK based films in general. However, that doesn't save this film from extreme mediocrity. Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.
This film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.
I'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD. The only people who would find this very interesting are young producers finding out how not to make an action movie. For me, I'll open another beer and stick to those LA cops.",1.0
"I agree with those who commented that this isn't one of those movies that's so bad you have to laugh at it--it's worse. I do remember moaning ""kill me"" once or twice after about 20 minutes of trying to figure out why this movie was ever made. I also remember the intermission, where I was torn between going to McDonald's before they closed and staying to see if the second half was any better. One minute later I was eating a burger and drinking coffee.

Update: In retrospect, I realize this review is utterly useless to anyone who hasn't seen the movie.  It's been a long time since I saw this movie and I've blocked most of it out, but from what little I do remember, it was more of a fashion show than a story.  To this day I have no idea what the plot was.  I assume people who saw the ""Avengers"" TV show back in the 60s (?) might get some subtle references, but from my vantage point this was an utter waste of some very talented actors.",1.0
"THE AVENGERS is, hands down, one of the worst films that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few bad ones). I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned.",1.0
"Wow.  I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the previews for ""The Avengers.""  At least the previews were entertaining.  The beginning of  the movie started out pretty good, but it was downhill from there.
Can we  say, ""movie turns into a fashion show?""  For crying out loud,  every single time Uma left a scene and came back, she had on a new hot  little number for an outfit.  If I wanted to see a fashion show, I would  have stayed home and turned on my cable.
I absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.  His lines were stilted, he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was  doing, and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie.  Was  this supposed to happen?  I don't know.
I do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.  Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time  Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit.
The special effects  were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie.  The bubbles  they walked in, those big mechanical bees, and the high-flying act at the  end were all pretty dang cool.  I just wanted more out of the characters.  I wanted more out of the plot.  I wanted more out of Sean Connery's  villain.  I wanted more out of the relationship between Uma and Ralph.  Perhaps I wanted too much, but when coming right down to the nitty gritty,  that's usually what the criteria is for making what most people consider a  ""good"" movie.",1.0

"Just adding another voice to the crowd. I've been gritting my teeth for eight years (well, a little less since it took a little time to realize that Fox was screwing us over) over not getting the rest of the series. I've always liked Shout! Factory; I've considered them the Rhino for the new millennium in terms of putting out product that really delivers for fans. But this is just unacceptable. Another reviewer mentioned that he'd spoken to Shout about it and that they plan to release seasons 5 and 6 individually. But a) it may not happen, and 2) it's still not cool making us wait. How on earth do you justify a release like this? Where's the logic? Did NO ONE at Shout look at the countless reviews (and IMDB message boards, for that matter) decrying the absence of the last two seasons? I don't have the market research numbers, of course, but I imagine that a significant percentage of potential buyers for this were in my situation. The ratings and reviews here certainly bear it out. I very much want the last two seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" but I'm not about to pay this much to get four seasons I already own and, more importantly, support this misstep. Shout and other studios, take notice: if we don't refuse to buy it, how will you learn?",1.0
"Hoping the re-make would get the spirit of the old series I bought this DVD ... and would like to warn everybody to repeat that mistake.

Plot - Well not Much can be said for it since it really was awful, Did you care  what happened? Did anyone come across well? No!  The shame was that the  potential was there but unforunately this mix of a typical Hollywood Plot  & the sureallism that was attempted failed dismally. It's a pity though  , I felt that Thurman & Fiennes made a good Steed & Mrs Peel, pity  they had nothing to work with.",1.0
"If you have to read a novelization to fill in the plot holes, it isn't worth doing.
No matter who is to blame for this travesty, be it editor, director, screenwriters, the terribly lethargic performances from Thurman  and Fiennes (I personally would lay the blame at the feet of the lot of  them), it isn't worth the time or money.
I'm not even much of a fan of  the original, having only watched an episode or two if that, but this- this  is a pathetic film.
There is zero chemistry between the two stars, Sean  Connery hams it up (and with dialogue like his, can you blame him?) and the  plot, as has previously been stated, well.. saying it ""has holes""  is an understatement of the first order.
An amateurish effort all around.  Who would have throught that a film with Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and  Sean Connery would be so... boring?  I wouldn't even give it one star, but  I'm being told that that isn't an option.",1.0
"This film is a real treat for the eyes, especially on a properly calibrated monitor.  It is also a very satisfying audio experience in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Unfortunately, the script does not even come close to the  quality of the video transfer or the soundtrack.  The first 20-30 minutes  of the film are an amusing reminder of the charm of the old TV series, but  things fall apart quickly after that.  The perils introduced by the  antagonist, Sean Connery, are unbelievable in the extreme.  No amount of  surreal interpretation can convince the viewer that they are anything but  ridiculous.  The gross incompetence of many characters is evident as both  good and evil fail repeatedly to accomplish even the simplest of tasks to  which they set themselves.  Even if one is able to get past the silly  devices and look only at the story, the narrative is mundane and  predictable.  If it were not for the fabulous transfer to DVD and the  delicious Ms. Thurman, I don't believe I could have gotten any farther than  one-third of the way through this mess.  As it was, I only got to the  (anti) climactic end battle because I couldn't find my remote.",1.0

"I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.

1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.

2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to ""try it out"", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.

3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for ""jumping the gun"" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event.",1.0

Uma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel.  Her English  accent sounds awkward and contrived.  Often she accents the wrong word  within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the  meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue  cards.

"i love the avengers...of course i'm talking about the tv show.patrick macnee and diana rigg were always charming and sly,making the plot almost secondary,but always interesting.now on to the movie....mr.fiennes and  ms.thurman are neither charming or sly,and neither they nor the plot is  interesting. even sean connery,the BRILLIANT sean connery,who has given us  such memorable performances in such movies as:the rock,medicine man and,of  course,bond,james bond, this time just gives us a headache. the basic plot  is that sean,playng the villian,sir august dewinter(subtle) wants to  control the weather. the sad thing is even after you watch the movie,you're  not really sure why. there's also an ""emma peel"" twin on the  loose,and poor patrick macnee as the invisible guest. don't ask me to  explain it,really...it's just so...i can't even say contrived,that would  give the plot too much depth..it's more like a defrosting refridgerator  with the food left in. and is it just a coincedence that uma has been in  the two worst films of all time,(""batman & robin"" being the  king,and this coming a close second!),or is this a case of the odor in the  elevator every time she's in it. i don't know,but all i do know is,DON'T  WASTE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS!!!!not even connery could save this  one.",1.0

"After years of owning the book, I finally got around to reading it a year or two ago.  Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!
..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
_________

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).
If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.",1.0
"This version is the 3rd that I have found to have fallen short of the mark.  This one is more likeable of the 3, but still not the best.

  Ciaran Hinds does his best, but it's his delivery.  Any way, it's not one that I want to add to my Jane Eyre collection.

  I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!",1.0

"Gentle reader,

I hated this version.  I usually enjoy Samantha Morton's work, but she declined to act in this film...and Ciaran Hinds chewed the scenery so much, I'm surprised that there were walls left standing at Thornfield...even after the fire!

There is very little character development in this script and I found myself not caring about Jane or Rochester, which is a problem when presenting ""Jane Eyre.""

For my money, there hasn't been a better, more fully-realized Rochester than Orson Welles.",1.0

"This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.",1.0
"I have seen all the Jane Eyre versions and this one is by far the WORST of all of them! This is the only Jane Eyre version I would never own or buy or even want as gift. The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one.  I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie. I would not want this version even for free.",1.0
"She's the only good aspect of this rendition. Considering that there are so many other versions of this amazing story to enjoy DO NOT waste your time on this one. I'm not the type to lean on the melodramatic, I really am serious about how poopy I thought this version is.",1.0
"What makes Jane Eyre a timeless novel is it's brilliantly colorful and evocative narrative. Charlotte Bronte's true talent is in her wording and her vivid and unique characters. This movie falls desperately short on these most important fronts. The narrative to this adaptation is poor indeed and lacks any of the fiery spark of the novel. Rather than choosing to re-work the first section of the story touching on Jane's childhood, a voice-over jumps from moment to moment so that we have only brief flashes of her early life, making for a stilted and bumbling beginning. The filmography is desperately lacking, and by inserting ""imaginary"" voices and images into Jane's perception, appears to imply a psychotic rather than imaginative narrator. Samantha Morton, whose work is usually delightful and full of life, is the image of Jane without any of the spirit. Ciaran Hinds, though he has some of Mr. Rochester's manner, is lacking in the overall demeanor. Gemma Jones makes for an unnecessarily snappish Mrs. Fairfax and Timia Berthone's acting is self-conscious to the point of embarrassment.

I am deeply disappointed in A&E whose work can usually be depending upon. Overall, this was a waste of the $2.00 spent on rental fees.",1.0
"I won't write a diatribe about what I hated with this version, so I'll sum it up in as few points as possible:

-Samantha Morton too cute and young - she looked like she was 12
-Ciaran Hinds: too old and creepy for the part, came across as a raging, shouting bull during the whole movie. Rochester was an angry man but he wasn't THAT angry all the time.
-No chemistry whatsoever between the two characters. Samantha Morton looked mortified to have to kiss Ciaran Hinds in the kissing scenes. Frankly, I'd be mortified too.

Avoid this version as well as the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg versions- don't let your curiosity to see another version of Jane Eyre get the best of you. They're both awful. See the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson versions instead.",1.0
"This series reminds me of a very poorly written 3rd grade play! Props ie:walls shudder when doors are shut,, you can see the shadow of the boom above the ""actors"" etc. It was bad enough to try and get through this poorly written plot - you also have to put up with a lot of the scenes in episode one in black and white. Whoever said that ""if you love Downton Abby, you'll love this"" was sadly mistaken! Characters come and go from scene to scene and their absence is noted in passing conversation. All actors ""overact"" except for maybe ""Sarah"" and Rose.
Definitely not worth the price, had I known I would not have purchased it.",1.0
"I hated this version of Jane Eyre - it's just wrong in so many ways.  First, while I would agree that most of the actors are well cast, and Samantha Morton is a very apt Jane Eyre, I was incredibly disappointed in Ciaran Hinds.  He is horribly, horribly miscast and, as a result, I have no idea what Jane finds to love in his angry, ranting, flat, and one-dimensional characterization of Rochester.  There's no brooding sadness, no playful charm; he's just abusive and selfish and mean the whole film.

Also, the adaptation is severely lacking in purpose and sacrifices the important themes and relationships that Bronte crafted so well in an attempt to cater to our short attention spans and our desire for cookie cutter romance.  Moments are changed or left out completely, for no apparent reason, creating situations that make no sense (i.e. why does she go home to see Mrs. Reed before she dies? We never find out.) Some scenes are just creepy - like when Mr. Rochester is lustfully stroking her hand after she puts out the fire in his room - very disturbing.  And the dialog has been changed and modernized making the whole thing seem like a bad soap opera.  Please don't insult my intelligence!!!

But the worst aspect of this version is that Jane is not allowed to grow and change and become the independent woman that she needs to be before she can be equal to Rochester and come back to him on her own terms - which is the whole point of the book!  I was actually offended by the ending of the film and felt that throughout Jane is dumbed down and made into a weak, lovesick girl.

The 2006 Masterpiece Theater version is without a doubt the best, followed closely by the Timothy Dalton version.  STAY FAR AWAY from this one.",1.0
"This 1997 TV production is called ""Jane Eyre"", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciarn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciarn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.

Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.

As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: ""I know it may sound silly but...."" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.

This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.

Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like ""I feel that your passions are aroused"" are appropriate for ""Sex in the City"", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.",1.0
"I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.

Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials.",1.0
"This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...
Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.

 The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.
 Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.

If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!

However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining...",1.0
"This version was awfully butchered.  It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel.  The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's ""punch"" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.

I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.",1.0
"This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!

It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.

But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.

Don't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.

Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.

In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!

There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to ""The governess,""while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!

The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.

In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:

""So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?"" sneers Rochester.

""I found someone who wanted to marry me."" again, the self-satisfied smile.

Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.",1.0
"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'",1.0
"Ever since I first read Jane Eyre years ago, it has been one of my favorite books, with its complex characters and wonderful writing.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie, however, was either completely unfamiliar with the book or thought they could do a better job than Charlotte Bronte.  Virtually none of the dialogue is from the book, and when they do keep something (like Rochester's wonderful line about the string connecting him to Jane), it's butchered.  If I weren't already familiar with the plot (or, rather, with how the plot should be), I would've been very confused by the choppiness of this movie, especially towards the end.  For example, Jane hears Rochester calling her name, the next minute she's in a carriage, and the next minute she's at Thornfield.  Wow, that was fast!

Jane's stay with St. John (who is much too nice in his proposal to her) and Diana is reduced to about five minutes, and her aunt's death is completely skipped over.  No mention at all is made of Jane's inheritance from her uncle, or of her family connections to the Rivers family.  Oh, and when Jane and Rochester go shopping in town, they run into Blanche Ingram, for some inexplicable reason.  Of course no movie can keep everything from the book, but this one simply butchered the plot.

And it butchered the characters as well.  Rochester is not supposed to continually bellow and snarl at Jane in the way Ciaran Hinds does in this movie.  (He was such a good Wentworth in Persuasion, I think the fault must lie with the director and script -- very disappointing.)  Nor is Rochester supposed to be a lust-crazed maniac who yells at Jane when she's leaving him, ""You want me!  I can feel your passions are aroused!  Say you want me!  SAY IT!""  He literally bellows at Jane all through this scene -- like when he shouts, ""Didn't I just know you'd desert me!  Really, Jane, you are SO PREDICTABLE!  Couldn't you be just a little more original?!...You're just a child who has NO IDEA WHAT REAL LOVE IS!""  And I use the capital letters because that's how the lines were spoken -- or rather, screamed.  It was impossible to see why any woman in her right mind would fall in love with this Rochester!  This aspect of the film, along with the awful script, made it difficult for me to finish watching the movie.

As for Samantha Morton, she was generally all right, but she overplays the spirited, independent part of Jane's character to the point of being downright rude to Rochester from time to time.  Still, at least her performance was less painful to watch than Ciaran Hinds'.  To summarize, the script and plot bore virtually no resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's original, and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester was a snarling bully, making this movie almost laughably bad.

If you want a good adapatation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  Yes, Dalton is too handsome to be a good Rochester physically, but more important than that is his performance, which shows the many facets of Rochester's personality -- not just non-stop anger.  The plot is kept intact (including the famous gypsy scene, which is omitted from this movie), and almost all of the dialogue is straight from the book.  I'll have to re-read the book and re-watch that adaptation of it to purge this movie from my memory!",1.0
"I am so disappointed that they made my timeless book into this crappy movie.  If I knew they would make this bad of a movie out of my book, I would not have written it!  This was the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre EVER!!!!!  There was NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Edwards.  It was painful to watch them kiss, I'm not kidding!  The only good actress in the whole movie was Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Fairfax and is from Sense and Sensibility.  It is definetly a made for TV movie, and should have never been made into a DVD...if you prefer watching made for TV movies then you'll like it.  I recommend either the 1996 version or the 1944 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen.  This version misses all the important parts, quickly runs through her childhood, and skips her Aunt's death.  There is no emotion in this movie and it has no suspense at all.  Trust me, don't rent or watch it!!  I hope this was helpful.",1.0
"I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.

First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.

Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.",1.0

Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing.  I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't.  I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD.",1.0

"The screenwriting for this particular adaptation took extreme liberties, not with the events (which is to be expected) but the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester. I assume the liberties were taken in order to make the characters more palatable to modern tastes and philosophies. A pity the writer could not trust the original material to convey the story.",1.0
"When I found out that A&E had come out with a movie version of my favorite book I was overjoyed. I enjoyed their versions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma. I was very dissapointed in their production of Jane Eyre. Key scenes were either altered, removed, or just poorly done. The entire gypsy scene was gone. How this major scene could possibly been taken out with thoughts that it would not be missed is beyond me.
This was a wonderful book but a bad movie when the two are compared. If you have not read the book then maybe you won't care about the ""alterations"", but I promise you that this is one of the greatest books ever written and will not be dissapointed by investing the extra time and effort of actually picking up a copy and reading it.",1.0
"This adaptation of the marvelous novel ""Jane Eyre"" was an absolute punishment to watch. Such artistic liberties were taken with the characters in this film as to render them virtually unrecognizable. I can't recall any of the dialogue that was actually true to the book, and this was very disappointing as the strength of the story lies in the voices of the characters. I have no doubt that Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds would have done a marvelous job in their roles, were it not for the horrid writing and equally horrid direction. Mr. Rochester is so continually flying into a rage over something or other, that one wonders how Jane ever could have tolerated his company. And Jane speaks her mind in a much more opinionated and argumentative way then Charlotte Bronte ever allowed her to in the book. I also wonder why some of the most important scenes were completely ignored. Basically all of Jane's childhood is passed over in about 5 minutes, and thus the foundation of Jane's character cannot be truly understood. Also, the deathbed scene of Aunt Reed, and all the particulars of that family were passed over. And the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy, one of the most revealing and pivotal scenes in the story, was completely excluded. I would not recommend this film to anyone who has never read the book, as it simply does not do it justice. I also would not recommend it to any true lovers of this tale, as it is more likely to frustrate than to entertain.",1.0
"I am a Jane Eyre fanatic, so it is with experience that I can say. . . this movie is not worth the time. I own the BBC and 1997 verse and those are the only two I could ever recommend(the BBC verse is the best). There is NOTHING about Mr Rochester's character that is appealing. In fact, they make him far to angry and unpleasent than he should be. The book portrays a broken man. For that reason, women are drawn to him. Not even in the most climaxtic scene am I convinced that he is truely in need of love. The whole movie felt cold and unfeeling!",1.0
"why the screenwriter decided to ditch all the most famous dialogue and many of the most pivotal scenes in this extremely pedestrian ""Jane Eyre"". All lost are the Aunt's deathbed confession to Jane, the buddha-like teachings of Helen in the hellish Lowood school, the gypsy fortune telling scene that infuriates Blanche Ingram, and even the chestnut tree cleft in half as a manifestation of God's displeasure! No sign either of ""He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black""--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!!
I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in ""Persuasion"", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.
Please, if you have never seen ""Jane Eyre"", don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel. Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine did such a better job of it!",1.0
"Rochester has been one of my all time favorite heroes. Jane Eyre one of my all time favorite books and heroines. I read it almost yearly.
I am a fan of Ciaran Hinds (believe it or not). After seeing him in Ivanhoe, where he brought such a wonderful wounded, smokey edge to Gilbert, I remarked to a friend of mine, ""wouldn't he just be the penultimate Rochester?"" I was thrilled to find out shortly thereafter that this was going to be the case. Wow!!! I couldn't wait to see it.
And then I did.
What were the director and the scriptwriters thinking? After such a subtle moving proformance in Ivanhoe, Mr Hinds turns Rochester into a strutting, bellowing, obnoxious bully. Eu[...] Our Jane would NOT want this jerk. I was embarressed for him! Not to mention disappointed and sad for such a missed opportunity with this production.
The actress who played Jane did it passably well but still no great shakes.
And *where* did the writers get this dialogue? Did they have any clue what the book was about, or did they do the Cliff Notes and then write the screenplay, 'spicing' things up a little, just because? ....
If you haven't seen any productions of JE, spare yourself this one. Instead look for the one with Timothy Dalton, or with George C. Scott.",1.0
"Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favorite stories, so I have leapt at the chance to see every  version ever filmed.
I was particularly anxious to see this one, produced by A&E, because, in my mind, they have a  deserved reputation for accuracy and for quality productions.  I have to  say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only  because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the  portrayals of the lead characters.  In particular, the actor playing Mr.  Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose,  offensive man.  (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the  director).  It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane  could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly  in love with him!
The most accurate and well-acted version of this  wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version.  (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production  because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from  the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version  is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's ""script,"" and the  performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely  superb!  It is the ONLY version which I've purchased for my collection; I  have also purchased three other copies to give as gifts to friends for  their viewing pleasure, and they agree that Dalton and Clarke ARE Rochester  and Jane!",1.0
"I read Jane Eyre for the first time at the age of 15. Over the years I have eagerly watched every filmed version as they appeared. I previously thought the Orson Welles version was the worst, but I changed my mind once  I saw this. The BEST film of Jane Eyre is the Susannah York/George C. Scott  version, done in the early 1970's for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Wonderful in  every way!! Unfortunately, not available yet on video. AVOID this version  from A&E, it is truly terrible. Ciaran Hinds plays Mr. Rochester as a  loud, bullying, scenery-chewing lout, and I have seldom seen a shallower,  more pallid performance as Jane. Skip this movie and re-read the novel!",1.0

"We love this TV series, and my wife was very excited when I gave her this complete set of the entire series for Christmas. Two episodes and untold bouts of frustration later, we are ready to return it and get our money back, all because of the idiotic default programming that I assume was created by Acorn. From the main menu, if you click ""Play,"" you find that the default setting to play the video is with English subtitles. The audio is already in English, so these subtitles would be useful only for the hearing-impaired. Why would a setting for the hearing-impaired be the default in the first place?

So you just go to the setup menu and change the setting to ""no subtitles,"" right? Wrong! It's almost impossible. There seems to be no way to return to the main menu unless you turn the DVD player completely off, remove the DVD, turn the machine back on, re-insert the DVD, and then hit play -- and even that doesn't always work. At one point I completely removed the DVD and turned off the equipment; yet when I restarted it, the DVD resumed playing again where it left off; subtitles and all.

I finally did get the subtitles turned off for Episode One after over 30 minutes of effort (and I am very equipment-savvy). But on playing the second disc we discovered the same problem: ""subtitles on"" is the default. For the third disc, I turned the subtitles off from the main menu before hitting ""Play,"" but it didn't take -- the disc still reverted to ""subtitles on."" After finally getting the subtitles turned off for that disc (and I still am not sure why it finally worked); I decided to take the time to go through all the discs and change the setting to ""subtitles off"" so we wouldn't have to worry about it again -- but before wasting any more time, I figured I'd better check the first disc again, just to make sure the setting was still ""subtitles off."" Incredibly, it had reverted to the default of ""subtitles on"" -- so, even if you do turn off subtitles, you have to do it again every single time you play the disc!!

My wife really loves the series and has decided to keep them and just endure the subtitles. But I will never watch them, and I will NEVER buy another DVD produced by Acorn!",1.0

"Before I begin my review of the product, I would like to share something I think UpDown fans will chuckle at:

The other day I was watching an UpDown episode in which Miss Elizabeth joins the suffragettes and Rose is sent to Holloway prison. In one scene, one of the other jailed suffragettes attacks Rose, who falls against the wall.  I noticed how the wall moved (quite a bit); it looked to be made out of cardboard!

The 25 year Anniversary Special is very well done and very interesting.

Now for the review:

I would assume that some reading this have the series on VHS and want to upgrade to DVD.  My advice is: DON'T.  These DVDs were not remastered at all; I don't care what the description says.  The DVD set is no better than the VHS. The beginning intro (the music and cartoons from Punch magazine) is cut off in several episodes. There are numerous episodes where the tape (thus the DVD) jumped and the picture is momentarily distorted.  Images are fuzzy and the colors are off.

My last advice is if you can wait, wait a couple of years when it is the 40th anniversary of the series.  No doubt remastered digital DVDs will be produced at that time as most films are on anniversaries.

PBS will offer a few NEW episodes of ""UpDown"" in April 2011; Jean Marsh reprises the role of Rose Buck working for the new family at Eaton Place. I have heard rumors that new episodes are already being filmed, so popular was the new series.

"It goes without saying that ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled ""Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?"" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson ""Miss Marple""s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.",1.0

George Washington was VERY opposed to swearing.  He was known to punish his men if they swore.  SO WHY does Jeff Daniels swear like a sailor in this film.  It might have been good if the writers had not used such foul language.  George Washington would have been appalled to view this! BAD FORM A&E.  You could have done so much better!,1.0
"The portrayal of Washington was so contrary to what we can know of the real man from his own personal writings and from that which was written of him by his contemporaries that watching it aroused in me anger and sadness.  I originally bought this movie in order to select a 30 minute clip of this relevant Christmastime topic to show to my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The foul language made it undesirable from the beginning. But worse, was that the writer, director or actor must not have bothered researching the person of George Washington. He would not have taken the name of the Lord in vain and did not even allow his men to swear. He was known to have impeccable manners, yet this movie has him loudly belittling General Henry Knox, in front the troops, for being overweight! This was supposed to be the funny part of the movie, I suppose; making fun of a great American hero who, one year earlier, was responsible for the British evacuation of Boston after having captured 59 canon and mortars from Fort Ticonderoga and bringing them 300 miles in the worst of weather to General Washington.

Jeff Daniels played Washington with no personality whatsoever. He was expressionless throughout the movie! Impatient, rude, snide - yes. But void of positive character traits. Washington was made to look like an imbalanced, foolish man. In real life, no one would have put such a person in a position of  leadership or would have followed him. There was NOTHING admirable or endearing about Daniels' portrayal of this revered American founder.

The saddest part of all of this is that the Amazon star rating here shows that most Americans have not studied history enough to realize what was so grossly wrong with this movie",1.0
The first ten to fifteen minutes of this movie had so much cursing in it our Family could not finish it. This movie IS A VERY POOR PORTRAYAL of George Washington's character!

"Just saw The Crossing tonight.  I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan.  I thought the scenery and costumes were great, battle recreations great, but as a whole the film fell short.  Numerous historical inaccuracies and important omissions, and a seeming obsession to make sure we knew that every character in the plot was a bawdy-talking, cussing, irreverent man of the world.  It was really over the top.  No way will I show this to my kids; not just that the cussing is excessive, but it's probably historically inaccurate and the portrayal certainly unbalanced.  In fact, at times the course language seemed to become the main POINT of the film rather than the historical significance of what was happening.  And we know from numerous histories and accounts written at the time by eyewitnesses that even though Washington had a bad temper, he restrained it and only used curse words on rare occasions (historical accounts indicate the shock by his staff when he cursed out Gen. Charles Lee at the Battle of Monmouth, because it was so uncharacteristic of him to use foul language and he actually ordered his soldiers not to do so).

Historical inaccuracies and important omissions abound: After the battle, Washington orders a retreat back across the Delaware; in reality, the army stayed in NJ and laid another trap for the British which ended up in a follow-up victory at Princeton.  And the attack on Trenton also included a planned second crossing that never materialized, adding drama that this film ignored.

On top of that, Daniels' portrayal of Washington seemed off compared to what you read by men of the time, including the soldiers who fought with him.  He was known as a hard man, but a also a gentleman much loved by those around him (other than the ambitious would-be usurpers); but in The Crossing, he just comes across as a hard man, and at times a jerk.  It was not a portrayal that seemed credible--who would follow this guy into battle?

Finally, and perhaps worst, we end with a totally fictional bit of ideological, PC revisionism when American Gen. Nathaniel Greene scolds Washington for his idealism, reminding him that the Revolution is all about the Colonists' greed, which Greene says is no different than that of the Hessians.  What??  That was the last straw for me.

The Crossing isn't a good history lesson at all, other than the outdoor scenes.

"TV History reveals new and fascinating facts, either hitherto unknown, or previously ignored.

Viewers are informed, twice, that at least two general officers in the Continental Army shaved with cold water, one of them being the army's commander-in-chief.

While Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton became legendary for his hospitality, and especially for the generous helpings served to guests on a groaning dinner table. His expertise in carving a roast may have originated years earlier in a small cabin on the outskirts of Trenton, New Jersey, where the inventor of American banking put aside his duties as colonel of artillery to slice up a half dozen Hessians.

Colonel Rall, commanding the Germans, certainly took his time getting dressed for work. All those enemy troops storming past his bedroom window don't seem to have distracted him from getting his necktie on straight.

By contrast, Colonel Glover is portrayed as somewhat of a fashion emergency. And at the pivotal conference prior to the Battle of Trenton, he makes a scattered, rambling, speech on wig etiquette.

Among the hardships suffered by the Continental Army's rank-and-file, a shortage of pipe tobacco appears to be a close runner-up to the shoe shortage: They're reduced to toking up cornsilk.

Bookseller turned ballistics expert Henry Knox is relegated to comic relief, a sort of Oliver Hardy in period costume.

And those poor Hessians can't seem to escape the slur that they were hung-over on duty. Not much truth to this, ditto for the ""mercenary"" label these hapless losers can't seem to shake. When it comes down to it, they were shanghaied. But never mind, movies are about entertainment. Whoever choreographed their antics must have had a sense of humor: With those outlandish uniforms, they pass for Keystone Cops. And the extras really seem to enjoy hamming it up.

After an hour and a half of loopy dialogue and low-budget props, I did manage to score a few laughs. But wait. Something was missing. This film was shot up in Canada. So why isn't there any snow and ice? Wasn't that the whole thing about Trenton? The harrowing night march and daring assault in the dead of Winter?

There is a redeeming moment. Reality intrudes when one of Washington's staff suggests that all wars are basically about money. The famously stony Father of His Country nods in grudging agreement.",1.0
"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.

One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?""  ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States.

The Americans walk unopposed into Trenton and even have time to set up their cannons and place their troops just right.

"The one star is for the blu-ray edition of this movie, not for the movie itself (which otherwise I consider to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen).

The blu-ray edition is too grainy and has very bad color saturation and low contrast. Worst of all, the digital scenes of air combat with Soviet (Ukrainian) jet fighters are just horrible: blurred sores on screen.

It is a shame that an otherwise fine film like this was released in Blu-ray without making the necessary upgrades to ensure that some scenes would not look like crap when viewed in high definition.

SPOILER (although, how can you spoil this piece of rotten fruit any more?)

"I like Harrison Ford, a lot.  I grew up with the man as Han Solo & Indiana Jones, but since The Fugitive, can anyone name me ONE decent performance he's been in? Anyone? Anyone? Thats right, he's really not much of an actor.  And shamefully the talented Gary Oldman, Glenn Close,  and Jurgen Prochnow are not allowed to show off their skills.

The plot (Air Force One being hijacked by Russian terrorists) seems easy enough.  However, the linchpin of the whole plot is completely ignored, thereby invalidating the whole movie.  For the terrorist plot to succeed, it is completely dependent on one of the secret service agents to be a traitor.  Did he do it for money? power? sex? a good chocolate milkshake?  We'll never know because they don't bother to mention it!  So we're supposed to accept that a president will run around Air Force One beating up terrorists, but a secret service agent who would have to endure YEARS of training, screening, and background checks would turn on the commander-in-chief with no good explanation?  Also do we really want a president who would consider the life of his family over the well-being of the nation?  I know that sounds cruel, but that's THE JOB!

I do not expect reality from movies, in fact when done right fantasy is a great genre.  However, this movie obviously is trying to have SOME basis in reality.  So if you're going to construct a film that has to have some realistic factors, isn't worth time to review the script to make sure it even makes sense?  THIS is primary point of my critique.

I don't feel any possible political leanings are to be drawn from the film.  You're really supposed to shut your brain off, eat popcorn, and feel good about the ole U.S.A..  So should you want another overly melodramatic, cliched, bad leading man 2-hour crapfest, that's your choice.  Please just don't consider it a good one...",1.0

"This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written. It's so fake and it would never happen.

Harrison Ford is the president and he's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman. He's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close. Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.

The movie is so fake it's sad. The plane would have been destroyed by pressure. It gets laced with 100's of rounds of ammo. Come on you have to make is somewhat believable. Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.

Glen Close is horrible. Her dramatics are over the top. The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid. We don't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb. It's so fake.

The refueling plane blowing up is dumb. There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that. You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it's not.

Russia would never give up dangerous men either. They'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun don't shine.

This movie is way to fake. I couldn't enjoy it because it would never happen. I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it. The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked. The cast and talents are wasted. Why this made so much money I don't know. I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1.0
"On this derivative, by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president (played by Harrison Ford) could actually take down a russian (what else?) group of terrorists, as if he was 007 or McGyver. The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible, but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations, a lame and predictable plot and wooden, tepid acting. There are some twists, but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through, given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the ""good"" guys always win. Despite some competent action sequences, this is brain-dead, mind-numbing material, cartoonish at best and completly disposable. There`s no force to be found here.",1.0
"I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.
Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.
Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.
I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.
I think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere....

Guns blasting everywhere in an airplane? It was also *needlessly* violent with execution-style scenes. Glenn Close was wasted mostly acting like an indecisive babbler.

"Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, Spice World is a grossly lacking film, even for those who enjoy the music. Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.

Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.

Since the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.

While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.

With brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.

"Compared to '97's other action smashes Con Air and Tommorow Never Dies , this meandering nonsense is the definable example of studio overbearing. It's slightly better than Face/Off maybe,but it still very poor. The action itself is slow moving and uninvolving,and nothing that hasn't been done ten times better and to more exciting effect in earlier highjack features like Passenger 57 and Under Siege. Harrison Ford is nauseatingly mundane,routine in his leading man role,doing the usual mumbling act he's done in previous action roles. He's showing his age really badly too (but he still should have got the role as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears instead of Ben Affleck,dagnammit!)Meanwhile,Gary Oldman is laughably OTT as the rashan terrorist ,while Glen Close and William H. Macy are totally wasted in their roles. The story itself is completely unbelievable and insults the viewer's intelligence beyond breaking point. For one example out of many others,in one scene,Ford uses a mobile phone to make contact with Close and we all know that in real life,this would cause the plane to crash. And towards the end,it doesn't half drag on like anything,just when I thought this dire mess was coming to and end,it just went on more and more until I was close to just turning it off and walking out. For an impressive instance of Ford's action man status,check out his turns as Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. And sign a petition to get him as the lead in the new film,not Aptless Affleck.",1.0
"This movie never really appealled to me when it first came out a while back. I thought it would be an alarmingly patriotic and gung-ho affair with little thought for anyone outside of the US, with the amount of disbelief needing to be suspended astronomical. Having only recently seen it on terrestrial television, I can say that I was absolutely right.
Harrison Ford plays the President with his usual rigid sub-Schwarzenneger style, utterly emotionless and unbelievable as always. Glenn Close hams along as a cringe-inducingly patriotic vice president, with some of the most cliched and predictable lines ever. Gary Oldman is a little better, but still plays a stereotypical hollywood villian who engages in just about every deadly sin possible in this movie.
Wolfgang Petersen fails to engage the watcher or bring about any of the sweaty claustrophobia present in his previous epic, Das Boot. Even In The Line Of Fire questioned the all-American dream and morals, partly because of the presence of the brilliant John Malkovich. This film doesn't. At all.

"Spiceworld: The Movie is a movie starring the Spice Girls.

What....you want a plot? Sorry, there just isn't one. Well, nothing that could be coherently described as a plot, anyway. The target audience of this movie won't realize this, but what we get is a collection of music videos very very loosely tied together around a number of dismal subplots.

To give you some idea of the looseness of the subplots, some of them involved;

A snooty bumbling reporter, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) filming a documentary on the ""real"" Spice Girls. He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.

A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.

An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).

A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.

A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.

A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.

Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.

The movie also featured a bus with a Union Jack plastered all over it which was the Spiceworld tour bus. They must have put Dr Who's Tardis somewhere in this bus, since it was an awful lot bigger inside than outside, but never mind about that. Meatloaf drove the bus.",1.0
"What a roller coaster ride of a movie. I say this not because it had me at the edge of my seat with excitement but because it made me vomit allover myself. Wow, where do I even begin? Ok how about this? You know how a movie can be so bad that in a way its actually kind of good. Well this movie was so bad that it just flew past that point quicker than Rick James' heartbeat after a 4 day coke binge, and then went back around full circle to being just plan horrible.

I don't know how this can even be characterized as a movie because a movie requires a plot of some kind. I could have taken a blank piece of paper. Conjured up the biggest loogie that I could possibly make. One with a small solid chunk in it and with a nice faint yellowish hue. Spit it on the paper and have made a better script then the one used in this movie. There must have been something wrong with either the tape I was viewing or my VCR, because about halfway through, the picture fluttered and the screen went blue for about 7mins. I witnessed more plot turns and more character development in this 7min span of blue screen, then I did throughout the whole rest of the movie.

This movie left me so violated that at the ending credits I felt like a preschooler leaving the Never Land Ranch after a week long slumber party. At one point I just couldn't take anymore. I tried to stand and walk to the TV to shut it off, but I was so mentally and physically exhausted from viewing this movie that I couldn't even make it to my feet. Watching this movie required the use of muscles that I don't usually use on a regular basis. My body actually physically ached with soreness for 3 days after viewing this sick joke of a film. During one of the musical montages I sincerely feared that my brain cells may try to euthanize themselves to avoid enduring this torture any longer. The extent of psychological damage this movie has caused me is immeasurable. I now have recurring Nam flashbacks and I didn't even fight in Nam. Sometimes I'll just start weeping out of the blue like when Richard Simmons consoles a grossly overweight woman. I developed a drinking habit. I lost my job. All the hopes and dreams I once had are now lost, just like the fat from around Jarrids' midsection, all because of ""Spice World""

Director Bob Spiers should receive a beating so bad that The Gooch wouldn't even unleash it upon Arnold Jackson, for recording these ghastly events on film. If the spermaceti that was responsible for producing Bob Spiers knew that he would later go on to make this movie. It would have screamed out kamikaze and took a fatal dive into the sticky mucus lining of the fallopian tubes, instead of fertilizing the egg. Just think about how destructive, to the whole human race, Spice World can be. This next statement may sound very farfetched but in all likelihood it's not completely inconceivable. God forbid this would ever happen, but for a moment just imagine that all intelligent life on this planet was eradicated by some sort of plague. Now imagine that after hundreds of thousands of years a new race were to discover our planet and start studying who we were and how we lived. Imagine how they would marvel at some of our discoveries and inventions. They would be mesmerized by the huge skyscrapers we erected. Our knowledge of medicine, electricity, the automobile, the computer, and the family size George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reduceing Grilling Machine with bun warmer. They would be awed by some of our great poets, artists and philosophers. Just imagine what they would learn from us. Imagine the respect and admiration they would have for us. That is until one of them were to unearth ""Spice World"". The respect they once had for our hole race would be taken back faster than a bowl of cereal from Trix The Rabbit. Where we were once hailed as kings we would now be reduced to nothing more than the butts of their jokes like blondes, the Polish and Janet Jacksons' Nipple. All because of ""Spice World"".

What's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.

Yes, every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747, but what we have here is a President who's a  master of armed and unarmed combat; an Avionics Engineer -  a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation. We can also add: the perfect, caring and reassuring father and husband; maybe, we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.

This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you're not impressed with that, we also see him standing upright on the plane's wing.

Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often, his  acting is becoming banal, predictable and synthetic; it's almost as if he doesn't believe in his character anymore - he's simply bored by the  monotonous, one-dimensional, stereotyped role of the baddie.

As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P. - she should know better. The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst, anticipation, anxiety and, finally, overwhelming relief and joy...... it was cringingly awful.

Somehow, I can't help but think, that those viewers who raved  about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for  conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner.",1.0

"A cop's partner is killed, and poor Richard feels he has to go and take care of the bad guy that did it.  Richard's wife has left him and he now is divorced, so Kim, who is a white slave of the bad guy, ads more reason for Richard to go after the bad guy.  Besides, Kim was there when Richard's partner was done in.
THE GOOD
Not much, Kim Bassinger is pretty to look at, and that is about it.
THE BAD
Richard and Kim along with rest of the cast, seem to be going thru the motions of acting.  Richard has the same blank stare that he has in most of his moves.  Living close to New Orleans, they did not take advantage of the local landscape.  This movie could have been filmed anywhere.  They do not know how to eat Crawfish in the movie, a southern treat. The Final fight scene is poorly shot.

"My whole life (I'm over 50) I've read about how great this movie was supposed to be. I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.

I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.

After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself ""I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act"" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.

The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.

Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.

This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.

The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.

I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.

Recommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, ""opinion's are like ........ everybody has one.""",1.0

"The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.

It seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.

There is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the ""trip"" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.

As I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.

There is a parade in the next town. Do they have a permit? They meet a local character in the jail. Will he go to the Mardi Gras? Is there another society that is highly evolved? Is this just pretentious babbling to pad out the movie? They stop at a small town. People make comments, and they leave. Will somebody come after them? They arrive at that house of blue light. Then they go to the Mardi Gras to see even stranger sights. We see a New Orleans cemetery (people are buried in vaults). The picture drags on as they pass around a bottle. The scenes suggest intoxication. They leave the next morning. ""We blew it."" Then there is an end to their journey due to an accidental meeting with a pick-up truck.

"This movie is offensive in the same way that any movie that is truly about hippies would have to be. What that meens is this movie does not consist of the typical slapstick hippie stereo type that we usually get in stupid cartoons. This shows hippies for what they are, degenerates, and at the same time it demonizes the south. For a hippie, this movie would seem to be a moral statement, but to me it just seems to show how awful people can be. Shame on hippies for being , lazy, pot smoking, anti-establishment degenerates. But shame on the south too, for being filled with such hatred. But while I'm sure there are some people in the south that would have no problem shooting hipppies on spot for no apparent reason other than that they looked funny, I can't help but feel that the south were exagerated to certain extent. In conclusion though, this movie was enjoyable . I don't know why, but it was. I guess its just a very amusing look into the late 60s (something thats usually sugarcoated)from the ""other side"" lol. i would like to rate it higher, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

"This is another work of liberal propoganda from the sixtys

designed to encourage children to turn on their country,

drop out and use drugs.

The story (if you can call it that) has two drug dealers riding

motorcycles across the american west.  They are smuggling drugs

the whole way.  Its less a movie than a music video because

nobody in the film can really act.  Endless motocycle panoramas

set to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene

where our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and

mock the idea of religion.

The film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.  That

Americans who work, have families, have jobs, are clean and

don't do drugs sit around all day plotting how to kill everyone

else.  Its always news to them, but real Americans are far too

busy working and living their lives to care much about what

a bunch of deadbeats are up to.

Peter Fonda spends the whole film in love with himself.  I can

imagine after every take him pulling out a mirror and grooming

himself.  The other guy (Hopper) is a dirtball.  He must have

been out of it nearly the whole time because they go out of their

way to reduce his lines down to nothing.  Nicholson is the only

person in the movie who can half-way act, and at best he gives

a B-grade supporing character actor performance.

And by hippie-liberal logic, since Nicolson is the only actor

here, he gets the least screen time and gets killed off real

quick.  As is always the case under socialism, the punishment

for showing that your better than other people is severe.

At the end of the film, our druggie heros get shot to death

out on the road by regular america for no reason.  The day

before they get shot, Fonda tells the dirty guy ""we blew it""

forshadowing that they were going to be punished and killed.

By liberal logic, Hopper and Fonda blew it (and brought death

on themselves) because as noble as liberals consider drug

smuggling, it also could be considered work.  Work for

these kind of guys is the ultimate crime against nature.

This film and its two dirtballs turn the concept of freedom

around.  Freedom was never about freedom from work or freedom

to use lots of drugs.  Freedom is about opportunity, not

being a parasite.",1.0

So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.

There are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these ""womanly"" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.

Why this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of ""Feminist Film"" courses is beyond me.",1.0
"Excited. Popped it in the DVD player. Opening sequence, perfect. Scene 2, no audio. Scene 3&4, had audio. Scene 5, no audio. DVD is clean and unscratched, unclear why audio is spotty. Had to return the DVD to Amazon.

**UPDATE: I recieved a replacement that had the exact same issue - that points toward fauts in the production batch. I'm saying that people should be cautious about buying this DVD from Amazon, at least for the moment. Unless, of course, you enjoy: closed captioning, lip reading, or returning DVDs to Amazon.",1.0

"This movie really borders on absurd. The play was simple, heart-felt and centered more on the goings on in the beauty salon. This movie is so overproduced that it diminishes the story and the performances.  Sally  Field gives a credible performance. Shirley McLaine and Olympia Dukakis  play their characters like a cartoon. And Dolly Parton proves she is really  sweet but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  As for Julia  Roberts...well she has screen presence, but she just can't act.

"With  'Close Encounters', simply surviving the opening scenes at Roy and Ronnie Neary's home, with their psycho-children doing as they wish, with no one acting as an adult - Ronnie, presumably, solely a baby-breeder, and Roy the uncontrolled sperm - who doesn't want the script have these wretched people taken away by aliens - forever.  (Did Terri Garr ever get to portray a woman anyone could stand being around).

Top world-scientists surrounded by computers, and slide rules,  have to rip a large globe from its pedestal in order fix latitude and longitude?  Now, there's a piece of needless and embarrassing  action.

I like the concept of the film.  I like that it is mathematics, including music, that creates a universal language..  It is reasonable that, as portrayed, the government would do everything in its power to deny the arrival of extra-terrestrials, not because I believe they exist, but because governments are historically fearful of a knowledgeable public.

Even on the VHS tape of this movie, there is an interview following the movie.  Just why would there not have been air conditioning brought in to the hangar in Alabama, so that the crew and actors were not sweltering.  What was the point?  I mean, they went to India.  This is why I can't even be an extra.  I'm working.  I get fed.  I don't get exposed to conditions that could land me in the hospital.  This is all very sado-masochistic.  Very unnecessary.

In 1977 these special effects with all the electronics activating themselves and the giant spaceship coming down must of been earth shattering but viewed now it is a slow, disjointed mess. I know the guy playing the Frenchman is a legendary director but having the character be French means nothing, and is especially confusing to follow. Why is a French UFO hunter investigating missing American WWII planes? What?!? It goes on from the as we transition from one drawn out scene to the next. The characters are all flat, Dreyfuss is underwhelming and after his encounter, he has visions which cause his wife and family to split. I never cared about any of the characters, they were one dimensional and stereotypical. It just goes on too long. This is a slow plodding film with no rhyme or reason that just doesn't hold up. Save yourself 2 and 1/2 hours and skip this. After Jaws, Spielberg was the it boy and they gave him carte blanche and he gave them an alien encounter movie. He did much better with E.T. but this one not so much.",1.0

I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting ""If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?"" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.
I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this.

Woman loses her son to UFO. Both go to Devil's Tower to find the UFOs and aliens. Government says there is poisonous gas. There is no poisonous gas. Guy and woman find UFOs and aliens. Nothing happens.

Are you kidding me? This is a plot? And why do people give it 4 and 5 star ratings? What do you see that I don't? I am actually kind of a sci-fi fan, I like some of Spielberg's later movies (ET, Jurassic Park, A.I.), but this one? No way. It is just plain silly.",1.0

Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me.

If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you'll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.  Apparently in Steven Spielberg's mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)

The best thing about this movie is that it ends (sadly after 6 1/2 hours of people climbing on mountains and staring into the sky).  Photosynthesis is more fun to watch than this movie.  He's lost his skills since Star Wars.",1.0

However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy.",1.0

Movie is fantastic;  Blu-ray had multiple defects throughout the movie,1.0

Terribly grainy and back noise :(,1.0
"The film  ""Close Encounters"" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.
This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.
However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg?
Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future. What a pity. I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original.
Be patient and stay tuned...but don't buy yet!",1.0

Lisa's bear Corduroy gets lost in the laundromat.  Lisa looks for him but the manager must close up for the night.  Then Corduroy goes on his adventures.  It's a very good picture book for children 3-6.,5.0
"In this installment of Corduroy's adventures with Lisa, we see that some time has passed since she first brought him home from the department store.  She's taller, wearing her hair a little straighter, and her mom looks like she had a makeover, too.  Corduroy, however, is wearing the same green overalls he did in the first book and has managed to keep both buttons on this time.  Early on in the book, however, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket, and in the search for one gets separated from Lisa and her mom while they are in the laundromat.  They leave without him, setting him up for a meeting with a friendly stranger who washes his overalls for him, as well as encounters with such laundromat staples as powder detergent and pushcarts.
As in the first book, Lisa comes back for him the next day, and once again her needle and thread come to the rescue.
This book and ""Corduroy"" are the only two Corduroy books my daughter and I have read.  I wonder if there are others, and what kind of sartorial splendor Corduroy will be arrayed in next if the trend continued!",5.0
"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills.  With better parent-child bonding from reading,  you child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to  others.  Intellectual performance will expand as well.  Spending time  together watching television fails as a substitute.
To help other  parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our  youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were  read to her as a young child.  A Pocket for Corduroy was one of her picks.  Since the story is well summarized here at Amazon.com, I would like to  focus on why the story is an important one to share.
First, Lisa is shown  as being not such a young child.  Yet she carries her teddy bear, Corduroy,  with her openly.  No one comments on that, shames her about it, or acts as  though she is doing anything strange.  Children draw great comfort from  familiar objects, teddy bears, blankets, and other stuffed toys.  This book  endorses that connection, overcoming the stalled thinking that children  must quickly become little adults.
Second, Lisa helps her Mother do the  laundry as her primary focus.  That shows a connectedness to her Mother and  the family that is very encouraging for a child.  She can make a  contribution although she is a child.
Third, Lisa makes every attempt to  be responsible about Corduroy.  She tells Corduroy to wait in a chair and  not to move.  She tries to find Corduroy before leaving the laundromat, and  gets her Mother to agree to come back again the next day to find him.  Although she is sad, she overcomes her reluctance to be separated and  leaves.  This suggests that she can and should trust that everything will  turn out all right.  This reinforces an optimism that is good for children  to develop.
Fourth, all of the adults act in responsible ways.  Lisa's  Mother brings her back.  The artist who finds Corduroy in his laundry bag  dries his clothes for him and leaves him where he can easily be found the  next day.  The man who works in the laundry helps Lisa and her Mother find  Corduroy the next day.  This encourages the idea that everyone can and will  help one another.  This is a good role model for children as they imagine  what they should be like as adults.
Fifth, the whole misadventure  relates to Corduroy feeling bereft because he does not have a pocket.  So  Lisa sews one for him, caring for him in a nurturing way even though he is  only a teddy bear.  Caring about others is a great way to feel better about  oneself.
As you can see, the book is filled with optimistic, caring,  considerate human values expressed through the story.  You can reinforce  this by discussing with your child how s/he might care for a favorite  stuffed animal or blanket during an upcoming trip.  This can help reduce  the anxiety caused by concerns about the changes, and assist your child in  being careful so the loved connection is not lost.
You and your child  will feel affirmed and closer after you read and review this story  together.
Overcome your stalled thinking about providing affirmations  to your child with this book!",5.0

A Pocket for Corduroy is a charming addition to anyone's collection. It is a very sweet story about the owner of Corduroy who leaves him in the laundry and has some difficulties retrieving him. Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was.

"One day, Corduroy, a stuffed bear, goes with Lisa, his owner, and her mother to do laundry at the laundromat.  As Lisas mom reminds her to empty her pockets, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket on his overalls and sets out on a search to find one.  What might he find along the way?  Will he wander completely away from Lisa?

This is a sweet and fun book that I think I might like better than the original.  The reason for this is the creativity of what Corduroy runs across in the laundromat and what he thinks it might be.  We, of course, know better, but his guesses make perfect sense from his experiences.  The pictures are wonderful and expertly capture the story.

"I am not a fan of sequels in any form- it seems impossible to top or equal the original. However, I am pleased to report that ""A Pocket for Corduroy"" is a sequel, and a sequel that I enjoyed. I love the urban, hipster setting highlighted by Freeman's warm, real-life details- a woman passing in a sari, hard plastic Laundromat chairs, a box of ""Swan Flakes"" soap chips. And I loved the beret and the name ""Pandro's"" on the Laundromat window- like I said, think: ""beatnik artist"" and it's not like the name on the window was ""Gonzales'""...I've never even have heard of the surname ""Pandro"" (re: previous negative reviewer). No disrespect to others' opinions; it just seems to me that everyone is too sensitive to everything today. Anyway, as you probably know by now, Cord gets left behind at the Laundromat, has a small nighttime adventure involving a dryer ride, a soap waterfall, and being rediscovered by Lisa. So, Lisa sews a pocket on Cord's overalls for him to place his namecard within in case of future loss. Not sappy at all. Read warm, gentle cycle. Copyright 1978.",5.0
I ordered this book for my 4 year old son because it was one of my favorites when I was a child. He loved it!! I highly recommend.,5.0
Great book and we had great fun reading this to our granddaughter and re-discovering Corduroy and his adventures.  Arrived on time and in perfect shape.,5.0
Shipped in great condition.  This was a gift for expecting grandson.  Was a favorite of my daughters and she was very happy,5.0
A great hard cover version of a classic book. The pictures are great.  This version is a good size for story time.,5.0
"My son love this book, and thankfully it came very fast, and the conditions were pristine, thank you very much!",5.0
I found these books and this author years and years ago.  The first is Corduroy and then A Pocket For Corduroy.  What a fun adventure for you and the one you are sharing this story with.  This is now a standard I buy for all baby showers!,5.0
I had this book when I was a little girl and now my daughter loves it too,5.0
"This book was the hit of the baby shower this book was given at.  ALL of the young mothers had forgotten about this book that they had loved themselves as children - so when the gift box with this book was opened...there was so many ooooo's and ahhhhhhhh's that went up from the room for this modern classic.  The book was passed around and everyone had to look at it for just it's nostalgia alone.  So many gals left the baby shower saying they were stopping on their way home to pick the book up to share with their own babies.  Did I mention the honored mommy-to-be LOVED her gift?  Can't go wrong with this book for young ones, no matter their age :)",5.0
"My 2 1/2 year old adores this book. In fact, I have had to make a rule of no more than twice a day. He calls it the ""laundry book"". I must disagree about the caged bear scene being frightening. My son specifically requests the caged bear scene and is obviously not scared in the least. It is a sweet tale of a little girl and her little bear. I love how the author uses some big words in a children's book. My son's vocabulary has grown exponentially!",5.0
"I can't begin to count the number of times we have read this book since finally purchasing it for Christmas.  My son loved Corduroy and loves this one just as much.  It's a book that I enjoy as well, so I don't mind reading it over and over.",5.0
This text goes through methodology of changing communities with others. I thought it had some great ideas for initiating a change to take place and ways to get others on board.,5.0
"The book provides an excellent introduction to social entrepreneurship and how individuals can play a role in creating social change.  The authors walk us through what social entrepreneurship is, the pioneers and how it is different from government, activism, and traditional entrepreneurship.  The next section covers the challenges of addressing some of societies most intractable problems through entrepreneurial endeavors. The book concludes with a discussion how to envision an innovating society where people are taking charge of making long term systemic change to society.  A must read for anyone new to the field of social entrepreneurship or wants to help create social change.",5.0
"The most comprehensive overview of social entrepreneurship yet also the shortest and most concise. Each section gives you the needed background about a topic, then summarizes what is happening now with short but insightful comments on every topic. This is, in one short book, the best primer for those who want an overview of the field but also the most penetrating analysis for practitioners. Bornstein's deep knowledge of social entrepreneurship, from the entrepreneurs to the concepts and emerging trends all shine through on every page.",5.0
"We spend most of our days taking in messages about all the problems and wrongs plaguing the world, but Bornstein provides a fresh approach -- highlighting the visionaries who are doing something to fix all those things that need fixing. Whether you're new to world of social entrepreneurship or working in the field, this book will leave you inspired to join the leaders who are showing that it is possible to do work that has lasting impact. This book should be required reading for students of all ages, and for decision-makers around the world.",5.0
"It usually takes me two months to read a nonfiction book. However in this case I read Bornstein and Davis in less than 5 days because I was completely engaged with their explanations and definitions of everything related to social entrepreneurship.
I was fully inspired by Bornstein's ""How to change the world"" and the cases he presented. In his new book with Davis I understood more about social entrepreneurship, its challenges, strengths, etc.
I have been working on an organization that promotes social entrepreneurship for more than 3 years; after reading this book I understand more about my organization and my role.
I believe that this book is crucial for everyone interested in social innovation, public service or social entrepreneurship.",5.0
"David Bornstein is the most important writer in the social entrepreneurship space.  Here he boils down what he has learned from his travel, his research, his thinking to some basics about what is so significant about social entrepreneurship today.  For anyone interested in the topic -- from a practitioner to the interested newbie -- this new volume by David Bornstein and Susan Davis is essential reading.",5.0
"This is one of the best books I've read lately, and I highly recommend it for anyone who considers themselves a Social Entrepreneur or who seeks to work in the field of Social Enterprise. I felt as though the writers knew me personally, and I gleaned much and was encouraged tremendously throughout every page of this book. Well worth the small investment of $11.53. I am putting together teams and a network of women in social enterprise and will have this on the top of the list of books that must be read. Order today and let's get the reviews going!",5.0

I thought it was a great overview of social entrepreneurship and contained some good case studies. Recommend if you are interested in the topic.,5.0
"Much has been written on the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, but this slim volume says more about it than anything else I have read.  It captures the essence of what it is the social entrepreneur does, and puts it in historical context, better than anything out there.  These are two gifted writers melding their varied experiences and perspectives into something that can give grounding and direction to a new generation of social entrepreneurs.  I give this book out to many people who pass through the doors of my office.  I look forward to the follow up volume that tracks what has happened since publication of the original edition.",5.0
"The book itself is inspiring. Its an easy and applicable read in regards to working to change the old social systems that are not working for us anymore.

Read it if you find yourself asking, ""Where are the revolutionaries?!""
Read it if you want to make change for the better of your community.",5.0
"After three decades of increasingly widespread public attention, a surprisingly large number of commentators in the field of social entrepreneurship continue to argue about the most basic question of all: What is a social enterprise, and what isn't? In this superb little book, David Bornstein and Susan Davis straightforwardly put this question to rest: ""Social entrepreneurship is a process by which citizens build or transform institutions to advance solutions to social problems, such as poverty, illness, illiteracy, environmental destruction, human rights abuses, and corruption, in order to make life better for many."" So much for all those deconstructionists who contend that a social enterprise must never turn a profit, or must always turn a profit, or must address some sorts of problems but not others!

As an introduction to the field, Social Entrepreneurship is unmatched.

Most books on social entrepreneurship feature case studies or vignettes starring some of the field's most innovative and successful individuals. This was the case with an earlier book of Bornstein's, How to Change the World, which is widely (and rightfully) regarded as ""the bible"" of the field. By contrast, the three short chapters that constitute Social Entrepreneurship ask and answer the most fundamental questions that any reader unfamiliar with the pursuit of social change might ask, first clarifying the definition of social entrepreneurship, then examining the practical challenges practitioners face, and finally ""Envisioning an Innovating Society."" In that third chapter, Bornstein and Davis discuss how government, academia, business, philanthropy, and the news media might contribute to fashioning the ""everyone a changemaker"" world posited by Ashoka's Bill Drayton.

As the authors point out, ""Social entrepreneurs have always existed. But in the past they were called visionaries, humanitarians, philanthropists, reformers, saints, or simply great leaders. Attention was paid to their courage, compassion, and vision but rarely to the practical aspects of their accomplishments. Thus, people may know about the moral teachings of St. Francis but not about how the Franciscans became the fastest growing religious order of its day. Children learn that Florence Nightingale ministered to wounded soldiers but not that she built the first professional school for nurses and revolutionized hospital construction. Gandhi is remembered for demonstrations of nonviolent rsistance but not for building a decentralized political apparatus that enabled India to make a successful transition to self-rule."" And if St. Francis, Florence Nightingale, and Gandhi exemplified the isolated and occasional social entrepreneurs of yesteryear, there are thousands of courageous individuals now walking parallel paths to institutional change on every continent -- backed up by a growing suport network that includes Ashoka, the Skoll Foundation, the Schwab Center for Social Entrepreneurship, Avina, and many other organizations. Given the enormity of the challenges facing humanity in the 21st Century, their combined efforts may represent our last, best hope to create a world in which our grandchildren can live healthy, rewarding lives.

David Bornstein and Susan Davis came to the task of writing this book with impeccable qualifications. In addition to How to Change the World, which went into a second edition in 2007, Bornstein wrote The Price of a Dream: The Story of the Grameen Bank, first published in 1996. He is the preeminent journalist in the field. Davis is a supremely accomplished activist, having served as a founding member of the Grameen Foundation and then co-founding BRAC USA, which she serves as President and CEO. (BRAC began its institutional life as a Bangladeshi nonprofit, later expanding to many other countries around the world. It is regarded as the world's largest NGO.) She also helps select Ashoka Fellows. Previously, she held a series of senior positions with the Ford Foundation, Women's World Banking, the International Labor Organisation, and other institutions.

"This book is a great place to start for anyone who wants to participate in changing the world. I know,the idea of one person changing the world may sound crazy to many, but this book isn't for ""the many"";it's for those who have the audacity to believe that the world is full of potential to be ""better"" and they could be a catalyst for that better. The book is a toolbox filled with tangible information on where to start,who to see and what to do to change things at any level you can imagine from just within you to your family or even the world.",5.0
"A group of Georgia Tech students I was a part of this year researching social entrepreneurship and design added this title to our reading list at the recommendation of one of the college of management's senior faculty and we were extremely pleased with it. Of the 20+ books and dozens of articles, white papers and essays we read on the subject, this modestly sized book held a wealth of information, resources, cases and essential guidance on current pursuits attempting to create better commerce and better societies through synthesized, creative efforts. The most compelling businesses and philanthropic organizations are not adhering to ""traditional"" modes of operation, financing, client relations or philosophies and this book tell the story of how many are doing it. A great starting point and comprehensive over view, this should be the basis for anyone interested in learning more.",5.0
"George Soros once said, ""Let business be business and philanthropy be philanthropy. Keep the two separate."" And never the twain shall meet. However, even Soros, capitalist businessman and philanthropist extraordinaire, eventually succumbed to seeing the merits of and need for social enterprise. David Bornstein and Susan Davis, two scholars of social innovation, offer a truly inspiring book about the noble, burgeoning field of ""social entrepreneurship."" They offer recognition to the countless anonymous individuals who address the world's most intractable problems, and they dole out useful advice to the ""changemakers"" who give voices to people who have none. Although this guide may be a tad basic for workers at established social enterprises, getAbstract recommends it as a wonderful source of tips and inspiration to budding social entrepreneurs in all fields who strive to change the world for the better.",5.0

What's cool is the inner pen loop can be used for m Bible highlighter, and there's a space for a notebook, plus 4 other pockets so Ican skip the purse if I want to when I head to church.  Gonna grab some fabric paint and decorate it to personalize it.  Since the cover is fabric instead of leather, you can use needle and thread, too, if you have the know-how.  If you have a super giant print Sword, sheath it with this bad bo, and you are golden.  Be blessed!",5.0

"The Adventure Bible Cover is perfect for my 3 and 5 year old to be able to carry their Adventure Bible to church. They see mommy and daddy carry their Bibles to church and they want to also. It was a bit problematic since their Bibles are a bit heavy and a tad too big for their small hands. Now they can simply hold the cover's handle and walk nicely with their own Bible. It protects the Bible from baby sister's curious hands as well. The fabric and zipper are very sturdy, the cover overall appears to be of great quality. There is ample room in the pockets for pens, pencils, some crayons, a notepad, etc. We highly recommend this product!",5.0

"An accurate, detailed description and video are given in another review so I won't go over that info again.

I LOVE this cover.  I did not buy it as a bible cover, but as a journal cover for my beloved Leuchtturm 1917 Dotted Berry Notebook (5.75 by 8.25 inches, 249 pages).  I used a seam ripper and removed the ""Adventure Bible"" logo from the front of the cover.  It came off easily, but did leave small holes from the stitching (see photo).  It is not too noticeable, though I do plan on putting a patch or something on to cover them. I'm picky :) The fabric the cover is made out of is a bit stiff.  This causes the case to get a bit ""crunched"" looking on the outside unless it is stuffed full.  It isn't a big negative, but I have included a picture to show this.

Even if you aren't traveling, this cover is a great way to keep all your favorite journaling goodies together right where you need them.

The pockets on the outside give you plenty of room for lots of pens/ markers, post-its, big glue stick, scissors, washi tape, ruler, etc. (I have all of those things and more in mine!)  The outside pockets have a little gap on the sides where the flap doesn't quite cover the depth of the pockets (see photo).  I haven't had anything fall out yet, so it seems like it'll be ok.  If you are worried you could add a bit of velcro there.

On the inside there are two pen loops, and two slim pockets intended to hold the covers of the bible.  I keep my journal inside one of the pockets, and varying items in the other.  The pockets don't hold anything tightly, but it makes your journal not go flying out when you open it.  The inside is quite large, and would hold two of the Leuchtturm journals and still leave room for more.

For the price and features, you can't find a better journal cover.

Note - The flash caused the journal too look very shiny in my photos.  It's not.  The color (minus shine) is represented faithfully.

UPDATE:  It has been almost 6 months since I bought this and it is holding up extremely well.  Very durable.  It holds a ton of stuff, and has been perfect for the purpose of a travel cover for my art journal.",5.0

"Bought this for my 3 year old after purchasing one in a store for my 5 year old and not being able to find another one in the store. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I was hoping to find them matching ones.
This is the perfect size for a larger Bible in which they will have as they grow. There are lots of storage pockets, for small notepads, tithing money and their various lip gloss and such! There are even 2 pen holders on the inside in which they use one for a highlighter. I love that this zips all the way around so they don't lose things out of it and there is a carry handle which is a must! The design is highly functional and I feel it is something they can use for years to come! I even got the backside monogrammed with their names and the product worked perfect for this!",5.0

This one is NOT well made!",5.0

"This book cover fits numerous bibles. My son prefers a NIV student bible which is much larger than his previous adventure bible. Though it is a tight fit, it is able to be zipped in this cover. I like the zipping cover quality and he is able to store a small notebook and a pen in the front pockets. The all-in-one feel this cover has is great for students in bible study groups - my son enjoys being able to just grab the case and knowing 1) nothing will fall out and 2) everything he needs is still there.",5.0

"The Adventure Bible Cover is perfect for my 3 and 5 year old to be able to carry their Adventure Bible to church. They see mommy and daddy carry their Bibles to church and they want to also. It was a bit problematic since their Bibles are a bit heavy and a tad too big for their small hands. Now they can simply hold the cover's handle and walk nicely with their own Bible. It protects the Bible from baby sister's curious hands as well. The fabric and zipper are very sturdy, the cover overall appears to be of great quality. There is ample room in the pockets for pens, pencils, some crayons, a notepad, etc. We highly recommend this product!",5.0

"I got this cover for my grandson, who is using it for The Beginners Bible, not the Adventure Bible.  However, it is a medium size, so it works.  He likes the pockets and the rugged look, which works nicely for a boy.  When he is older I can use the same cover for the Adventure Bible.",5.0

"This was the second one of these exact bible covers i purchased because i love it so much.  Lots of storage, not too kiddy and not too mature, it's perfect to grow with my 7yr old son!  I ordered one for school and one for home.  I love it.",5.0
"These Bible Book Covers make great covers for Boy Scout Handbooks.

The Medium in particular has several extra pockets on the front for scouting doodads.

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

"Perfect-- we did not have the workmanship issues that others have reported; perhaps one bad batch went out, and that is resolved now? It keeps up with busy and active boys, and is easily washable.",5.0

"Works great for my sons boyscout book, fits great.",5.0
"We purchased this case for my son's Webelo scout book. It's perfect and I'm glad we opted for this case rather than the case offered in that scout store. Pro's: it's army green, has extra pockets on the outside, a carabiner with a compass (that doesn't work properly but looks cool to the user, so I'm happy, and a nice handle.

On the inside, the case is just as nice. It has pockets to hold the cover of the book, of course, but also pencil loops which I am particularly happy about.

Great case.",5.0
"Medium size is slightly too roomy for the Boy Scout handbook, but it works and we love the pockets for keeping advancement paperwork, permission slips, pens and more.",5.0
Fits my sons boy scout book!,5.0
"I am always on the lookout for cool products that also have a practical usage.  My son goes on a lot of Boy Scout campouts.  The boys are always bringing their scout handbooks so they can record and get signed off their new accomplishments.  However all the boys are hard on their handbooks and the notebooks they carry too.  I saw the Zondervan book cover and thought it would be good for a smaller notebook and his Boy Scout handbook, along with some pens/pencils/etc..  I ordered the Zondervan book cover and thanks to Amazon Prime, it only took two days for it to arrive.

The Zondervan book cover is very well made.  It holds the scout handbook in either the front pocket or the inside pocket.  It looks very ""scout-like"" with the greenish color.  The compass is cheap but it actually works! Nice addition!

Overall I feel the Zondervan book cover is a great value.

"I got this one because of all the other reviews that said it was a good size for the Boy Scout manual. I agree. It's so much nicer than the one in the Scout Ship, since this one has pockets on the outside and even comes with a little compass. The outer meet pocket is good for pencils or random papers, and the inside is plenty large enough to hold either the spiral bound handbook or the regular spined version. It has an outer handle that also makes it easier for him to carry, and it's a good forest green color which it's about the same shade as his uniform pants.",5.0
"perfect, durable, what more could you want.  It holds a lot more than the book too:  small notebook, merit badge papers, blue cards, etc.  Not big enough for the proper merit badge booklets, but print outs.",5.0

"Purchased this or my sons Boy Scout book. Awesome book cover with plenty of pockets and room for pens, pencils, his compass, and small notepad! The only drawback is the cover does not have any kind of retention system for a book to stay in the cover. Seeing how the boy scout book was the spiral bound, I punched 2 holes in the top and bottom of the spine of the cover and ran some 550 cord through the cover and the spiral of the book. Stays in place now. That would be the ONLY thing I would change on this, some sort of book retention inside the cover.",5.0
"Perfect for both my Cub Scout and Boy Scout!  They like that they can store a pencil or any extra papers, patches, cards, etc..",5.0

"GREAT Bible cover for my pre-teen boy.  This has been thrown around, sat on, slid across the youth room, spilled on, buried under heaps of (___?), and who knows what else.  And has come through it all shockingly well!  It's a pretty tough canvas material, and can be wiped clean when needed.  The full size pocket on the front is perfect for a study guide, book, or journal, and the pen pocket ensures that he has a pencil handy.  Don't even ask what he keeps in the 2 small pockets.  (Trinkets, treasures, whatever.)  The handle makes it wonderfully convenient to swing it around at his brother's head -- in self-defense, of course, -- but the handle is still firmly attached and shows no sign of coming loose.  All in all, a sound investment to protect what he will hopefully one day come to cherish.  Until then, I'll settle for keeping it intact.",5.0
"Works perfectly for my son's Boy Scout handbook, with plenty of room for a few extras.",5.0
"It's a pretty nice bible cover.  My grandson loves it.  It's canvas, has a few extra pockets and a little compass.",5.0
My son uses this case for his Boy Scouts Handbook and it works great.,5.0
Bought for my son's Webblo Cub scout Handbook. He has the spiral one. Im a single mom on a small budget and was iffy on spending the money on this but I'm glad I did !

"I got this for my son's Boyscout book, fits perfect and protects it during camp outs. He liked the compass and extra pockets for anything else he might need like his whittling chip, small notebook, and pen.",5.0
Kids loved it.,5.0
"I purchased for my son who is in Boy Scouts.  He really likes this cover quite a bit - better than what you can find at the Scout Shop for sure.  He has a nice Tritium compass already so relocated the compass that came with this to his first aid / survival kit.  He also got his name embroidered on the top flap.

Parent perspective: Construction quality is good.  There could have been a little more care taken in the cut of the fabric as the ""grains"" don't line up nicely with the edges, but it's a minor nit.  Overall the item is doing the expected / intended job quite well and I can honestly say I would recommend to other parents of Scouts.",5.0
Great for Boy Scout Handbook.,5.0
Very durable book cover we ended up using for our Boy Scout books. The boys love the unique look,5.0
Excellent for keeping the Scout Handbook in,5.0
Exactly what I needed for my son's Boy Scouts handbook...providing plenty of compartments for additional supplies,5.0
My kiddo love his bible case! Good quality.,5.0
"I bought this for my new-to-Boy Scouting 13yo son.  It fits his spiral-bound handbook perfectly with TONS of room for more booklets, etc.  The compass is GREAT quality!  My husband was so thrilled with the quality and purchase.  At the last meeting, the Scout Master's wife was checking out the book cover...she was very intrigued. :)",5.0
Perfect fit for my son's boy scout handbook.,5.0
"Got this for my son to keep his BSA handbook in, as other reviews had said it was good size for it. Love the case. Love the extra pockets and pouches for notebook, pens and a few little extras. Handle makes for convenient carry. The compass I thought would feel plasticky and cheap, but was pleasantly suprised that it seemed fairly sturdy!  The size is a pretty loose fit for his handbook, so if the book slide, the covers can slip out of the pockets. I don't know if the smaller cover would fit the book,but in either case, this is not a fault of the cover itself, as it never claimed to be made to fit my specific book.",5.0
"As a newly minted Boy Scout, my son was ecstatic to receive the Compass Med protector for his Boy Scout Handbook. Given that the Handbook must be taken to every meeting, event, and camp-out, the Compass Med will help buffer the wear-and-tear.

Positives
- Thick sturdy zipper that won't tear out
- Multiple front pockets that fit writing utensils, badge cards, money, etc.
- Camo coloring that matches the Boy Scout color themes

Negatives
- Slightly too big for a Boy Scout Handbook (not really a negative since it is intended for the ""Bible"")

My son loves the product so much that it will be the birthday present of choice for all Boy Scout friends.",5.0
Bought this for my son's boy scout book after seeing another with it. Small pockets for miscellaneous  items and it even comes worth a compass,5.0
"Perfect fit for my boys Scout book (spiral bound). It has two half size pockets on each side and a pen or pencil holder on both sides. Try full height outside pocket with Velcro flap is handy. The two buttoned pockets are of ""what not"" size. Overall good product. Now to see if will stand up to time.....",5.0
"This is a quality made Bible case, I had bought a cheaper camo one and the zipper broke within a week.  This case is very durable and the zipper is thick and tough.  The extra pockets and compass are very handy bonus. This fits my son's NKJV Bible perfectly.",5.0
"We are able to fit a regular sized Boy Scout handbook (not spiral bound), plus a leather journal for him to write anything else he needs for the merit badges he's working on. There is still room to put any other papers in there that he might need without there being too much room. It's not too big at all.",5.0

Great for a boyscout handbook cover as well.,5.0
"Purchased Nov 2015 - My 12 year old son is in the boy scouts and when this product arrived, I gave it to him to open the package. He was thrilled when he saw it. This cool book cover comes with a compass carabiner, holds his official boy scout handbook, pen, money, compass, knife, and it also has mini pockets for plenty of other tiny trinkets he likes to carry. My son still carries this with him to the weekly scout meetings and it's been on camping trips and held up just fine for over a year now. It has been a really good and useful product I definitely recommend it for anyone in the scouting world. Was this review helpful?",5.0
"7 year old loves this cover, it's sturdy and fits his adventure bible NIrV great",5.0
"I purchased this for my son's Boy Scout book with spiral binding and it fits inside just right. There is also a bit of extra room to put a small notebook/planner/phonebook type booklet inside with it. It zips shut and then on the front there are a bunch of various sized pockets to store various items. My son can keep pens, a small bottle of hand sanitize, his pocket knife, some band aides and a few other things in these pockets so that he is prepared at troop meetings. The color also blends well with his uniform and he has gotten a lot of compliments from other boys and parents. The mom bonus for me is that his book isn't all dirty and falling apart like some of the other boys books! I found out quickly that the boys bring them but often toss them around, or if they see them laying around they have no problem stepping on them while running around playing. Even the older boys that should known better. For some reason they do this will plain books but not with bags or covered books so this helps to protect the book from him and the other boys!",5.0
"As others have stated, we use it for a Scout handbook cover. It is working great and allows room for him to carry stuff around.",5.0
Excellent product except for the compass which didn't seem to know which direction to go. Should leave it off.,5.0
Perfect for Webelos Scout Book.  Was able to embroider name on large flap on front.,5.0

Son loves this cover to go with his new Bible. Loves the pockets and fits his new Bible perfectly.,5.0
"Great scout book cover.  I get a lot of compliments and questions about this because it is much better than the standard Scout Book covers.  It's great quality and the compartments make it easy to carry more stuff (pens, notpad, flash drive, etc.)",5.0
"Works to hold the BSA handbook, a pen and other necessities, and is very durable.

Also the envy of the other Boy Scouts in the troop.  Was tortured into revealing the source.  There goes my kids exclusivity.",5.0

Very nice quality.  We needed this for a Boy Scout handbook and we like it more so than the official Scout cover.  Room for some pens and paper and some neat little pockets as well.  It has held up nicely through some very wet and dirty Scout outings.,5.0
"I can say, writing this over a year later, that this bible cover is holding up to my 10 year old boy heavy use.  It travels with him twice a week and he easily tears up anything he carries.

"perfect for a boy scout hand book, zipps up a the way around to keep it from getting bumped up.",5.0
"I'm using this for a cover for a Boy Scout handbook for my son and I love it.  It protects the book completely, he's gotten a ton of compliments on it, and it conveniently holds a pen, and the merit badges I haven't had a chance to sew on yet.  Plus the compass actually works - bonus.  He also loves the carry handle.  All in all, this is a way better choice than the ""official"" cover they sell in the Scout store, which does not zip closed and therefore leaves the pages / sides of the book open to the elements.  The Medium size cover fits the Scout book well.",5.0
"This is just a tiny bit big for my son's BSA scout handbook with spiral bidning but it works great. HE is able to organize all this paperwork and blue cards, and carry pens in the front pouch. The compass part is silly, but who cares. I really like this cover.",5.0
"My son is a first year Boy Scout. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and bought the Size Small book cover, rather than the Medium. It is slightly too large, but I am sure in time it will be filled with Boy Scout papers. The book cover itself is awesome.",5.0
"This zippered cover is GREAT!  SOOO Much better than what is available at the Boy Scout store.  My son is HARD on things in general, and the zipper on the accessory pouch came off the manual we bought at the Scout store within a couple of months.  We bought the nicer of the two covers they had too.  The velcro closure was hard to keep closed after a year or so.

This cover is very durable, has a better zipper, is a perfect fit, and has more pockets for extra stuff (blue cards, pens, compass, etc.  Would HIGHLY recommend for any Boy Scout to protect his manual.  Buying on Amazon was also easy as usual.

Suggestion to Scouts & parents of Scouts:
Buy this cover FIRST for your Scout manual and don't waste your money on what they sell at the Boy Scout store.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"My son is using this for his Boy Scout handbook at it absolutely wonderful.  Holds handbook, roster, notepad, pen, pencil, a small first aid kit and even his camera. It was so well received that some other boys in his patrol got it as well.",5.0
Bought this to be used as a cover/holder for my son's BSA handbook.  I ordered the medium size and it was the perfect fit it.  The only very minor issue was the compass that came with the cover is a little hard to use.  The floating disk doesn't float as freely as I would expect nice compasses to move.  Need to jiggle it for a while to allow it to really settle at the correct reading.  Didn't buy the product for the compass so still 5 stars from me.,5.0
Great for son's scout book.  Lots of pockets for all of the stuff he seems to need to carry around all of the time.,5.0
"Bought this for my son's boy scout handbook.
Nice rugged cover with durable zipper.

Plenty of room for the handbook, pencil, pen, merit badge books, etc.
Much nicer cover than the one sold at the Boy Scout Store.

Feb 2017 update
This is an extremely durable book cover and has held up very well over the past 3 years.  My son received it at age 11, and has used the book cover for troop meetings, campouts out and summer camp.  No tears, the zipper works great, and the velcro and snaps are intact.",5.0
I bought this for my son's Boy Scout handbook and it fit perfectly (bounded not ringed). He is able to also keep a small notebook and pen inside. The two pockets on the front are perfect for storing badges until we get them sewed on. Works very well!,5.0
"I purchased this for my son's Boy Scout manual. It fits fine and has several extra pockets for other accessories. I had sprayed my son's book cover with some ""Never Wet"" moisture repellent and it is now pretty much water proof. Several other Boy Scouts asked where to get it and bought some for themselves. It's a wonderful little cover/organizer.",5.0
bought this as a Arrow of Light crossover gift for my Cub Scout going to Boy Scouts. Fits his book perfect with room for a small notebook and loose papers also. He loves that he can throw all his blue cards and things in it zip it shut and toss it in his tent and nothing gets lost. Great Scout gift. Hope it last him though Eagle!,5.0
I bought this for 11 year old to keep safe his boy scout spiral handbook. It fits perfectly and has exact room to keep pen etc,5.0
"Bought this for my son who is a Boy Scout, he has used this to carry his Boy Scout book, a small notebook and pens.  It has been on many camping trips and is still in great shape.  It is also stylish enough that kids will WANT to use it.  The ""compass"" is a novelty and all but useless--but no points off for that!",5.0
I do not Know how it is or was look at the order and it will tell you it went write to the recipient. not my home. Ask her as we are no longer specking as to the things  she pulled on facebook  right after I ordered this book for her  child for her and had it sent directly to her home thank goodness she paid for it. thank you and I am very sorry I was not able to provide much more info.,1.0
"Did not anyone see something disturbing about a little friend that gets locked in the laundromat at night, and there appears a strange man who plays with the bear, then removes his clothing washes them and then redresses the little bear friend. Well, given today's social climate regarding this type of exposure to strangers, perhaps we should reconsider this outdated story line as inappropriate for our little innocent ones.",1.0
"I hate this book. I LOVE the original Courduroy but this sequel irritates the living daylights out of me. As far as I can tell the world which Courduroy inhabits is supposed to be *somewhat* realistic - and in the original book, it is. But in this one, the caricature of the artist (in a beret? REALLY?!) is just painfully clunky, as is the name of the Hispanic-owned laundromat (""Pandro's"").  *sigh*  Since I have read it approximately a billion times, little things become impossible to ignore, like the fact that Lisa's mom tells her the laundromat is ""about to close"" but the artist has time to run an entire dryer cycle before the manager says the place is closing. And if Courduroy is too precious to get lost, shouldn't it be LISA'S name on the little card in his pocket?  It's all very sloppy and undermines any residual charm left over from the first book.  I am SO disappointed and this book might ""accidentally"" fall into the fireplcace aaaaaany day now.",1.0
"My wife and I as well as our daughter loved the original Corduroy book. We began reading this book to our daughter when she was three and a half and didn't notice anything wrong with it. Very soon after introducing the book, our daughter began having terrible anxiety about being dropped off at a children's group that she'd always loved before. Suddenly it occurred to me that it was probably the book. Lisa takes Corduroy with her to a laundromat and Corduroy wanders away into a stranger's laundry bag. Lisa and her mother have to leave without Corduroy, and the stranger throws Corduroy into a dryer. He doesn't start the machine but pulls Corduroy out and undresses him to dry the bear's overalls. Corduroy waits with this stranger, undressed, while his overalls dry. Then the stranger puts Corduroy's clothes back on and puts him up on a shelf. The attendant turns out all the lights and Corduroy is left all alone in the dark, abandoned by his loved ones, locked in a strange place. He gets into some mischief and seems to enjoy himself, but as another reviewer mentioned, the drawings reflect the darkness of a closed laundromat and it looks pretty scary. Can't believe we didn't realize the effect the book could have on a three year old until it was too late. We've been dealing with this issue for a couple of months now and it's breaking our hearts.",1.0
"Purchased this because I had bought a Zondervan LG cover and was very pleased with the construction. The LG cover was heavy canvas and lined with a nice nylon inside ( see pictures on a review of a similar item in XL size Black). This is rough cheaper canvas, front pocket does not zipper as picture shows, very flimsy construction. Have also ordered another cover and when rec'd will probably return this XXL one.",1.0
The handle is tearing away from the nylon fabric after only a few uses.  The handle should be reinforced so that children using them doesn't end in a whole or torn handle.,1.0
My daughter and I were very wxcited about this purchase but when it arrived it was too small. We looked at the dimensions online and thought it would be the correct width. When it arrived it was much too small for her bible. Super disappointed. Otherwise it was perfect! Great if you have a smaller bible.,1.0
It's a little to big for the very Bible it was intended for.  The Bible will not stay in place and falls out.,1.0

"The bible cover has a nice pouch in front, but lacks a bookmark that comes with every other bible cover.  This was tolerable.  However, within 3 Sundays of using the cover, the strap tore right off.  This is completely unacceptable.  I do not recommend anyone purchasing this cover.",1.0
I ordered this Bible cover to replace one of the same manufacture that my some had used for over three years. This one however only lasted a week before the thin vinyl where the hand strap is located ripped from the inside because the heavier plastic handle backing cut right through. I will not purchase another that is not made of heavier fabric material,1.0
I really like the organizer.  I had a hard time finding one with a over the shoulder strap.  It has places to store different things.,1.0
Wasn't what I expected from description and I returned it with dissatisfaction.,1.0
We ordered it not realizing that something like a Bible cover would come in different sizes. It was an XL and waaay to big for my grandsons Bible. We reordered a mEdium but they are out of stock. We have returned the XL and are waiting to see if more come in in the mEdium size. So as of now my grandson has no Christmas gift from me. ,1.0

"Misleading information.  This is not extra large as advertised.

"I still love the way the cover looks, but after about 7 months of use (weekly carrying to church on Sunday/Wednesday) the handle broke.  Where it is sewn on it came apart - it was as if the thread when stitched had cut the material and it just ""cut"" through it over time.  I was very disappointed and was hoping for him to get more use than this out of it.
The rest of the case was in perfect condition, with little to no wear on it.  This was definitely something that was faulty in the manufacturing of the case.

---OLD REVIEW---
Purchased for my husband at Christmas and he absolutely loved it. The picture doesn't do it justice. It's very rugged looking, and it feels like a nicely worn leather. It's not flimsy at all, and perfect for his bible. Has a deep pocket on the outside, and pen holders on the inside. I am very pleased with the purchase I made, and the price was very reasonable.",1.0

Leather does not stretch and then pop off and it smelled just like plastic. A Bible cover. Please tell if this is genuine leather or plastic. You give no more information on it being made of leather in your extended description, I thought that very odd, not even it was made of man made materials (plastic) nothing. Like omission could be your defense ,keep them thinking it's made of leather. I hope I veiw it later with a more descipt description and others remember the old standing rule about advertising when they post their wares. God be with you.",1.0
"Even though the description stated it would fit, this is too small for my wife's Zondervan Bible and it is not made of leather. Amazon Customer Service gets 5 Stars.

I did not find any leather in this Bible Cover.  I do like the purse style and believe it is easier on the spine of large study Bibles.

Reptile leather is really cheap-looking plastic. I could tell that the bits of plastic that held the handles was not going to last. Returned for refund.,1.0

text book for someone else- few years ago,1.0
where to start well I guess it would be the quoted very good condition which was a lie. the package arrived without being sealed and having little to no tape on it. the back cover of the book is near falling off and the front cover is not far behind. it is missing many pages including the first 18 pages and the pages that it did have are either written on or bent. if I didn't need it for the rest of my course I would send it back but I cant.,1.0
"I ordered the book. I knew it was a used book but I had no idea pages were missing. Not only am out the money I paid for this book. I had to buy another book.
Have a good day.",1.0
Did not hold the children's attention.  Too busy of a book.  Did not care for it at all.,1.0
"I borrowed this one from the library because I'm teaching my 2 year old the alphabet. It's nice that it features lowercase letters, but it isn't educational at all. It is a simple story with letters as characters. Little i loses its dot and the other letters help. Nothing about the sounds the letters make except one page where each letter finds an object to replace the dot and they each pick something that starts with their letter. But there is nothing in the text about that, it is only shown in the picture. The object that Little i likes best is the cherry, which doesn't even make the sound that a new letter learner knows for c. The story is not great, it is not educational at all, and for me, the computer graphics are not appealing. I would never use this book in my classroom, and won't be reading it to my daughter again.",1.0
I can't believe this product is priced at over 170.00 who would pay that much it is more like ten dollars.,1.0
this is not what the description says about it. you need to laminate them youself and figure out a way to attach the piecesfeel like this is not a finished producti would return it but it my son already tear it. not recommened but unless they lower the price,1.0
"Incomplete, no way to attach numbers, days, ect to the house. It requires a bulletin board to use. We were unaware of this and couldn't be more disappointed.",1.0
"If you're looking for something high quality don't get this. It's a piece of paper. It wasn't well wrapped in the packing and was just shoved in the box. The box was wet upon arrival and the paper was mostly ruined. I'm unable to use it in my classroom. Wish I had gone with something better quality. It looks better in the picture than it does in person, especially when wet and wrinkled and doesn't come with the necessary items to attach the arrow (that I have to cut out on my own). For what I paid for it I definitely expected more. My kids like it and like the look of it. It's just not sturdy enough for a classroom. I'm going to have to attach cardboard to the back and hope I can iron it flat now that it's dry. Not sure how long it will last. Also have to go shopping to get something to somehow attach the arrow so that it will turn when the kids change the weather each day. Ugggh. NOT my best buy. Don't recommend it.

The tracing pages are fine, but when you get to the pages where the child is supposed to cut through the paper, the publisher printed lessons on both sides of the page.  For example, one page instructs the child to cut along jagged lines and the flip side of the page instructs the child to color in squares and then cut them out.  How can they do both?  You have to choose one page or the other.  This is the case on pages 26-48.  Dumb, Dumb, Dumb.
They should say in the description that you need to photo copy the whole second half of the book so the cutting lessons can be performed.",1.0
1 star for calendar being cut in half.  It's in two pieces.  You'll have to tape it together and have it laminated so it can stay as one whole piece on the wall.

"Great price for a truly beatiful map--but buy it at a brick and morter store, especially if you want to mount it for display. Ordered my first one from Amazon and found a crushed triangular cardboard box on my doorstep. The rolled map sustaind heavy creases. Shame on UPS I figured. My bad luck. And I wasn't interested in spending time and hassle to request a replacement and ship it back considering it is a ten dollar item.

The map is packaged very poorly by the manufacturer in my opinion. A loose roll of this pretty but lightweight parchment-looking paper in a flimsy plastic container. Would protect fine hanging from a display peg in a shop. But, the real issue is the way Amazon packages it in a three-sided flimsy cardboard box. Any weight from other heavy packages during transit can and will wreck the map even if the crushed cardboard isn't torn.

So several months go buy and I add another one to an order qualifying for free shipping. Only gambling 10 bucks--surely lightening won't strike twice.  Wrong! I open my door in time to see the truck drive off and a torn, mangled box sits on my porch with another creased map inside.

I appreciate the quick turnaround on the original order and the replacements, but it is absolutely ridiculous that a rolled-up laminated map would be packed for shipping without a protective tube (or without even a box, in two cases).

"I was totally dissapointed with this map.  I ordered this to put it up in my daughter's room. But when I receive this, it was all wringkled and the laminating was so thin to tell whether it is acutally laminated at all.  I am keeping them just because my daughter wants it in her room so bad yet I don't recommand this to anyone.....",1.0
"I'm sure that it's a great calendar. However, upon arrival, the packaging clearly stated ""FLAME RETARDANT.""

Really?? Flame retardant on a children's calendar?? What are you thinking, Scholastic? Flame retardants are extremely hazardous to everyone's health, and especially to young children! Did you know that young children typically have as much as four times as many flame retardant chemicals in their blood than do their parents? And that these retardants have been linked to all kinds of health issues?

I have been careful to avoid having flame retardants in my home, in my children's pajamas, and so on. Therefore, I didn't even bother to open the package. I just don't want my children using and handling something that has flame retardants on it.

I am extremely disappointed that a calendar which is being used by young children would have flame retardants on it.

On another note, I weighed out the options of the various calendar pocket charts on Amazon before settling on this one. After doing another search after purchasing it, I discovered this same calendar on several other sites for significantly less. If you still want this one even with the flame retardants, at least shop around first.",1.0
Made with very flimsy material.  I returned it.  It should be made with the same material has the 27 pocket organizer.,1.0
Very poor quality. The material is not durable. I also don't like the fact that you can't label each slot.,1.0
"Product was ""flimsier"" than it appeared and when I went to return it, I was charged an inordinate amount.  The return rip-off was what made my experience the unsatisfactory event that it was.  I do not blame the company for any misrepresentation of the quality; it just did not suit my needs.  The cost of returning the item, however, was another story!",1.0
ONLY because my business is PANDA themed I went the extra mile and did not return this item. These pieces are NOT laminated and are on thinish paper so if you want to use this really for anything you have to take it to Staples or somewhere like that and have them put them on large sheets of lamination which cost me $30 + and then you have to cut the pieces out and then carefully locate how and where you want pieces to stick and then add on your own Velcro which is more cost.,1.0
"I ordered this chart and two others similar to it to put in my daughter's playroom.  The description says ""plastic coated"".  This, apparently, is not the same as laminated. The chart has about as much plastic coating as a playing card.  It is flimsy, easily ripped, and the person who packed the poster rolled it tightly and mashed it to where there are permanent creases all over it and it won't lay flat for wall-mounting. I am not happy, but I also don't want to go through the hoop-jumping process of sending the darn stuff back.  Teachers and moms- BEWARE.",1.0
They really should have changed the product description to chart only NO cards. They only give you the chart to display the schedule. You have to purchase the cards that go i the slots separately. They really should  be up front about this in the description.,1.0

"Absolute garbage arrived. My poster has a massive crease on it from one corner diagonal to the next. Why would you ship something like this? What arrived was absolutely hot garbage! Disgusting seller!

I know it's only a few bucks but it's for my kid's room and I wanted it to look nice. Now it is just an expensive fire starter...

Save yourself the trouble, pass on this garbage.",1.0
DON'T BUY!!!!!I received an ripped poster. The poster had an 2 1/2 inch rip at the top and the bottom had an 3inch rip. So angry!! I wish I could give an 1/2 star,1.0

"This was a very nice poster.  I wish I would have kept it, as it would have been a great asset to my daycare/preschool.  The truth is the poster arrived torn in half! It couldn't have happened during shipping either because the poster was placed in the box in two pieces and the shipping tape was in tact when it arrived! I can't comprehend how a company would ship a torn in half poster to their customer??? This wasn't in the product description.  If the product arrived in better condition I would give it 5 stars.  But since it arrived torn I hated it.  I also asked the seller for a exchange, not a refund- but apparently they didn't care because they just refunded my money.  Too bad I will have to buy a different product from a merchant that sells their products in tact.",1.0

This is no exaggeration you need to get a magnifying glass to read that. You would do best to just buy this product from a Teacher's Store because its the same price online you'd pay a killing in shipping. The price alone for the Pocket Chart I priced was $34.99.

"Very disappointed to discover that I had to cut these out myself.  Not only was this time-consuming, but even with a nice rotary paper-cutter, it is difficult to get a perfectly even final product that does not show the 'dividing lines' of the cards.

Not at all the high-quality product I was expecting from Scholastic or Education Station.",1.0
"I was very disappointed to open the package and find that the pocket chart is not included in this item.  I would never pay $12.00 for cardboard numbers!

I wish I would have read the reviews more closely.",1.0

"I have a copy of this book. On the back cover it is listed at $4.99. I wrote to amazon, but did not receive a response. So I figured that Scholastic raised the price of the planner. It is listed on Amazon that the MSRP is $6.99, and they have discounted it to $5.14. So I ordered it, and on the back it is still marked at MSRP $4.99, and I was charged the discounted rate of $5.14.

In addition, all of the heroes of this self-help book/planner are CEOs, so it's bro-y capitalism the authors of this ""journal"" are touting.

I used it for ONE class before it stopped working, it would refuse to turn on/off when needed. I had to send it back still on bc it would NOT shut off but when I needed it on in class it would not turn on. Don't be cheap on this one spend the extra little bit to get yourself the clicker two so you can see the answer you sent on the screen, see that it sent, etc. You don't want to have to sit in class and wonder if your clicker is even working when your prof uses them as a participation grade!

"Beware if u need a clicker for school. My school required HITT clickers, not iclickers. The customer service for iclicker is HORRID. You better believe they will NOT give you your money back or properly take care of any issues. In my case, I never asked for my money back, I only asked to deregister my personal information off of the remote when I registered it online. Less than 24 hours when I registered I called about this issue. The woman assisting me was of NO help. She couldn't understand what I was saying after 5 minutes of me explaining what I wanted her to do. Instead she kept prodding for my personal information to register for a device!
I asked to speak to someone else for better customer service and assistance. Her response: No, you can speak with me.
I honestly do not have the patience to rant about my unsatisfactory assistance. I'd also like to mention that I sent them an email which was responded to about two weeks later.
Of course, you can easily ignore my review and go on ahead and purchase this product.. but if something goes wrong, you WILL NOT be happy with their service. Customer service is a priority in a business and this one needs to get theirs straight!",1.0

"Look, you have to buy this because it's required for your class. It's expensive, it's unreliable, it breaks after 1 week of use (usually).

Here's a couple of tips:
1. Cover the serial number with nail polish, it will keep that scratch-off ink from disappearing so you cant sell it back.
2. If it doesn't work, check the batteries and slap it against your hand, if that doesn't work, turn it over and slap it against your hand. Keep repeating until it can either turn on or turns on automatically.
3. To change the channel, Hold down the ""ON/OFF"" key for a few seconds until it blinks, if the two digit code you type in is correct, the light will blink green.
4. DO NOT pack this anywhere it can get even light shocks, I like to keep it in the side pocket of my backpack since it cannot be hit there very easily.
5. Sell it back early, many students will try to sell it at the end of the semester so the price will drop dramatically. After the last in-class quiz (Check the syllabus or talk to the professor) run to the nearest bookstore or throw it up on eBay.
6. DO NOT BUY THE EXPENSIVE ""2.0"" version! This one works just fine (as long as your instructor allows it)

I bought this I-clicker for a class. Not only did it take 2 months for it to finally arrive(and by that time I had already bought a new one) but when it came it didn't have a back for the battery compartment and when I went to use it it didn't work :(,1.0

"Pro's:
cool color, fast shipping

Con's:
Considering that I paid the same price as a brand new iclicker I would hope & expect this one to be in good cosmetic condition... it looks like it was a child's toy that had been chewed on and tossed around. None of the buttons really line up or sit flush. Thank g-d it at least works.

Plus requiring attendance means all the children who got accepted to grown up school show up and chat through the entire lecture, throwing paper airplanes, interrupting the lecturer and sleep.

"Firstly, this item is a few dollars more expensive used than it is in my College's bookstore. This is astounding because the bookstore notoriously rips off everyone with prices over 200% higher than reasonable amazon prices all the time.

Secondly, it didn't work. I was unable after many, many attempts, even after asking for help, to set the iclicker to C/D frequency. Finally, once by pure accident it flashed green, but was not able to send the vote through and returned to being unable to set the correct frequency. Just be aware that the product may not work. Also it showed up from a personal address, not anything related to amazon or anything that looked like an official business seller. Very sketchy... very sketchy indeed.

"I have several issues with the iclicker. First, it is way overpriced, considering it is really just a remote, similar to the one you use for your TV, except it only has 6 buttons. It should not be sold for $40. Furthermore, it's stupid that a lot of professors require all their students to buy one just so they can participate in clicker questions. Why not just have people raise their hands like back in the good old days? Also, the website for iclicker SUCKS. I challenge you to go on their website right now and browse through it; try clicking through different links. I just did when I was registering my iclicker and I noticed several links that directed users to the wrong page. Lastly, they have you register your clicker with a little flimsy sticker on the back of the clicker that easily falls off and if you lose it you are screwed. They have a ""tool"" to look up your number if the sticker falls off, but it doesn't even work. Overall, this is an overpriced piece of garbage. Professors should stop making their students spend their own money to buy these.",1.0
I had to purchase this for a class in college. It worked fine but I couldn't use it in any of my other classes. I would have rathered had the opportunity to rent (which was not an option) it for my class instead of buying on and using it one time and then have it stuffed away in my desk.,1.0

Be warned, it is a VERY cheap feeling piece of plastic that is made in China.  The LED lights bleed through the other LED light openings, the plastic mold isn't precise, the plastic is literally the same stuff they make disposible silverware out of.  The button springs each feel different and off... meaning the clicking mechanism built into the clicker is inprecise and will be very prone to failure.

This device was made with zero quality control or care in China out of the cheapest plastic made.  I would be suprised if it cost over $1 in total to make.  Yet students are charged nearly $40 for it.

I don't care how useful it might be, it is a total scam and ripoff.  It should cost less than $10.",1.0
"I am absolutely convinced that I had a faulty clicker after my final ""clicker"" score in class for this semester was a shocking 57.6% (F). These results are extremely questionable since I know I got my answers correct 95% of the time and would always sit in class with a smug satisfaction that now has turned into furious anger and upset. I am a 4.0 student and I do the work, which is why my complaint should be given merit. I am not blaming my own shortcomings as a student on the results I acheived with the use of this device, I am blaming the device itself. Something has gone terribly awry, but it cannot be corrected or fixed and I have to live with this poor score that I am 100% convinced is inaccurate. My A in my college course has now become a very disappointing B and caused my 4.0 average to sink.

I work very hard to get good grades and I do the work, the use a faulty iclicker just cost me a place on the President's List.",1.0
"When my tv remote broke last winter, I was a little skeptical about spending $10 to buy a new one. But when I got to sit in on my physics class and realize that I could buy the exact same item, but without the clutter of having more than 6 buttons, for only 4x as much money, then I started to get excited! This little clicker is a god-send, it exactly like a universal remote, except it's such an specialized universal remote that it can only tune in on one thing, the i-clicker receiver and that's why it is such a bargin!

  Fear not though, my classmates and I found several other uses for it, we could play Starwars, rub two together to star a fire, it helped me train my dog, I used it as a back scratcher, and it's also the best paperweight ever!

  The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because my remote accidently hit 1 (I use it to type because I don't like excess pressure on my fingers) and I just can't find out how to change this vote back to 5.",1.0
DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON. I PAID FOR ONE DAY SHIPPING AND IT ARRIVED TWO WEEKS LATER. I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR THE START OF MY CLASSES.

"My university requires the use of i<Clickers for most classes.  They have many problems.  Mine sometimes won't turn on, or will turn off instead of registering my answer.

"First off The Clicker works like it's suppose to, No problem there.

My problem is the thought of even buying a clicker in addition to the power it gives rude professors.

The price is way too high for a device that no college should ever use. I can understand using this in preschool, but not college. When did a 30 cent Scantron become outdated?  Great what's next in the money making schemes against college students?

One thing that this device does is puts the power in the hands of an instructor. For example, with a scantron, the professor hands out the test and you take the test at your own speed. However, with this junk, it allows arrogant and incompetent professors the ability to walk into the classroom and say TAKE OUT YOUR Clickers you have 20 seconds to answer question number one on the projector!!! After 20 seconds, question number one is blacked out. Ok Class, you have 15 seconds to answer question number 2 on the projector. etc etc. It takes me 15 seconds to read the question, let alone read it and chose the correct answer so this was a big problem for me, even though I passed the class with a good grade. This way of test taking is not acceptable and in my opinion it makes money off of college students while also supplying ammo for not so nice professors. Remember college is a business(worthy of fortune 500 status) that likes to see students repeat the same courses for extra money. Devices like this can help a professor and school dictate the ""Grade Curve"" that many colleges predict their students to fall in.

There was plenty of room on the page to have produced this properly, in a larger, more readable format. Why the manufacturer did it this way is beyond me. I've purchased the Peanuts day-to-day calendar before in years past, and each comic strip was more of a ""normal"" size for each page. This one isn't. Awful production.",1.0

Changes from 2010 to 2011:
Weeks from 7 days to 6 days
Sunday from a double (6 panel strip) to non-existence
Saturday/Sunday from 2 days, 9 panels to 1 day, 3 panels.

2011 Statistics:
156 - 12.5% fewer panels
52 - 15% fewer days/pages

And the new 2011 binding is garbage. The pages separate in 1 big lump, from the cheap paper strip binding.

The heck with us; we're just the consumers.",1.0
"The plastic ""easel"" on the back first ceased to work. Then, the paper calendar fell off the plastic backing - the binding at the top failed. That being said, the substance of ""Dilbert"" is great - the manufacturing of the calendar itself is just bad.",1.0
"This is the third year in a row that I have bought a Dilbert page-a-day calendar. I love the Dilbert comics and being able to wake up every day and read one in the morning is very enjoyable. It's always good to start your day with a smile. I loved the Dilbert calendars I used for the past couple years.

However this years calendar is beyond horrible. It looks like it was designed by a three year old and was then outsourced to China for printing and assembly. I will explain:

1. Craftsmanship - When I got the calendar in the mail, I took it out and tried to set it up. The cover and binder promptly fell off the calendar, it now has the glue backing that the pages are stuck to exposed on the top. Since the calendar attached to the plastic stand with sticky glue on the back cover, the calendar doesn't ""stick"" to the plastic stand anymore, since it only has the glue and pages left.

2. Where's Sunday? - For whatever illogical and inconceivable reason, they removed Sunday from the calendar. They combined the weekends into one page, so now you have pages for ""Mon"", ""Tue"", ""Wed"", ""Thu"", ""Fri"", ""Sat/Sun"". I can't understand why they did this. The whole reason I use page-a-day calendars is because I can never remember what the date or day of the week is. It is only through the habit of removing a page every morning that I have any clue what month/day/year I am living in. I'm serious. I don't keep track of time like other people do. So combining the weekends like this really throws me off.

3. The Font - The old Dilbert calendars had an easy to read font for the date and day of the week. They used a bold black font on a white background, something that everyone is accustomed to and can read easily. Now they have a thinner black font with a white highlight on a lime green background. It actually is harder to read, especially when you wake up in the morning. The obnoxious orange seal on the bottom right of every page with Scott Adams name only adds to the visual aggravation.

To conclude, the calendar is in almost every way horrible. I love the Dilbert strips, and the strips are the only enjoyable thing about this. I will be shopping around for another page-a-day calendar to use, and probably won't buy another Dilbert one. I think one of these days when I am bored I will go through and read all the strips in this one, and then throw it out.",1.0
"Hey Scott Adams, I have a great idea for a Dilbert strip where Dilbert unboxes his new calendar and sees that saturday and sunday are now combined into one page. I can't think of a punchline, I'll leave that to you--you're the pro at this!

I actually clicked on the one star reviews just to see what kind of whiner would generate a 1 star review. I'm glad I did so I didn't have to buy this calendar. I refuse to buy this calendar until Sunday comes back.",1.0
"What happened to this calendar??  Did the pointy-haired boss make it?  was it outsourced to Elbonia??  either way, this is the WORST Dilbert calendar I can remember.  As soon as I opened it I got excited to see everything in color.  Then I actually looked at the first page, only to find Saturday and Sunday are now just one comic.  Which means 52 less comics AND no extended Sunday comic.  Then I noticed there is no daily extra on the back.  There were days I enjoyed that as much the comic. And this was all before I even set the calendar on my desk.  Believe it or not, it got worse.  As soon as I put the calendar on the desk, it fell apart.  So now I have a poor quality calendar with less comics and less info then last year.  HUGE disappointment.

Last years calendar would have gotten 5 stars from me.  This years has less comics and less extras.  So I dropped it to 2-3 stars.  However, when it fell apart before I could even rip the first comic off, that was the last straw.  I would give it ZERO stars if I could!  Whoever makes this better step up their game or I'll have to find myself another daily calendar.",1.0
"Let's see, the 2011 calendar has 52 fewer pages than last year, no extended Sunday strips, less room to write notes, no extra material on the back.  Verdict: huge disappointment.",1.0
"For several years I have kept theses calendars in my bathroom.  Every morning I weigh myself, flip the calandar page to today's date, write down my weight, read the comic strip and throughout 2010, glance at the previous day's puzzle, joke or quotation.  Imagine my disappointment this morning when I opened my new 2011 calandar to discover that today was SAT/SUN.  I suppose I'll have to insert slashes between my weekend weighings in 2011 and forego the extended Sunday strip and the daily trivia.  But you can be sure this will be the last year I use Andrews McMeel desktop calendars.",1.0
"Saturday and Sunday is now combined.  I've been getting this calendar for the past 10 years and all of a sudden it's been downsized just like everything else in the world!  A one pound can of coffee is now 10.5 oz, a 7.5 oz can of tuna is now 5 oz, a 1/2 gallon if ice cream is now 1.5 quarts, a 30 minute TV show used to have an actual run time of 26 minutes and 20 seconds...  A 30 minute show is now down to 21 minutes 40 seconds!  Nothing's safe anymore.  I never thought a calendar could be downsized!!  Shame on Andrews McMeel Publishing!  What's next?  Gas being sold at $3.50 for 3.5 quarts?  A yardstick with a length of 34 inches?  BTW, even though there are 14% less comics, the price is the same!!!  I'm calling the publisher and will get an address to send it back directly to them!  I don't want a refund.  I'm more interested in expressing my disgust!",1.0
"I love the comics.  I just thougt I'd mention that the publisher has changed the format on all of their ""day to day"" calendars.  Sat/Sun has now become 1 day so you get fewer comics and this is much less useful as an actual event calendar.  In fact I usually have more stuff planned on the weekends than during the week.",1.0
"This isn't a rating of the content of the calendar, it was fine. This is a rating of the quality of the item I received. Upon opening the box, it was apparent that the actual calendar was not glued into the casing and it fell out immediately when I stood the stand in the upright position.
However, I am not returning the item because Amazon lists it as ""no longer in print"" and it was a gift for my husband. He would rather try to glue it back together than not have one at all.",1.0

"The 2010 calendar was one of the best, the way it was put together, the bonus features on the back of each page, and unlike the UK version full colour and seperate pages for Saturday and Sunday.

Based on that i had no hestiation on ordering up this 2011 one, oh dear, the bonus stuff on each page has gone, Saturday/Sunday now share a page, but only has the one cartoon - no Sunday strips this year (the UK version at least has two strips on it's weekend page - well it did haven't seen the 2011 UK one yet)

And the whole thing fell apart the moment i got it out the box. Terrible - what happened? What were they thinking when they took a great product and reduced it to this, was the pointy haird boss involved this year?

The only plus - 4 day delivery from US to UK, it's beaten my Amazon UK orders, that were placed on the same day!

Sorry folks but be wary if you buy this product based on past calendars, this one falls way short of the standard set in previous years, get the UK one, a set of crayons and have fun colouring them in this coming year instead!",1.0
"The front of the 2011 calendar has a cartoon on it where Dilbert says, ""I want my unwarranted optimism back.""  I can't think of a better way of describing my reaction to this product.

I took it out of the box, lifted the cover and the pages of the calendar fell out.  At least they fell out as one unit and not as individual pages, but that doesn't make it a whole lot better.  The pages of the calendar are in no way connected to the backing.  To display the calendar, I just have the ""block"" of pages sitting on the ledge of the plastic stand.  I think this is going to work, but it's just shoddy workmanship.

"As a canine, I am generally indifferent to that succession of sounds known as music. As far as I'm concerned, it's just more of the day-to-day surface noise that amuses my masters along with the television, the cell phone and whatever appliances they are currently operating.

That said, there is one aspect of the alleged masterpiece under review in which I have a unique perspective: the period of silence at the conclusion of ""A Day in Life"" which supposedly includes a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone that only dogs can hear. No less an authority than the redoubtable Paul McCartney has stated: ""If you ever play Sgt. Pepper, watch your dog.""

This is, alas, just the kind of information that turns my master into a first class bore, given his incessant interest in the intellectual capabilities of, ahem, the lesser animals, specifically the seven-pound Toy French poodle who is just now trying his paw at musical criticism. No sooner does the old boy read some nonsense on the computer than he has me on his lap, petting me, rubbing my belly -- all fine and well, of course -- and then queuing up the song so the two of us can have a good listen. ""Do you hear anything, Charlie, do you hear anything?"" Of course, I can't hear squat for his yammering, so he plays it over. And over. And over -- mainly because I give the occasional growl, which he soon realizes is just me warding off the mailman's daily terrorist attack.

I can fully understand his hopeful enthusiasm. I'm a poodle, proud member if the second smartest breed, and you'd think if any dog could make head it tail out of Sir Paul's little japery it would be the furry diminutive beast typing up this most brilliant review. Alas, I think I speak for all my four-footed friends in saying these fifteen seconds or so are of no more interest than the rest of the record.

Certainly, it doesn't hold a candle to my own favorite top three songs, all of which feature actual audible barking, and which continue to trip me up every time. At the top of the list, of course, is ""Dogs"" by Pink Floyd, from the art-rock masterpiece Animals. Can't go wrong with that one. Then, of course, there is the demo version of Bob Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand"" on The Bootleg Series Vols. 1-3 - now there's a dog I'd like to meet. Also, I'm quite taken with the vocal stylings of John Fahey's beloved pooch in ""Poor Boy"" on The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death, whose alert and playful yaps are so distinct that the great guitarist has to ""shhh"" him. Now that, truly, is a dog whose rear end I would sniff heartily.

Sgt. Pepper is, by my master's standards, something on the order of brilliant, and if that's your thing, well, go for it. But dogs and masters looking for a bonding experience are best advised to look elsewhere.",1.0

"While Sgt. Pepper's is one of the most influential and well-crafted pieces of music in the modern era, this CD is to be avoided. To play it on a Windows computer requires the installation of Quicktime, a buggy piece of software that is an open conduit for malware. There are no individual audio tracks on the CD; no .wav files, no MP3s. You must use Quicktime or, on Linux the free and open source VLC player. Even then, the audio breaks up continuously during playback. The whole point appears to prevent you from getting fair use of the music you have purchased. While I have never done so before, with the nefarious and inferior nature of this CD I must recommend you buy the tracks elsewhere or pirate them.

"I am sure that a perfectly pressed copy of this is quite wonderful. Unfortunately, mine were not one of those. I say ""mine"" because I have exchanged(3)copies of this already with no luck. I was able to hear side 2 without any issues so I know it can sound great. I have four other titles of this reissue set and I am very happy with those.

The problems with the Pepper album seem to be the same. They all seem to be on side one. Most of the other reviewers have described the same problems.

This is what I think the problem is. Most of the later albums like Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album are the ones that seem to be having the most problems. I think that the pressing plant over pressed these records on worn stampers because these were going to be the most in demand. This historically has been a problem with hot selling records. No quality control just to get the numbers out. To the manufacturers, its all a numbers game anyway. Back in the 1970's, I had to return 10 copies of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti before I was able to get a decent one when it first came out.

Once the dust settles, I'm sure a lot of these problems will be resolved and will go away. I am not going to give these reissues a bad rap just because of few bad pressings. I have heard enough of this record to know that I still want it. As soon as I can find another the plays properly, I am going to grab it.

I have been buying these separately to avoid the problems with trying to buy the perfect box set.

Update:

I recently ordered another copy from Amazon,(4th)copy. This was the worst one so far. I am beginning to believe that there isn't a good copy anywhere. I will give it another try before I throw in the towel.

Final Update:

""Praise Be"" I finally was able to get a hold of a good copy of this title, and it sounds good. I was beginning to think that one did not exist.

Although frustrating, I think that Rainbo should get another chance. All the other LP's of this issue that I got were superb. What all this feedback is telling me is that vinyl is truly on a comeback course. A project like this should have been spread out among several of the pressing plants. It's too much for one pressing plant, even for the likes of RTI and others to have the pressure of 100% quality control. I don't know how may vinyl pressings were actually done, but I am sure that it was way more than the normal 5000 to 10000 pressings that a regular reissue might receive. Let hope that if EMI decides to do another ""Mono"" reissue set, they will learn some of the lessons of this and spread the job out a bit.

Mystery Solved?

I had been wondering why I seemed to be the only one having problems with this pressing from the local record shops in my area. Nobody else seem to have the same problems.

 A recent event may have solved this mystery. I recently switched out cartridges and replayed my distorted copy of this record. For what ever reason, this record sounded fine with the different cartridge. The previous cartridge was an Audio Technica fitted with a shibata tip stylus. The new cartridge was a Pioneer fitted with an eliptical tip stylus. Both cartridges are in good working order.

So if you are having problems with the sound on this record and you have a cartridge with a shibata or microline tip, this may be the problem. Those tips may be picking up distortion further down in the groove. You may want to try this out using a different phono cartridge. I would be interest if anyone else comes to the same concludion",1.0

"Something that has kept recurring to me for decades (but I almost always hold my peace ... piece?):

Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band sucks.

... as bad as any disco Bee Gees, ... worse, at least you could dance to that. ... and maybe even get ... uh..lucky. But SPLHCB (jeeze, even the acronym sounds like someone losin' their lunch) is the most overrated crap ever inflicted on the music-buying public - that's millions and millions worldwide. Even me ... and I bought the CD long after I realized this. What a sap!

Let's think about this in an analytical fashion-

1. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
- A jingle, a commercial, but any 60's Fritos commerial has a better hook and more artistic integrity.

2. With A Little Help From My Friends
-The oom-pah begins. Maybe Englishmen liked this kind of crap before they heard Bo Diddly, but this is 1967, c'mon ... pure white bread with a little sugar. Joe Cocker must have recognized its wretchedness and so covered it like Coltrane ripped My Favorite Things. Not buying my bs? ....

Beatles:
[Just listen to any one of the dozen old or ""new"" ""remastered"" releases that we chumps all just keep a-buying.]

Cocker:
[Do a video search for ""Joe Cocker - With a little help from my friends"" just like that, on that popular video site, the URL of which I can't post in a review.]

Case closed on that one. (If you're still unconvinced, you need a lot more help than your friends are likely trained or qualified to give.

3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
-LSD? Lennon's childhood? ... Did Phil Spector sneak into the studio? ...Who cares?

4. Getting Better
-No, it's not. oom-pah, oom-pah, speeded up and accented ...
I'm getting sleepy.

5. Fixing A Hole
- It's warm, it's cozy, I'm asleep.

6. She's Leaving Home
-Okay (yawn). But Dylan said it far better three years earlier in just one line: ""Come mothers and fathers throughout the land, and don't criticize what you can't understand"" ... okay, two lines.

7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite
-Really good, ... for when you really need a good dose of circus music.

8. Within You Without You
-Best cut on the album. Damn. George Harrison noodling around on a sitar is the best damn cut on a Beatles album. ...Damn.

9. When I'm Sixty Four
-I guess this oom-pah oom-pah drivel probably WAS appreciated by folks who were 64 in '67, but the rest of us were suckers.

10. Lovely Rita
-Ground-breaking fusion of oom-pah, munchkin music, and wall-of-sound.

11. Good Morning Good Morning
-Finally, entertainment! ...but the entertainment is watching my dog go bat-shite crazy at the animal sounds. Is this a Mc Donald's commercial or something now?

12. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)
- A reprise, yet, for those who didn't get it the first time. Even Hendrix couldn't save this one.

13. A Day In The Life
- A good song. Should have been released as a single - the B-side to Within You Without You.

So, there you have it. Two keepers, 11 jokes.

It was all in the packaging: First album (LP) cover ever great for cleaning reefer. After the brilliant Rubber Soul and Revolver, in 1967, that was enough.

"This band has long since been lauded as the greatest band of their time, but with a closer look at the 60's era of music, it becomes apparent that the Beatles were surrounded by bands that were artistically superior to them. Bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Doors and The Who all displayed greater technical proficiency than The Beatles. The Beatles had some pleasant instrumental passages, but they seem pale in comparison to the transcendental instrumental passage of `Light My Fire' by The Doors. Out of all of their psychedelic music, none of it was as surreal and mind-bending as Pink Floyd's instrumental `Interstellar Overdrive' or Jefferson Airplane's hallucinogenic march-like anthem `White Rabbit'. While other bands used psychedelia as a medium to create powerful and original statements in music, The Beatles merely recycled circus music clichs and molded it into silly pop music such as they did with `Benefit of Mr. Kite'. In terms of lyrics, they seem shallow and dim-witted when contrasted to Dylan's poetry. Their messages were often trite and meaningless and reflected nothing of the revolution that was taken place during that time. Captain Beafheart, with his savage and seemingly demented - bordering on atonal - music of his masterpiece `Trout Mask Replica', painted a vivid picture of the heat of the turbulent revolution during late 60's and is a much more striking statement of that time than anything The Beatles had done. I'm not alone here. The following passage is taken from a review of `Lick My Decals Off' by Lester Bangs - who is undisputedly the greatest American rock critic:

""I'm gonna go not so very far at all out on a limb and say that Captain Beefheart is the most important musician to rise in the Sixties, far more significant and far-reaching than the Beatles, who only made pretty collages with material from the public domain, when you get right down to it""

Out of all the arguments defending The Beatles, I found none of them convincing. Most of these arguments do nothing other than illustrate very minor and insignificant technical innovations - most of which could have been easily done by just about any other descent rock band of the time. Whatever you think of these minor innovations, it doesn't change the fact that The Beatles almost always conformed to the simple verse-chorus-verse format of pop music. They placed their entire emphasis on melodic vocalization - nothing wrong with that in itself, but, with the Beatles music, it all sounds really banal. Their melodic pop songs are, for the most part, only a small step away from `Mary Had a Little Lamb'. Their voices are nice-sounding and agreeable but, to me, their vocal ranges seem very limited and their technical craftsmanship is weak. The music of the Beatles just seems dumbed-down, overly simplistic and - like a like plate of macaroni - it can be consumed without any intellectual strain whatsoever. And I think that's precisely why Beatles have risen to fame. People are taken in too easily by the Beatles `charm' but, with a closer look, it is evident that there is not much depth to their music. Serious art involves a tremendous amount of contemplation. But I wonder what there is to contemplate about with a ridiculous song like `Yellow Submarine'.",1.0

"This really is an awful album from start to finish. For a start, the title is very misleading. I thought I was buying an album called ""Beatles"" by a brass band named ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" only to learn when I got home and played it that it was the opposite!

Then there are the terrible songs, starting with the title track. The best part is the tuning up at the beginning, and then the singer says he's going to introduce us to ""the one and only Billy Shears"", but the song ends before we ever get to hear Billy sing. What a disappointment!! ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" is exactly what Ringo needs to make this song interesting. Not a patch on Joe Cocker's original! Then there is ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", or LSD in other words. What? A song about pounds, shillings and pence? Give us a break please!! Next is ""Getting Better"". No it's not, it's getting worse! ""Me used to be angry young man. Me hiding me head in the sand""? So you should mate, with appalling grammar like that! ""Fixing A Hole"" next. Only another 3999 to go then if you're fixing it in Blackburn, Lancashire! ""She's Leaving Home"", probably after being given this album as a present by her mum & dad. Give me Billy Bragg's original anytime! ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite"". What sort of title is that? And ""The Hendersons will dance and sing"". Not Dickie Henderson I hope, 'cos he's crap! ""Within You Without You"". Er, without you thanks, George. If I want to listen to this kind of music, I'll go to an Indian restaurant! ""When I'm 64"". Sounds like you already are, Paul, on this jolly old codger's ditty! ""Lovely Rita"". ""Got the bill and Rita paid it""? You tight git!! ""Good Morning Good Morning"". Good job there is a cockerel on it. It woke me up!! ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)"". Still no Billy Shears! Finally, we have ""A Day In The Life"".

"The 2009 remaster is not worth buying unless:

* You don't own the same album already on CD.
* You are an audiophile who is willing to pay big bucks for small improvements.
* You like collecting stuff and want the cardboard and booklets that come with the new version.

Everyone who is saying there is a dramatic audible difference between this release and the previous CD is wrong. I'm not saying their opinion differs from mine, I'm saying they're wrong. That's a strong statement, and I'll try to back it up without getting too geeky.

The Beatles remasters are a little louder than the 1987 CD releases. Music sounds better as it's turned up a little louder (up to the point where it starts to annoy the listener). Most people don't have a way to exactly volume-level the two releases to compare them. That's why they think the new ones are so much improved, when they're only slightly improved.

<geek mode on>

Conventional wisdom is that most people cannot detect a loudness change of less than 3 decibels. That's not quite right--most people cannot detect a volume change of less than 3dB AS A VOLUME CHANGE. They can hear the difference but they think it's something other than a difference in loudness. They think they're hearing more detail, better bass, etc.--and they are, because you can hear everything better when it's louder, and you'll like it better (up to that annoyance point).

When you go to an audio store to buy speakers, the salesman typically has a vested interest (commission) in steering you toward a particular speaker. The unscrupulous ones will set things up so their pet speakers are 1 to 2 decibels louder than the others.  They don't push it too far, or people will detect that it's a loudness difference and ask to turn up the other speakers that the salesman wants to steer you away from.

The differences between the old and new recordings are not large, and the new recordings certainly haven't been ruined by being made a little hotter. You can easily measure the volume differences by ripping the albums to your computer with a program that can compute replaygain values. The differences on most of the Beatles tracks are....less than 3 dB. See where I'm going with this? The new recordings are louder, but not enough louder for many people to perceive the difference as a loudness difference.

For example, the 1987 version of Come Together from Abbey Road has a track replaygain value of -2.88. The remaster is -3.93, or 1.05 dB louder. (In the replaygain scale, things get louder as the negative numbers get bigger. Many horribly limited modern pop recordings have replaygain values of -8 or worse. Uncompressed audiophile classical recordings typically have replaygain values near zero or even a dB or two above zero.)

I ripped the new Beatles remaster to FLAC lossless format, storing replaygain values, and compared the new recording to my 1987 CD copy through a Logitech Squeezebox with Smart Gain enabled. This means I was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level. I also played them against each other with volume leveling off, and done this way it's easy to see why most people prefer the new release.

<geek mode off>

When volume-matched, the difference between the old CDs and the new remasters is audible AND minimal. And occasional. The most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower end.

We're owed better than this for all this money and hype. At the least, we should have gotten something as good as the Yellow Submarine remixes. Nobody who has heard Eleanor Rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original. Love and the Yellow Submarine remix and Let It Be Naked and the damn XBox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know it.

They're milking us. Are you a cow?",1.0

I give it all props for that, but heres the thing, it does not have enought hits to justify the FORGETTABLE songs that this album has. The majority of the songs are experimental but forgettable.

"Sorry to offend all you Beatles loving Hippies, but the truth must be told!  The Beatles are the most overhyped, overrated, annoying band in history.  Songs like these take no talent to play, they take no talent to perform, and they take no talent to compose.

Formulaic and uninspired, the Lennon/McCartney partnership has concocted some of the most simplistic, uncreative, insipid melodies ever commited to vinyl.  I've often heard their music described as ""simple"", but I think ""simple minded"" would be a more accurate description.  After all, simplicity can be a good thing.  But the Lennon/McCartney partnership didn't write any songs that were simple in a good way.  Rather, they wrote songs that were just plain simple minded, both musically and lyrically.  Twelve barre song structures, redundant three chord riffs, and some of the most brainless lyrics imaginable:

""She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah

She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah

She loves you

Yeah yeah yeah""

Wow!  The creativity really was rolling on that song!  As you can see, the Lennon/McCartney writing team draws heavilly from the classics, such as ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", and ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" for their stunning lyrical complexity!  What ever caused their brilliant minds to think of those words!?  Sheer lyrical genius!

Can't you people put aside your nostalgia and start seeing The Beatles for what they really were?  They were nothing more than a juvenile acting, silly looking, musically amateurish garage band----hand picked at random out of a hundred other no talent bands----and forced upon an unsuspecting public by a bunch of fat, balding, cigar smoking record company executives in suits and ties.  The fact that a corporate marketing scam like The Beatles remains so massively popular thirty five years after they disbanded is a testament to the power of marketing.  If you pay good money for a Beatles album, than you my friend, are a sucker.  Just like all their fans were back in the 60s!  I think PT Barnum put it best----""There's a sucker born every minute.""

The message given is ""Start A Revolution"" ""Do What Thou Will"", Those are teachings of Crowley, also notice the statue on the cover (bottom right under the BEETLES) That statue is mentioned in many of crowleys teachings. Guess who Sgt Pepper is... Yup Crowley!! Notice the lyric ""It was 20 years ago today...Sgt Pepper taught the band to play"" Just wanted to give a warning to those who didn't know! Why do you think this band got so big!!",1.0
"I don't get it. I really don't. How come this, of all the Beatles' albums, is considered such a pop masterpiece? No, not a pop masterpiece- a work of art? During the late 60s, there were a handful of albums that revolutionised the soundscape of the period : `Trout Mask Replica', `The Velvet Underground with Nico', 'Astral Weeks', `Pet Sounds' and 'The Band.' Let's not forget the umpteen psychedelic one-offs by garage bands captured on the Nuggets compilations. Sgt. Pepper don't even come close to those. The songs are mostly trite, silly, and boring. Even Macca's Frog Chorus thing of a couple of years back had a more memorable tune than most of the tracks on here. There are a few that are okay.' With A Little Help From My Friends' is pleasant enough, although Cocker's version is far superior - and that is hardly meant as a recommendation. 'Getting Better' is listenable. The rest are excruciating. `She's Leaving Home' just has to be the most sentimental tosh you will ever here in your life. It's a wonder Cilla Black never covered it.  `Lucy...' and `A Day in the Life' are the only songs that stand up to scrutiny.

It may appear as if I have no time for the Beatles. Not true. I think the Fab Four are one of the finest pop groups of the 60s and I heartily recommend such classics as `Abbey Road' and `A Hard Day's Night.' Sgt Pepper, however, I hate. I even hate the cover, which is fussy and scrappy.  The photographic portraits of Robert Freeman are far more striking and pleasing to the eye. Avoid this album as if it had a picture of your mother on the front - your mother naked!",1.0
"Say you were to go into a record store and you asked the clerk one question. ""Hey clerk, can you hand me a couple cds that were overhyped"". He'd should go get all Beatles albums and throw them in your hands. ""Take them all, we don't want them"". Only those stupid gullable people who actually beleive the Beatles can sing are the ones that want them.
Its a good thing their entire catalogue belongs to the genius himself, Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson made true music, this band reminds me of how overhyped Jessica Simpson and Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson is.
Now that the catalogue and rights to the songs are in Michael's hands, Paul McCartney can't put out any new Beatles music/compliation out there without Michael's permission. Michael would say no and Paul wouldn't even ask because they are in a bitter fight because Michael paid over 50 million dollars for the rights to the songs as well as rights to John Lennon and Paul McCartney catalogues. Michael was ripped off due to the fact that all Beatles song are not worth one scrap of poop from a dogs a**.",1.0

"I was born after the Beatles had long been disbanded.

"I do not understand how this album can be considered amazing. It has been declared an eclectic rock masterpiece, a statement which is simply not true. It was supposedly revolutionary because it was ""the first concept album.""  It also contained the spooky, thought provoking ending found in ""A Day in the Life"".  To each his own, I suppose.
The title track is surprisingly adequate; it is one of best songs by The Beatles (which is not saying much).  The second track is ""With a Little Help from my Friends"".  It, like most other songs from this album, is entertaining for one or two listens at best.  Then comes the random babbling entitled ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".  ""Getting Better"" and ""Fixing a Hole"" are more of this senseless garbage,only these include chiming guitars.  There's more clich material, found in the saccharine ""She's Leaving Home"".  Then comes yet another pointless throwaway, ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"".
""Within You Without You"" is another one of those unoriginal, interminable songs by George Harrison.  ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", ""Lovely Rita"", and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" more of the stale pop lyrics that The Beatles were so often praised for. We have a brief moment of coherence again with the reprise of the title track.  Then comes ""A Day in the Life"".  Somehow this song's ending is supposed to be genius.  Hmm, seems like more pointless noisemaking to me.
If this is the cultural revolution that everyone has talked about, then I now know why most pop/rock music stinks today.  If one does not like this review, that is fine.  As many of you apparently know, there is a Not Helpful button that one can press.",1.0
"So ....
Here's my , track by track , pass / fail analysis .
1. Title Track -  Upbeat kick-off . Fairly good . [pass]
2. With A Little Help From My Friends -  Ringo's song . The usual poor singing . Usually covered much better ( Joe Cocker etc .. ) . This version nothing special . [fail]
3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds -  Imaginative lyric over a repetitive verse/chorus pop tune . The song fails to sustain through the later choruses . John later claimed it had nothing at all to do with LSD etc .......  either way .... yawn . [fail]
4. Getting Better - By Beatles standards , a pretty ordinary/dull song . [fail]
5. Fixing A Hole - Another nothing-special track . [fail]
6. She's Leaving Home -  A sentimental ballad wraps a simple rejection/separation concept . Fine , but doesn't bear repeat listening . [fail]
7. ...Mr. Kite -  Silly lyrics ride a 'funfair' soundtrack . Again , really just the one idea  . Dull in repetition .[fail]
8. Within You Without You - Crap , compared to George's later efforts ( especially 'Dark Horse' )[fail]
9. When I'm 64 - Crap .[fail]
10. Lovely Rita... - Clever . Would have made a great single . [pass]
11. Good Morning... - Nice driving tight rock sound . [pass]
12. The Reprise - Great sound on this track . [pass]
13. A Day In The Life - More 'human condition' stuff from the can-be-rather-boring Mr. Lennon . Leads to a pompous resurrection of some orchestral experimentation from the 1920s . Embarrassing .[fail]
So , my totals are , 4 passes and 9 fails . Hence , only one star I'm afraid .",1.0
"'Sgt. Pepper' ranks as one of the most overrated albums of all time.  Not only is it a bad album, it is also a boring one.  Some of the songs are OK, but the rest of the album makes me want to fall asleep.  I think most people know that it is bad, but are afraid to admit it.",1.0

The poster I received was sent loosely rolled in an over sized box full of bubble wrap so that the rolled poster was squashed and bent and not suitable for display in my professional office. Beyond that the actual quality of the poster was not very nice, not at all laminated but just a heavy, dull paper. That said, it may have been acceptable if I were able to frame it. Unfortunately, it was too damaged to try to frame and I only had half of the set. Overall, the whole shopping experience on this one was a bad one and I have returned and will await a refund.

"The Apollo Challange is what you've been looking for in a diet and workout plan.  I'm a normal dude, played football in high school, club sports in college.  Fair to say that I was active but by no definition was I fit.  I held onto my freshman 15 from college until I was 30!  I wanted and needed to lose fat, not just weight.  Enter the Apollo Challenge.  28 days of an easy to follow meal plan, 3 workouts a week and the best sleep you've ever had.

I lost 10+ lbs, built significant muscle mass and I look better naked.  Give this program a shot, it's built to give you results quickly and believe me when I tell you, the weight actually stays off.

Lastly, you'll be well supported.  Their website and YouTube channel show you the lifts you'll be performing, even examples of meals to cook and prepare throughout the program.

Great program with solid results.",5.0
"At age 31, the Apollo Challenge was a gamechanger for me. I started the challenge while in really poor shape, coming home from a very indulgent vacation, and battling nagging injuries. I hadn't weighed more or been in worse shape  in my life.

The Apollo Challenge provided a clear-cut structure that I could follow on my own each day and respected my time and my workouts. The system was easy to follow, shop for, and track progress. The book is a quick and easy read (it took me no more than an hour to finish reading it), and it worked great as a portable day-to-day manual to follow the plan everywhere I went. I followed the Apollo Challenge for the first 28 days religiously, and it completely changed my dietary habits.

I noticed rapid gains in the increased amount of weight I could lift and the decreased weight on the scale. Even though I did't see as much direct weight loss as I would have hoped, I dropped 3-1/2 inches from my waist, and added 1-1/2 inches to my arms. The Challenge promises a significant change in body composition, and it absolutely delivers.

Buy this book.

I still use the system, albeit on a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule, and I have maintained my progress. It keeps me eating healthy and staying active. It changed my mindset and approach to food in a manageable system.

... Yes, I look better naked.

"If you're interested in exploring any area of New York beyond the metropolitan areas, this Delorme Atlas and Gazetteer is your best bet. Over the years I've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states, and they've come in handy when exploring out-of-the-way places, as I'm fond of doing. For me, this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks. I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas, thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads, and also show hiking trails. Because the maps are topographical, I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter, particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory. While I've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks, it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows.",5.0

"I try to hike in the Catskills 2-3 times each month. The iOS maps app is great for getting me to the proper GPS point for the trailheads. The trouble is the return trip: in the remote areas I hike, it's unlikely that I'll have data service when it comes time to head home. No data service = no navigation. Having a USA road atlas in the car is great for getting from state to state or city to city, but it does you no good on small country roads. The scale of this map, however, does let you see those smaller roads.

This is in my car and stays in my car. It's a beautifully rendered set of maps that map geeks will just love.

"Jack Purcell is pretty thorough in his review.  As for the nitpickers, if they really want to get names and numbers of backroads, they can contact the forest service and BLM, as well as the park service, who publishes maps of logging roads, and other limited use roadways.  At 1:250,000, who could expect a name or number tag anyway of off-the-beaten trail access roads anyway?
What's nice about the new edition is De Lorme has added graphics to note relief, rather than topo lines found on previous editions (Perhaps due to competition from Benchmark Maps).  I like the DeLorme Maps because they tend to be more detailed using a smaller resolution overall than other book maps (1:150,000 up to 1:250,000), and if one needs the detail offered in a 7.5 minute map, they have only to visit TopoZone.com to get really close, after locating the general area conditions on a DeLorme Map.

"Absolutely essential for the ""back roads"" traveler.  One of the first things I do when planing a road trip to an unfamiliar area is purchase the map of the state.  I like & use GPS but there are times when it doesn't work AND it has been known to ""lie"".  In addition, GPS does not allow one to see the ""big picture"" like a map does.",5.0

"The first Delorme atlas and gazetteer I ever purchased was years ago when my wife and I were planning a trip to the Keweenaw Peninsula (which juts out into Lake Superior from the U.P. of Michigan). Ever since I've made a practice of procuring a Delorme gazetteer before exploring a state. I find them most valuable for that purpose. And so, a few years back, when I knew we were going to be in the greater Phoenix area and were then heading to the Grand Canyon, I figured I would make sure I had an Arizona atlas so I could see more than just what I could observe from the major highways. With this Arizona gazetteer I discovered backroads that aren't found on a regular roadmap, hiking trails and trailheads, and other points of interest. Plus, because these are topographical maps, I knew in advance what sort of terrain we would be getting into before we headed into it. This was especially useful for when we were hiking.",5.0
"I purchased my first Delorme atlas and gazetteer several years ago when I was planning to spend time exploring parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was so well pleased with the detail and how with its aid I was able to navigate the area that I decided to get one of these atlases whenever I was going to spend time in a state. So, when I headed to Arizona to combine a visit with my daughter in the Phoenix area with a trip to the area around the Grand Canyon I made sure I had a gazetteer with me. Like the others I have, this one proved invaluable. I was able to discover backroads that aren't shown on the typical roadmap. Plus, I was able to locate hiking trails and trailheads, thus allowing me to fulfill another passion while on my visit. I'm especially grateful that this is a topographical map, since it gives me a better idea of what sort of terrain I'll be encountering, whether I'm driving or on foot. I consider this to be an essential tool for serious exploration of an area.",5.0
"This is a very useful general purpose atlas for the entire state of Arizona.  I'm sure there are a few omissions, but, overall, it's about as complete as you can reasonably hope.",5.0

I've also got the Northern and Southern California as well as the Kansas Delorme maps for the same reason.",5.0

Great tool. I'm a prospector and this is one of the best publications for finding all the back roads that I have found.,5.0
Helped us get around the Grand Canyon and more remote parts of Arizona where GPS systems can be deceptive or not work at all.,5.0
"I have done a lot of backroad/offroad driving in AZ in past 6 years and would not consider going without this book. We find many roads that are not on standard maps. The scale is so much greater and accuracy is unmatched. The only maps that can touch these are USFS maps.
I owned several of their Texas Atlases for 25 years while covering the state on canoeing trips for the same reasons and have checked out their New Mexico and Colorado books- same story.
They are a bit expensive but well worth the investment if you want to see parts of your area that you didn't know existed.",5.0
"Must have as a starter for general navigation. Main benefit is land status color coding - let's you know where to go to use YOUR public land. Decent off-road points of interest and features. For higher resolution, get USGS topographic maps and/or something like the Backcountry Navigator app. Also, USDI/BLM has Geocommunicator website with free topo map interface.",5.0

"I have always enjoyed the Atlas and gazeteers and purchased them for each state I have lived in, usually at least 2 copies. I keep one clean and the other gets notes and comments penned into it. Many times the field copy will get the pages carefully removed and laminated. I use them with other tools for hunting, fishing, trails, etc.",5.0
"I use this with my adventure book all the time.
Not as good as a topo, but close, and that is saying something.",5.0
"My wife and I have used these for years. I just wish they had them for other countries too. We've used the Michelin books and others, but they aren't as good because the scale is better. They are large books, but flat (18X12 inches). They wind up in my duffel bag as they can bend. I bought this one for a friend of mine coming to visit so he and his family could plan their vacation. It lists historic sites, natural scenes, camping places, etc. The maps show lighthouses which is really good as I photograph them and more importantly how to get there. They can be used with GPS though I am of the old school and have never found a real need for a GPS device. These map books and the human brain are adequate so far.",5.0
"If you do not own a GPS, or even if you do, You should have one of these.

Amazon came through on the low price once again.",5.0
"The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Arizona is a deceptively big state with lots of wide open spaces and some specially rugged terrain, including the Grand Canyon.  This atlas should allow the average traveler to navigate pretty much anywhere on the road network, and to gain some appreciation for the terrain along the way.  The scale of the map is 1:260,000, which is reasonably useful for the size of the state.  Major roads are identified, and many minor roads are at least visible on the map.  The multicolored presentation enhances the terrain relief.  The map sheets are marked with latitude and longitude for GPS grids.

In addition to a locational gazatteer, this Delorme Atlas provides general information on recreational opportunities.  The listings include federal and state parks, game management areas for hunting, and locations suitable for fishing.  There is a handy listing of campgrounds and one map devoted to the Grand Canyon, a major visitor attraction.  The map scale is not suitable for off-road navigation.  Those travelers planning to do off-road route finding are advised to consult more detailed products.

The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is very highly recommended for planning and navigating, whether for business or pleasure, around Arizona.",5.0
"This Delorme topographical sure beats out all the other maps I have been using. We do alot of back country riding on motorcycles and this map gives us a clear view of elevations, routes, etc.....",5.0
"i am a long time furey faithful.  his exercise programs both mental and physical have helped me become more of the person i want to be and i know that in the future they will help me even more.  i see a lot of talk about price in these reviews.  i don't care how much furey charges, if his price is too high for you, you are missing the boat.  combat conditioning is the simplest set of end all be all core exercises for complete health and fitness no matter your age, occupation, hobby or gender. his focus is getting you into great shape, cardiovascularly, muscularly and flexibly all in a one shot deal.  even better than combat conditioning the book, is combat conditioning the video/dvd where you see the man at work. visit [...] for a ton of eye opening knowledge, and if your concerned about price, don't bother.  just think of what you spend on fuel or junk food or any other such nonsense and your senses will come back to you if you are at all interested in your own health, strength and longevity.",5.0
"In this day and age of modern gyms, overpaid personal trainers and expensive workout outfits, etc., Combat Conditioning is just what I was looking for!  I got it two years ago and have established a fitness level that a gym membership couldn't do.

I'm a martial artist and the exercises in Combat Conditioning have given me great functional strength, explosive power, three times the flexibility and 4 times the stamina. The Hindu Squats were the saving-grace for my knees. I had a MCL tear a few years back and have always had to deal with pain, stiffness and instability. After getting Combat Conditioning and doing the Hindu Squats, my knees are stronger with more stability and the nagging pain has significantly decreased!

I have read some of these reviews on Combat Conditioning and there seems to be a gripe and whine about the price. But in comparison to an $800 per year gym membership, not to mention the gas to get to and from there ( I live in California), Combat Conditioning is cheap!!! It is well worth the price, in fact, it is under priced if you ask me. I'm paid something like $45 directly from Matt Furey's website and then later got the videos for $99. In total, $144 plus shipping and handling for a lifetime of fitness!! Are you kidding me?  I felt like I ripped off Matt Furey!",5.0
"Great excercises that can be interchanged for numerous workout possibilities.  I would highly suggest this title if you are interested in building functional strength.  Don't bother if you are just interested in a body builder look; this isn't about just getting the ripped look.

It is especially helpful because there are no additional weights or equipment necessary which makes it great for the traveler.",5.0
Very good information regarding fitness-the routine delivers a superior condition of fitness and strength. Furey is correct when he says the only you need to lift is your own.,5.0
Mixing this book with CC 1 and 2 and al kavadlo raising the bar its all you need.  Weight lifting is out bodyweight is in you build legendary inhuman strength.  Just remember everyday is training day!!!!,5.0
"Matt Furey's best-selling ""Combat Conditioning"" is an incredible work. It is basic and rudimentary, which may be misleading for some readers or prospects; however, the recommendations and guidelines for combining the myriad of highly effective exercises in the book, especially Furey's ""Royal Court,"" WILL aid you in your endeavors to quickly and efficiently lose excess body-fat, and build your muscular strength and endurance, as well as improve cardiovascular conditioning to a very substantial degree. It's not the most complete work on calisthenics or body-weight exercises, yet it does more than ""gets the job done.""

Personally, my neck pain (which has troubled me for years) dissipated after nearly two weeks of performing the ""Royal Court"" only five days a week in less than 10 minutes each day. Of course, if you have neck pain (or any other pain, for that matter) you should consult a physician before adopting this program.

Also, keep in mind Matt Furey is a world-class grappling champion and National title-holder in wrestling, so his methodology is geared towards conditioning, not bodybuilding or pure strength and power. It will increase strength, but is has more to do with developing muscular and cardiovascular endurance - or ""staying power"" - than it does brute strength. This type of stamina is the most important facet of physical fitness for a grappler/ wrestler because if you're physical stamina is shot, so is your mental stamina, your ability to focus and give 100%. Obviously, it should go without saying that this benefit spills over into your everyday life as well.

Basically, ""Combat Conditioning"" is all you need to get great results, especially if you're goal is muscular energy and stamina that won't quit, improved mental focus, and a new-found confidence. Follow Furey's advice in the book, and his recommendations and you'll gain the fitness you desire.",5.0
"So Mr. Furey promotes himself...I'm in great shape, and the exercises beat me down! Try performing 100 straight Hindu squats! No way! You couldn't pay me to sell this book! It's a keeper! [...]",5.0
"You can read all the good and bad reviews, but this book works. It may not be the ""best looking"" book, but who cares? If you want results, pick it up. Getting fit isn't glamorous. As for Matt's price, it's worth it. Go join a gym, get a trainer, and tell me how much you'll pay for that! This book is no frills and is GREAT!",5.0
"I just received this book, and just the first three core exercises are worth what I paid for it. The exercises is this book will kick your butt, no matter what your skill level. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",5.0
"This book rocks.  I have been training for most of my life and have competed in marathon running and kick-boxing. (Western Canadian Welter weight title in 1998) I started doing these exercises 2 years ago and really noticed the difference in my muscular endurance.  After 10 months of combat conditioning, and age 47, I climbed Mt. Rainier (14,000 feet).  While running and weights are good training, I have to admit, the combat conditioning gave me the legs and lungs to top Mt. Rainier.

Doug Setter, BSc, author of Stomach Flattening and One Less Victim",5.0
I feel that this book was worth the reading and the excercises are fairly difficult but easyenough for anyone to do them,5.0
"I have a lot of Matt Furey's martial arts tapes as well as this book.
His tapes have a lot of good moves but the video quality is not all that good and they are pricey for what they show.
This book is somewhat high too but it delivers a lot of good exercises.
Matt has a web site where he pushes his goods such as Farmer Burns wrestling videos and things like inner circle memberships.
He will deliver an email to your mailbox if you sign up for it.
  All that being said I fell out a little bit when after I ordered some dvd's during a Christmas sale a few years ago and he sent me vhs tapes.  This happened on two different occasions.  It was apparent he was just getting rid of the tapes in an effort to only warehouse the way of the future, DVD's.
  I also want you to know he got big lifting weights and although bodyweight exercises are a great way to get in shape and even get strong, he is somewhat hypocritical in the way he puts down weight lifting.
  The third thing that aggravates me is the way some advocates of lifting heavy objects will also peddle their own version of goods in some of his daily emails.  They two have a bodyweight line and put down lifting weights in one set of books and advocate it in others.
  Still, this is a good book and I do recommend it.  Just know that although it is a good way to get back in shape or build up your endurance, the author is a bit two faced when it comes to his putting down weight lifting.",5.0
"Like Thomas F. Brown, I am one of the Furey Faithful.  Over the past few months, I have been using the exercises on a regular basis, and I am in the best shape I've ever been in.  I don't understand why people are complaining so much about the price.  For $30-40, you get a book full of great exercises that you can do anywhere, without any equipment.

"This book is a must-own for horse lovers, history lovers, and anyone who likes a good story.  There is a story for each of the 50 states - a unique format that suits the subject matter very well. I like the length of the stories - just right for taking a ""reading break"". You can read one story in a ten-minute sitting. The presentation is beautiful. It is a hard cover book with a beautifully designed dust jacket. The paper has a luxurious feel - it is a pleasure to turn the pages. The oblong format allows this to be displayed as a coffee table book, but the size is not cumbersome to hold as some coffee table books are. The content of the stories ranges from informative to heartwarming to thrilling. You come away from reading this book with a renewed pride in America and a new appreciation for the horse that helped make America great.

"Usually, we don't take the time to learn things until there is an absolute need or emergency, and don't let that be the case with this book. This book will endow you with useful survival knowledge in tough situations and some of these tips can save your life before it is too late.

If doomsday ever comes (and I think it will) then you'll be glad you read this book. It is a great guide to what you need to do in order to survive should disaster occur and there is lots of great advice about the things that you could be doing now to ensure the future survival of you and your family. Will you need it? I hope not but its still worth knowing about.",5.0

There is no doubt in my mind that if doomsday ever comes then you'll be glad you read this book.  It is perfect as a guide to what you need to do in order to survive should disaster occur and there is plenty of advice about the things that you could be doing now to ensure the future survival of yourself and your family.

Will you need it?  I hope not but it's certainly worth knowing about.",5.0

The last few years have taught us all that there can be doomsday disasters, be they natural or caused by humans. This books gives you some great ideas on how to prepare and what you will need. You'll be surprised at how many things you agree with, but realize that almost no one implements it. Take a read and see for yourself.",5.0
"I found this book to be well worth the time I invested to read it.  In a world of economic uncertainity I personally have been looking for ways to be better prepared for any type of emergency.  This book was well written with an abundance of practical ideas to be better prepared for any type of man made or natural disaster.

After reading the book I have a list of things I can do starting tomorrow to get prepared.  I especially appreciated the suggestions on storing water.  Anyone regardless of your financial status can implement a water storage progarm.  The scary thing for me is I don't personally know many people who have taken the effort to have a supply of water on hand.

Overall this is a excellent book that I would have no problem recommending to my friends.  I don't usually comment on books that I read.  I felt the need however on this book because it will benefit so many people in the event of an emergency.",5.0
"I can relate with some of the situations mentioned in this book. Our place is frequented by typhoons. The roads get easily flooded and most of the time, electrical power is down. One alarming problem during such situation is the scarce supply of food and clean water. We rely on water delivery system and the nearby public market for food to eat. But when roadways are flooded, we are really helpless.

I like all the preparations related with food and water as they kind of give me ideas on how to deal with difficult situations we usually encounter during periods of strong typhoon. Those survival tips and ideas when the power goes out are practically helpful. The ideas of storing items during power outage kinda resonates with me. I have plenty of second hand books and they are really quick fix to boredom when the electrical power is down. Got some good ideas also on other ways to keep the light on during blackouts.",5.0

good for beginners and some more info for nonbeginners,5.0
If you are looking for a place to start or wanting an evaluation of where you are this book should be in your library.,5.0
"I really liked this book! The author has laid out the information in a very clear and simple manner. I have not read many books on this topic but I was able to easily comprehend the various concepts discussed.

I really appreciated the economic approach to the book.  If you are like me there are some things you would like to do in your life but don't end up doing because of lack of money.  This book is written for those who want to be better prepared but are also tied to a budget.

I found that the essential prepping procedures were effectively outlined in case of world turmoil or natural disaster. It seems like everytime I turn on the news there is some kind of world striff occuring.  In my opinion this book was helpful and worth reading!",5.0
"This book is absolutely perfect for new preppers.  As a matter of fact, I think there's a lot of good information in it for experienced preppers too.  I have to admit that you can't beat the price either.  At only $2.99 I think it's a great value and I'm glad that I read it!",5.0
This book is full of a lot of helpful information about how to get started preparing for emergencies.  It also has lots of tips about how you can save money while you are storing emergency preparedness supplies.,5.0
"Very Basic info, but it is a great read to get started preparing for any type of emergency or disaster!",5.0
I bought this book for my fianc and he loves it. There are a lot of great ideas that are budget friendly. Happy prepping!,5.0
Very detailed in every aspect of survival recommend this book to all preppers I myself love this book.  And hope more people read it,5.0
One of the best prepping and survival books I have ever read.  Helped me a lot when I practice getting prepared.,5.0
This book has a lot of great points on prepping. There are some great topic to make you evaluate your budget. Good section on bug out bags.,5.0
Thorough little hand book for those who just have that feeling that something bad WILL HAPPEN.  Lot's of good info and clearly laid out in easy to follow steps.  Lot's of good references as well.  Good book for the paranoid.,5.0
I like to look at these prepping books.  The price was right.  I skim read it every now and then.,5.0
"An interesting read for me with some new advice for preppers.

I liked the advice about purchasing one extra while shopping so that one's budget doesn't get overpowered.  I had also never thought about a two way radio for communication.  And, last but not least, items are listed that would have a high value when used for bartering.

The author has also provided a list of websites that are helpful for an added bonus.

Most highly recommended.",5.0
great book for all preppers to have because you never know when or where something is going to happen in these times.,5.0
For someone just embarking on preparedness this book is helpful. It's an easy read. Even for someone already well into prepping it contains useful info. Good read. Recommend to anyone interested in becoming more prepared for emergencies.,5.0
This is a great book for newbies and it helps to remind you to do what you can as you can do it and not get overwhelmed by everything.  If you haven't read this yet get started!,5.0
Lots of great information! Well worth the money! I learned a lot of good stuff that I didn't know before!,5.0
Lots of good practical advice for beginners. Divided into short one page chapters. Applies to any type emergency. Well written.,5.0
Great value with lots of useful information. It takes a lot of the worry out of how to begin making preparations.,5.0
The product came as described and was delivered as stated.  Great seller and a smooth transaction.  Quality product on all levels.,5.0
"All of the information contained in this book I was already aware of so I personally didn't take much away from it. That being said, I think that the author hits all the major points that any prepper needs to have covered. If you are new to prepping this one is a must read !!!!!",5.0
"I got Patty's other great book `Build The Ideal Bug Out Bag' after seeing all the ads for the Doomsday show on National Geographic, which doesn't come out here until next week. I was glad to see that Patty had written a more general book on prepping. One that is full of solid advice from buying your supplies by couponing, to how to handling your pets in an emergency. Highly recommended reading.",5.0
"I must say that I haven't been too much into prepping before, but lately, all these things happening around us got me thinking. This is actually the first book I picked-up on the topic. And I must say that from the first page, I got hooked.

Patty shares a ton of tips, that are not only extremely useful, but very entertaining to read. You will not have to break the bank, because it's mostly about what you need to do and how to do it effectively. Lots and lots of tips and tricks that will get you prepared to face any emergency situation. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Very interesting and necessary book, I should say. I am not a fan of doomsday books or anything related to the ""run for your life"" reading, but this one actually caught my attention. The writer really has laid it out in a clear, simple and full scale manner. She described all the necessary prepping procedures in case of any possible destructive nature acts, war or social unrest.
As I have experienced a little bit of doomsday happening in my country, I know very well how vital are your survival skills and knowledge in such kind of shakedowns. When it happens, you will not have time to read books on survival, that's why I recommend reading it even if your country or town is doing fine at the moment. It takes one powerful electromagnetic pulse from the Sun to wipe out electricity not only in one town, but possibly the whole nation or nations. After that the ones with the knowledge will have a HUGE advantage over those who were ""singing in the rain"".",5.0
"Things I like about it:
The back pocket is sturdy and easily keeps 20+ pages without tearing at the edges.
There are three holes across the top - not just one.  This is really helpful when the weight of the back pocket gets quite heavy.
Joanne, the calendar designer, did an excellent job of optimizing space.  Each daily block is 2 1/8 x 3 3/8 inches and had nine lines to write on.
The stickers are quite colorful.  The big ones are 9/16ths square.  The star stickers are 11/32nds of an inch and come in seven colors.  The smaller stickers fit perfectly on each line of the calendar without interfering with the other lines.

Things I wish were different:
I wish every page was full color.  The photos on some pages are largely black and white.  You children could color them in but mine do not and it makes for a blah month.
I would like to see stickers that are more relevant to my life.  Each year several stickers (i.e. road trip and hot lunch) go unused. Stickers I would like to see are the holidays (It would be nice to add a pop of color to the holidays we celebrate.), car registration/inspection due, pay bills, and check smoke detectors.
The back pocket has advertising on it.  The More Time Moms Family Meals and app are advertised here. I would pay a bit extra to have these things advertised on the back cover rather than having to look at it every time I access the pocket.

Other things you might like to know:
The moon phases, 2 - 4 spots to write lists, a quote, the previous and the following month are included on each page.
The middle of the calendar is held together by a plastic coil.
There is a small January 2016 calendar on the inside of the back cover.  This is helpful for future planning.",5.0
"I am a very busy Mom, of two boys, soccer/ cub scouts and working full time.  I tell my husband the calendar is the ""Bible"", if its on there it is for real.  Love the big squares to right in. Sticker are cute too.  I like the pocket in the very back.
Enjoy.",5.0
"This is the world's best calendar!!!  I have been using this brand for the last seven years and wouldn't use anything else.  I refer to it as  ""my brains"" and that is not an exaggeration.  I would be completely lost without it.  It keeps our family of eight informed and prepared for what is coming next.  It has big blocks for each day and looks nice hanging on the wall in the kitchen.  There is enough space in each block that I am usually able to jot down any notes of interest about the day along with scheduled items.  It has often served as a journal where we could look back at the previous years to check and confirm dates, places and happenings.  I would highly recommend this calendar.  It is also a good deal for the cost.  I just ordered my calendar for next year and it is already hanging on the nail behind our current year's calendar.  As appointments and events come up for next year I am able to write them in so that we don't forget.  This is one of the most valuable items in our home!!",5.0
"I have purchased the same calendar for years - and I LOVE it!!  It has plenty of room to write, great stickers, can easily hang on the refrigerator or in a cupboard, has a pocket for storing things in the back, and comes out early - so you can get started on your next year's appointments and planning - and have somewhere to write it!",5.0
Love this calendar!  Have been ordering it for years.  Fast delivery!,5.0
"Just the right size!  Will use just a small portion of attached stickers. (no kids here)
Con: Maybe make ""stickers"" for the ""Retired ppl"" that buy this calendar?  ;o)  I'll be going to staples or the $ store for stickers.
We live on the beach now, and needed a calendar reminder for when land-locked guests are coming for a mini beachy vaca. here.
We can sleep 5 plus air-beds....so we need to know when to say no.  LOL",5.0

We use the bottom line to write in the daily meal plan too! :)",5.0

Good calendars are a must for a busy family. This one is great!,5.0
This calendar is the best calendar out there!,5.0
"I've been using the More Time Moms Calendars for at least ten years now and love them.  They fold up so they can take up so we can take them somewhere with us if we want to do planning while traveling. In addition, I have 8 children and so a calendar with many lines is not just nice but absolutely necessary! The stickers are a nice bonus, too.  I will continue ordering these for as long as they keep printing them, I'm sure.",5.0
"I love the large spaces for each day, a must with a busy family. The kids love putting the stickers on and the pocket is so useful.  A must for a busy family!",5.0
I have used this calendar for years and will never use any other until all kids have moved away. This calendar is our activity bible. The size is FANTASTIC when you need to squeeze in more than one family members activities.,5.0
Our annual family calendar!,5.0
"I love this calendar -- the calendar opens up so that you have lots of space to write (even has lines in each square.  Don't make the mistake I made when I ordered a different calendar the sheets come off, the squares are small -- what a waste of money and I think they advertise in such away that it's easy to order by mistake.  this is my 4th MTM (the other is called MotherWord and looks smilar). Don't be deceived!",5.0
"This is the only calendar I will ever use! With four active boys, there is plenty of room to record play dates, school activities, and sports, along with doctor appointments and the occasional date night!  Love the little stickers it comes with as well!",5.0
This calendar is perfect for my needs. It's big enough for organizing everyone's daily schedules and the colorful stickers help. I've tried other ones but always come back to this one.,5.0
I have had one of these calendars every years for about the last 10 years. I LOVE them!,5.0
"Love this calendar. The daily squares are large enough to write at least 10 activities in each. The squares are lined, which helps keep the writing neat. The numbers are large and clear enough to be read across the room. The handy pocket in the back is great place to store an invitation, or other paper that may pertain to a future activity. Loved that some pages are in color, and some are only line drawings. There are many small stickers that are also included. Glad that I found this very useful calendar.",5.0
I absolutely cannot live without this calender!! I have a huge family and I can write everything on it. I have been buying it for several years now.,5.0
I have been buying More Time Moms calendars for the past few years---this calendar is nice and large so I can fit all the activities of the day in each square :),5.0

I buy one of these EVERY year!  Lots of room to write things.,5.0
Love these calendars. Buy one every year. Plenty of room to write on each day with great stickers.,5.0
This is the only calendar I get every year. It has big squares to write everyone's schedule on and stickers for at-a-glance reminders. I keep them for a family journal for scrapbooking. They also come in handy for vacation planning and when blended family children visit their non-custodial parents.,5.0
I have been buying this calendar for 17 years now and I just love it. Plenty of room for appointment and notes plus all the nifty stickers to apply to special dates or dates that need reminder. Great calendar.,5.0
I buy one of these every year.  Love the large boxes.  Love the stickers.,5.0
Daughter-in-Law loved this.,5.0
My favorite calendar - I've been using it for about ten years to keep track of our family's activities.  I especially like the size of the daily boxes and that there are lines to help you neatly write in all the events of the day.  I also enjoy the variety of stickers.  I use them to make it easy to ID the reoccurring events and to make special events stand out.,5.0
"I have been getting this calendar every year since it came out.  It is a need and not just a want...as it helps me manage my crazy life...kids, house, pets...you name it!  Love love love this calendar!",5.0

The best calendar for adding multiple activities.  The boxes are very large and lined.  With 3 kids this is the ONLY calendar I purchase every year.,5.0
The BEST Mom calendar around,5.0
"I have been using this calendar for years.  I love it!  There is enough space to write all of our activities and the specialty stickers add some fun.  I also like that there are extra lines on the monthly pages - this allows me to add reminders for things that need to happen, but aren't specific to a day.",5.0
We get this every year. Works well for our family.,5.0
I use this calendar every ear.  I love it.  Well worth the money!,5.0

"My favorite calendar! I buy it every year. Lots of room to keep track of events for 5 family members, and the kids love the stickers! It's the only calendar for a family.",5.0
"I have been using this calendar for several years now.  It is a great calendar for recording all family events. Plenty of space for recording multiple events each day. For us, the stickers are not really necessary, but perhaps more appropriate for families with younger children.  I highly recommend it!",5.0
"I've used this calendar for years. The day boxes are big enough to keep track of everyone in the family. I love that the paper isn't slick, so I can use pencil and erase as much as I need to.",5.0
Have been purchasing this calendar for years. Love the large lined writing space for each days doings.,5.0
Love this calendar!,5.0
"Love this calendar.  I have three children, all in travel sports and on multiple teams.  The boxes are nice and big so that you can clearly write what you need to do on that particular day and still have room to list birthdays and important events.  I live by this calendar!!! :)",5.0
"Love, love this calendar!! I've been buying them now for 6 years. I love how there's enough room to write more than one activity, per day. Definitely recommend for us busy mamas!",5.0
HUGE squares for each day. Awesome.,5.0
"This has been my favorite calendar for about 5 years now. I love the fact that the paper is not glossy and it is easy to write on. I also appreciate the large, lined writing area for each day. There is always enough room to list the activities for our family of 5.",5.0
3rd. year using it.  Large grid is the perfect size for a super busy schedule.  I like the small pocket available in the back.,5.0
I've used this calendar for many years.  It's perfect for my family size.,5.0
I've used these calendars for years and love how big they are and have so much room to write on them!  They keep me organized!,5.0
LOVE this calendar. I have had one every year for at least the last 8 years. It is bigger than most calendars and I like that it is lined so that it stay neat when multiple events are on a day.,5.0
Been using this calendar for years now & just love it!  Best one out there!!,5.0
"All of our family scheduled events are posted here.  A quick glance of the month tells you what is going on and where you have to be for the week.  I save last year calendars for reference as to when we did what.  Love the stickers.
Have purchased 6 years in a row.",5.0
Love this calendar!  Been using it for years!,5.0
"I've been buying this calendar for years. Big squares, plenty of stickers, large pocket in the back. Just add a multi-colored pen set and you can use this for a large family.",5.0
"Love these calendars/planners.  I return every year for the More Time Moms version.  purchased a few years ago from Costco and they have not provided it since then.  I now get it every year from Amazon.  Keeps my busy family organized and on time for all the many events, mostly sports, that are going on daily!  The stickers provided help keep me on time for birthdays and all other occasions as well.  The size is perfect for being able to write in all the schedules that our family of 4 have.  It's a good price through Amazon as well.",5.0
I've used this calendar for my family for 5 years now.  I would never buy a different one.  I LOVE this calendar--so much space to write things down.,5.0
"I have used this calendar every year since I first heard of it, likely 10 years ago.  The squares are big enough to write multiple items legibly, and the 16-month aspect means I have flexibility in when I transfer things over to the new calendar.  Just right.",5.0
I love the calendar.  I buy them every year.  It has handy stickers and a good amount of space to write.,5.0
"I have used this calendar since 2009.  I used to be able to purchase it at our local Border's, until they closed.  Now I order it as soon as possible from Amazon to assure that I get my copy.  I would be lost without it.  My only 'whine' is that they now put a lot more color in the calendar.  It used to be that all of the illustrations were uncolored and I enjoyed coloring them with colored pencils as I spoke on the phone. The large boxes, the stickers, and the pocket are a few of the things that draw you to the calendar, but I also love that it is sturdy and well constructed.  I keep my calendars as a sort of 'diary', and the fact that it looks as good on the last day as it does when I receive it is wonderful.",5.0
"I have been using this calendar for years, ever since I discovered it on the shelf at Borders (I now order it from Amazon).  My family runs by the ""If it isn't on the Calendar It doesn't exist"" rule.  Lots of room to write in each box for appointments, reminders, celebrations, etc.  About every other month is a color pic, but that is not a problem as my daughter loves to color in the months not color printed and it makes the calendar even better.  I think, I would actually be sad if they had full color and I couldn't have her ""fix"" it for me as she has been doing this for years!",5.0
Best calendar for a busy life,5.0
Love this calendar! Have bought it every year since atleast 2006.,5.0
Great tool for working on children's balance and coordination.,5.0
My 3 year old niece loves this. It's great and we have all played with!!,5.0
"All 3 of my boys use this in our basement.  It works well on carpet and hard wood.  It is OK on ceramic tile.  I was afraid it would scratch the hardwood, but it has not.  My oldest is almost 200 pounds, and he is still able to move it around.",5.0
The children love it.  It was a gift for my 2 of my grandsons ages 4 and 6.  My daughter-in-law has since purchased more for their friends birthdays.,5.0
"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter to help her develop a better sense of balance. She loves to stand on it while playing wii games. I feel less guilty when she's getting screen time, b/c her balance is improving and she's getting a core workout as well. I'm not much of a skater, so I didn't get much out of this item on dry land. However, this thing is awesome on the snow. The poor-man's snowboard. I suggest getting the larger version as it will come in handy on the slopes.",5.0
Granddaughter went crazy over it.,5.0
"Kids love these, great purchase!",5.0
I purchased this for my 2 year old son as a Christmas gift. He LOVES it! The quality is great and it's easy to use. My son plays on it often. It's held up great with three kids using it!,5.0
This was a birthday gift for my nephew. I'm probably going to have to get more of them for his brothers now. :),5.0
"kids and friends (boys and girls) from 4 years to 13 years love these!!!!
I don't mind them doing tricks in the house and it keeps their bodies moving.
I didn't realize you can do so many tricks... they are a bit pricy so I was hesitant. but worth every dollar! great idea and very pleased",5.0
9 yr old Granddaughter loved it!,5.0
Our nephew loved the spooner board. No idea if he has broken any bones yet though :),5.0
Got these for our five grandchildren ages 6 to 10. The boards are a good size for the kids. They provide a nice activity for the kids inside during the winter months. Boards are very sturdy. The kids are learning new tricks all the time. Haven't tried them as sleds yet.,5.0
Got this for my 5 year old son...he loves it! I've tried it a few times as well and it's a lot of fun! Definitely recommend it!!,5.0
Very fun! Our kids love them already.,5.0
"This is a very cool board. I bought it for my six year old daughter. So far she has done little more than spin on it, but she loves to play on it. It's great for keeping her active and burning off some extra energy when she's stuck in the house. It's also quite strong. I've stood on it (200 lbs) with just a little deflection.",5.0
"I got this for my three year old last Christmas and he is still playing with it almost a year later. Right now he loves to spin, but it's a nice toy that once he keeps practicing and getting the hang of it he can do more advanced tricks as he gets older. It has lots of fun uses, inside and out. Spooner has great promo videos showcasing the types of tricks it can do so. I didn't show my 3 year old the videos last year and not even know but I can introduce the more age appropriate ideas as he gets bigger.",5.0
grandkids love it,5.0
Grandkids can't wait to play with the Spooner when they visit.  This size better for kids up to about 6-7.  Go up to next size after that.  Great toy and teaches a lot of physics and balance.....even though the kids won't know they're learning because it's so much fun.,5.0
Kids love it,5.0
Lots of fun for all ages. All my kid's friends play on this when they come over. It's a big hit.,5.0
Everyone loves them!,5.0
I bought 4 of them.  The boards were a great success.,5.0
Gave it to my 8 year old niece and she loves it.  Mom wasn't keen on it being used on hardwood floor but it didn't leave any marks. Its better suited for asphalt playgrounds or concrete driveways. I think this will catch on and be a lot safer than razor bikes and skateboards.,5.0
4 year old grandsons love this.  Very sturdy and they jump right on & go!,5.0
My son loves it!!!,5.0
"Our Grandsons, seven and nine seemed very pleased with these boards. I liked that they can use them indoors and out, and they will be able to improve balance and coordination.with these.",5.0
"Great for balancing, and fun to play on. Can be used in all kinds of situations. Snow, Ice, Carpet, tile, gravel, grass, just an all around fun toy.",5.0
"Serious fun in our house! My four year old and eleven year old like playing with this thing equally. I tried it out and was sure I'd break my neck so I only spent a little time on it. They like to sit and spin, stand and ""walk"" with it and when it's upside down, my bigger kid can flip it with his feet and land on it like a skateboard trick. The only problem was that I only purchased one - so we have to take timed turns with it!",5.0
Very popular with a very active 4yo boy.,5.0
"It has at least 20 uses.  A skateboard, a snowboard, a shovel, etc...The kids love these and use them all the time.  Great for balance.  Great for playing outside.  The kids always find another way to use it.",5.0
"This thing is awesome. It's as fun as you make it. I bought it for my 6 year old son.  So far, we've used it on the carpet, wood floor, and snow.  It's a little tricky to be able to sit on it with all the big snow gear for sledding, but when he feels comfortable enough to stand or kneel on it, i'm sure that will be fun.",5.0
My kids love it!,5.0
My grandson loved it!,5.0
Perfect gift for granddaughter,5.0
Super happy with quality better than any other rope i have ordered and cheaper also.  Thanks for being there.,5.0
Great rope. Great quality. Unbeatable price.,5.0

"My wife purchased this for me to use with P90X.  She wanted to minimize the amount of space used to store workout equipment.  It is nice and small and fits behind the door.  I am only about 190 pounds so it holds me quite well and I never feel like I am going to fall.  The instructions were easy to follow and I had no issues during assembly.  Once all the bolts are tightened, it becomes quite sturdy.  The grips are comfortable and feel nice on my hands.  Overall I am quite pleased with the quality and use of the product.",5.0
"I ordered this product to use with p90x and am not disapointed. It assembeled very easy and is very stout. I'm 6' 1"" 220 lbs. and it has no problem supportting me. I would recomend this to anyone.",5.0
"I received this Heavy Duty Doorway Chin Up/Pull Up Bar as part of a set.  The bar was easy to put together and the addition of a link to an instructional video was awesome.  The various grips have a nice padding for your hands and are great for working the different muscle groups.  If you are concerned about it holding you don't be.  I am a 240 pound man and have never worried about it falling or ripping my door frame apart.  I think this product is a great tool to add to any workout arsenal - I use it for P90x and it is great! The other part that I must comment on is the customer service which is fantastic.  I called with a question and they actually treated me like I wasn't putting them out"" and helped me get the answer I needed.  I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to get in or stay in shape.

"I was using 'Iron Gym' regular edition  Prior to this one  but if you are seriously into Calisthenics - You need a WIDE GRIP Pull up bar
 It's well made, had no problems assembling it ; giving it 5 stars !

Update : have been using it for over a year , only one cushioning pad has recently fallen off , but considering my extensive use , I am still very satisfied with this bar,
and if it breaks in a few years I will definitely purchase another one",5.0
"This is a review of Black Mountain's Customer service.  While I purchase this item and received it unfortunately I discovered that my walls were too thick to accommodate this.  My natural instinct as an Amazon customer was to go through them entirely for returning it but felt as this was likely a smaller company I should try contacting the manufacturer first and see if I couldn't order a part that might fix it.  Rich was very helpful in assisting me and reassured me that while unfortunately their products could not solve my issue, I could very easily use a competitors product to get the results I needed, going so far as to recommend the brand, Perfect, that would solve my problem.  Very friendly reps and very sorry that I could not use this product of theirs.",5.0

"I ordered this pull up bar for P90X and it works great. It puts together very easy, feels very solid steel construction, and is very sturdy when in a door. Shipping was fast and tracking was on time. It does what it needs to do and I would recommend this product to anyone.",5.0
"This was super easy to assemble. I was doing pull-ups within 20 min. of opening the box! It fits right in my door way and goes up and comes does literally in seconds. I like the grip options and the construction seems solid. Of course I only weigh 125lb dripping wet.
I would highly recommend this product!",5.0
"I bought this item 2/15/2012 and it arrived 2/21/2012 as estimated. The package arrived around 5pm and i had it assembled within an hour and a half going at an easy going pace. I felt compelled to write this review because of several negative reviews that I read. On comments of the screws stripping; I noticed this too, but all I had to do was use the phillips to stabilize the screw and the wrench to twist the nut. No big deal. Everything is on tight and its all good. I'm no engineer, but let me serve example that if you have any comprehensive knowledge whatsoever and a use for a solid home pull-up bar, then I cannot recommend this product highly enough",5.0
"I started the P90X program by using resistance bands but after a bit, felt I needed to really go the true Pull Up route instead.  After looking around Amazon, it made the most sense for me to go with the BMP bar.  I had previously purchased the BMP resistance bands and I'm happy with those so far.  Well, the package arrive (yay Prime) and I quickly assembled it.  Make certain that you tighten the locking nuts really well.  I didn't use the optional but included black ""L"" brackets and placed it right on the door frame to see how it felt.  It feels very solid and is in no way going to hurt the door, moulding, or surrounding wall.  I'm using a fire door from my laundry room to my garage.  The nice thing is that my garage steps down 6-8 inches so as I place the bar facing the garage, I get that additional height to work with.  Goes up and comes down in < 10 seconds.",5.0
"After purchasing Iron Man Pull up Bar I realized that didn't cut it for me. Later on progressing on my work out schedule I needed something more professional grade. Black Mountain has created a beast. This Bar is not just a regular bar, but it is very well constructed and mounts very easily on the door.

I highly recommend this bar to anyone who needs a good grade Pull Up Bar.
It may cost a little more but definitely is the best bang for the buck.",5.0
My pull-up  bar arrived quickly and on time. It works great and was not difficult to assemble. I am very pleased. I also have BMP workout bands and had a question so I ended up speaking with one of the company's owners. The customer service level went well beyond my expectation! I would definitely  purchase more of their products when needed.,5.0
This pull up bar is one of the best I've ever used.  The handles are comfortable so my hands to not get calluses like they normally would on a plain metal bar.  It fits nicely in my doorway.  The size and structure is great. I am happy with the quality as a whole.,5.0
This pull up bar fits perfectly in my doorway.  I'm actually surprised by how well it works.  I thought for sure that it was going to destroy my door frame!  Already feeling the pain from a good workout.  I didn't know I was so weak!  Looking forward to using it more.,5.0
The lighter 4 pound resistance band is a perfect resistance for many of my clients.  I run a small fitness company and this may be the most popular band that my female clients use.  Customer service has been great with this company,5.0

"I've been looking for a pull up bar that works well, meets my needs, and matches my budget for a while.  And I'm happy that I stumbled on this new product from Black Mountain Products.  It's been working out just fine for me.  I don't have a gym membership because I can't afford it on a monthly basis so I like to workout from home.  A pull up bar is exactly what I need.",5.0
"I used to use the Iron Gym pull up bar, but decided to switch to something new that had more handle positions and so far I have not been disappointed with Black Mountain Products' pull up bar.  The design even feels slightly sturdier than the Iron Gym, as I was often afraid that that product was going to eventually snap in the middle.  I'm not sure what the issue is with the negative reviews for this product.  A pull up bar is a pull up bar.  It's pretty simple to set up and use.  This one is perfect.",5.0
"I read plenty of reviews on several different pull up bars, we needed one that would support my husbands weight of 230 pounds. The reviews stated over and over that this bar would hold the weight without bending. It works great, no movement, no bending, quality construction. We use it with the P90x.  Don't bother looking around this is the best one and at the best price.",5.0
"I started the P90X and wanted a comparable chin-up bar for less--this is exactly what I was looking for.
Just like P90X bar with multiple grips, plus the main center bar is one solid piece (this was an important factor when distinguishing between some of the other look-alikes).
The price is great. Arrived earlier than promised, easy to assemble(instruction sheet was easy to follow, I didn't even need my husband's help), great all around product.
The quality seems great too...me, my husband, and my oldest son have all used it. My Husband's max weight is 180 lbs., so we haven't really tested the weight limit, but it's great for us.
Fits my 32"" door perfectly.
Definitely a good value, especially when you factor in free super-saver shipping.
Bottom line is...I recommend it.",5.0
"This is a great product!  It shipped very fast (within 4 days I received the product).  I do a couple pullups whenever I walk past the equipment.

As long as you have a wrench and screwdriver this thing is very easy to assemble.  It also comes with brackets if you needed additional support on a specific door frame.  I rotate my workout around the house, so I haven't installed the brackets yet.  But make sure everything is strong and tight.  I originally used a battery drill, but had to hand tighten to get it correct.

The directions are helpful, especially on the easiest way to assemble.

I am approx 200 pounds and this product hasn't let me down (or fall down).  It is heavy duty and made from a good product.

I also purchased the resistance bands and they work very well with this product (for P90X or regular day-to-day workouts.",5.0
"This pull up bar is exactly what I was looking for. The difference between this one and many of the other ones here is that this pull up bar has a single member that spans the door opening. It is not two pieces joined together. It is not 3 pieces (I read on one review that the pull up bar assembly required putting 3 pieces together that span the doorway!). It is one solid piece that the other pieces build off of. I looked through many other pull up bars to find one that had this exact feature, because this is what makes or breaks the design.",5.0

I'm very satisfied with Black Mountain's resistance bands.

"Bought this Feb, 2013 thinking to use it when weights not available.  Used it a few mos. Lost interest.  After my accident (fell off the roof) in Nov, 2015, I had PT for months and the therapist had me use resistance bands. He told me to do certain exercises basically forever using bands.  Dug out my band that I bought, been using it for over a year, every day, I check it over prior to using because I considered that if it snapped on me because it was old and laying in a drawer for over a year.  I don't want to re-injure myself.  So far, it works like brand new.  Very well constructed. No fraying. No small tears. It supposedly has a lifetime guarantee, but I am realistic.  I think the company made a great product. I'll update this review if and when it breaks. Until then, nothing but good to say about it.",5.0
"the best,great workout",5.0
"These are good bands, they don't have smell and are very convenient to use since the handles are already fixed.",5.0

"Great product for someone who is just starting resistance training. I don't have time to go to an actual gym, and this is perfect for use at home.

"I was looking for a new resistance band because my previous one broke. Many bands I have used tend to break away from the hand grips over time. I ordered this one because it was eligible as an add-on via Amazon prime, but it had good reviews so I decided to try it. I am very happy with the purchase. I have been using this band for almost a year, and it is still holding up. The foam hand grips are comfortable and the band itself is still securely attached to each handle. I have not had any problems with the fabric handles fraying. It is nice to use as an option when traveling. I am considering purchasing a higher resistance level, since I currently have the green, which is about 10-12 pounds resistance.",5.0
Met my expectations. Good quality ,5.0
My husband and I are loving this resistance band!  I looked at many products and reviews before going with Black Mountain and I made the right choice!  The quality is excellent.

Check out their Dip Bar as well! Awesome home equipment there to balance out the gains if you already own a pullup bar!",5.0
"Very good resistance band, feels strong and durable. The anchor is a plus for doing extra work outs. The four starts is because there is no ankle strap for this resistance band, I think you should consider some adjustments for an ankle strap to get the best out of this band. But besides that its a good buy and a great price.",5.0

"I have been using Black Mountain (BM) resistance band for almost 2 months now.  My initial  experience with the band was not that great.  Here is why! I was out of shape, my arms were weak and so was my core.

Many exercises that involved using the resistance band (such as standing abdominal twists, pulls through, squats...) I could not do.  But I kept at it and I am getting better at it.  I do use the band 2 to 3 times a week.

What I like about the band:
1. Band came with door anchor so you can do many different exercise by just hanging your band over the door. Up to 18 exercises
2. The band came with a brochure containing tips/tricks on how to effectively use the band and get the most out of it.
3. Great quality
4. Using the band is another great way to strengthen your body. I don't like to do weight lifting and so the band works for me.

Any disappointment with BM band...Not really!

However, I did not get the color I wanted. I ordered orange and yellow was shipped instead. This is not a big deal, though.

When I first got the product, it took a minute to figure out how to get the bands into the handles as no instructions were provided for this (pinch the band and slide it into the handle).

So far, the bands have held up and I have yet to notice any tearing.",5.0
I searched for a while to pick perfect bands which hive you the best workout with heaviest resistance reading review after review. I settled on this company because of the different variety of bands plus the ease of switching bands to get different weights. As I do P90x I can switch bands quickly and not lose too much time from time from my workout. Highly recommended for a great P90X workout.,5.0
"I purchased two Black Mountian resistance bands sets. I like the soft handles and their flexability because they allow me to combine anywhere from 1 to all 5 bands for max. resistance. I would like to recommend that the loop on the door anchor to be made just a little larger so that one can slide the handles thru it while the bands are still attached. The bands  and handles appear to be of good quality, well made and will hold up if used properly.  I'am more than satisied with my purchase.",5.0
"I was very impressed with this set. Most of the resistance bands in the campus gym are fixed to a specific handle - you can't compound them to increase the resistance. With these bands, though, it's easy to create precisely the correct amount of resistance by mixing combinations from just a few bands. The handles are also surprisingly comfortable - more than I thought they'd be. The bands themselves also seem very durable and unlikely to age quickly.

The door anchor is sufficient for its purpose, though you do have to physically remove the handles from the bands in order to slide it on and off (of course, this is better than having the ""clipping mechanism"" some door anchors use, which almost invariably wear out and break). If you use the door anchor for pull-downs, though, you're probably using a lot more weight than you would for other exercises, so switching in and out of ""door mode"" usually requires removing the handles to change the bands anyway. Still, if the loop in the anchor were wide enough to pull the handle through, the issue would be averted entirely.

I don't usually use bands over weights, but I wanted to try them mostly as a travel-friendly alternative. They certainly fit that purpose well, especially with the bag which they give you. All together, they don't take up much room in a suitcase, and even then it's unlikely that you'd need to take all five bands with you anyway.

There was one small issue, however. The blue band had a few small spots of green rubber fused to the side (almost like the raised edge of a plastic figure that was cast in a mold - a sort of continuation of the rubber that didn't fit the rest of the figure). When I mentioned this to customer service, they profusely apologized and promised to send a replacement immediately. I can't say I mind, though - the band works just fine, and you wouldn't have noticed unless you were looking for that one spot.",5.0
I needed a band to take with me on an extended vacation to keep up some physical therapy exercises.  This was perfect.  I especially like the attachment to place in the door- it really adds quite a few more exercises.  It seems sturdy and durable.,5.0

"I live in a rural part of southern Arizona, and for many years I always took a copy of this atlas with me while 4 wheeling around the wonderful mountains and deserts. I always recommended it to anyone who spent any time whatsoever traveling. I also have copies of DeLorme's atlases of every western state.

I wore out several copies, and was looking forward to using the latest, 2008 edition, with the wonderful shaded relief and enhanced graphics.

This is not just a disappointment. It is now a dangerous book.

The level of detail is magnificent; too bad it is just plain wrong. Important dirt roads that cross mountain ranges have vanished. New roads, straight as arrows, seem to plow through rugged wilderness areas that have never, and will never, see a road of any kind. The paved county road that connects my small town with the even smaller town 6 miles away has inexplicably vanished.

If you have an older edition, keep it! Preserve it, coat it with vinyl and keep it safe. Because you cannot trust the present edition.

I went out and bought the newest BenchMark maps version of Arizona, and it appears to be correct, and it will be my new guide to getting around. The other DeLorme atlases I own? I cannot trust them, but I have spent too much to merely throw them away. So maybe I'll use them in conjunction with Benchmark atlases. But I'll never be able to trust them alone.

What a shame!

I called up DeLorme, wondering if perhaps, because I live on the border with Mexico, maybe they were cooperating with Homeland Security to confuse immigrants. But they denied it, and said that the level of detail is consistent with other DeLorme atlases. Which means they are probably all equally worthless.

So, once again, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is dangerous to rely on a map that has gone through the computer blender.",1.0
"So far, having only used this atlas a few times, I have discovered 2 critical errors. While I felt that the map was detailed and the design well done, changes that have been made to roads even before this atlas was published and inaccuracies can be frustrating or even dangerous.

The first problem. This atlas has not been fully updated to reflect changes in roads, even road changes that were made before it was published! For instance, Castle Hot Springs is a place that is north of Lake Pleasant (p. 43 of the atlas). The road to get to it, Castle Hot Springs Road, is a 2-lane, paved road with wide shoulders on either side. If my memory serves me right, this road was there before the atlas was published. According to the DeLorme atlas the roads that go south from the springs and north to it don't even meet- by a margin of three miles! Moreover, the parts of that road they do show indicate that it is no more than a roughly-graded dirt road- not a paved hgihway. Check GoogleEarth if you want to see for yourself.

The second problem. The different ""lines"" that the DeLorme has used for the roads in this atlas are inconsistent in how they are used. For example, the ride between Prescott and Crown King is pretty rough- no guardrail (sheer drops 100+ feet), unimproved dirt roads, a 4WD vehicle required. Even with an experienced off-road driver, the ride is limited to 5 mph in places and averages only 15-20 mph. However, the atlas shows that the road improves around Goodwin into an improved dirt road. The same kind of line is used on the forest road north of Payson, AZ where you can often go over 40 mph safely. Needless to say, I'm writing this bad review because of that. The road after the place called ""Goodwin"" was worse in many places. At one pint, the road had an extremely steep, angled part which we barely made past in a 4WD Explorer. We saw compact cars doing 40 on the forest road near Payson.

To add a bit of insult, the same line is used outside of Crown King on the way back to I-17. We averaged 35-40 mph down that road.

Needless to say, this atlas needs to be updated. Despite the economy, development has changed roads in Arizona a lot since 2008. However, it appears with this atlas material errors were made in representing features that existed before 2008. If you buy this atlas, understand this fact and before you go anywhere you are completely certain is 100% safe, do your homework. Though, I'm sure there are more accurate atlases out there.",1.0

"I am rather bemused by this lame post hoc attempt by Matt Furey to put out a low quality book at textbook prices. It should be noted, first of all, that Mr. Furey has been publicly denounced, via the internet, in a hand written letter by MMA Guru Karl Gotch. He stated the following from scientificwrestling.com : ""Thanks for sending me that copy of the fat man Matt Furey's website. As you know I don't have a computer and I don't know how to use it, but as I can see he employs it for a con game to steal from some poor guys that love the sport."".... And later in this same letter Gotch also states, ""The man is a disgrace to wrestling and has no honor at all, he can walk under a snake's belly wearing a top hat."" Strong words indeed from a then 81 year old retired wrestling legend who Furey claimed was a teacher and mentor. Furthermore, Gotch says, ""I wrote you all this to show you that how can a fat slob like Furey, that doesn't know his elbow from his rear end, tell and show these poor boys that he charges an arm and a leg and a finger thrown in.""

 The book (Combat Conditioning: Functional Exercises For Fitness And Combat Sports) is as  expensive as a Franklin Library leatherbound heirloom book. The point being, that it is barely beyond Kinko's quality. The contents of this book are largley available on the internet and they are just the regurjitated methods of Gotch and Gable- certainly not a scholarly composition.  Matt Furey has been accused of shameless self promoting at a level scarcely imagined by some of the industry's brightest lights. I have now sold my copy on ebay.

There are, however, some positive qualities of Mr. Furey worth mentioning. He is a former NCAA Wrestling champ and he did train under Dan Gable at Iowa.  Also, Karl Gotch did teach him several legit techniques over a period of six months.

These credentials, unfortunately,  don't make up for his appalling marketing scheme which should be independently investigated by you the consumer. It is true that my writing is not based on irrefutable facts, however, as a Platonist who enjoys physical culture. I encourage like minded individuals to take the time to find the best possible supplement for the best possible results. Always maximize efficiency and economize.
There are various media formats currently available depicting exercises personally demonstrated and instructed by Gable and Gotch. I recommend those articles to you.

In closing, I will reference the now famous Karl Gotch letter reproduced from scientificwrstling.com: "" I hope that we can find a way to stop this misfit from fleecing those poor guys, thanks again for letting me know.

Yours,
Karl.""",1.0

"This toy/sled is the biggest piece of garbage! It has been hyped on U-tube and it's really not worth a crap for anything! To start with I'm a father of 2 active and sports oriented kids, a son who's 10 and a daughter who's 9. To get an idea of our outside activities we ski, snowboard and go sledding every year and both children play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago. This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best). All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck! The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap. As a final note what a piece of garbage this thing is: Since Christmas when my kids and their friends got these they have been sitting in a pile outside my garage and have not been touched once, the kids have absolutely no interest in these.",1.0
I am rating this product with a one star as the unit broke when I was using it and caused me several injuries. There is a rubber pad that is supposed to grip the wall and for some reason mine fell apart. I am 190lbs so I meet the weight requirements to use this product. I'd like someone from the company or amazon to refund me or send me a new item. I enjoyed it a lot when it was operable and this review is based on injuries and the product breaking.,1.0

"I bought this when it was on sale during Amazon's pre-holiday lightning round, as I needed to replace an original Iron Gym pull-up bar that was falling apart after many years of use.  Even at the sale price, it turned out to be a waste of money!

First, the bar ends that rest against the door frame are hard plastic, not foam pads like on the Iron Gym.  The hard plastic ends will almost certainly damage a wooden frame. Heck, even the Iron Gym's foam pads eventually wore through the frame's paint, so I have no doubt that this model will do worse.

Second, the bolts that connect the top cross-bar are not recessed into the bar like they are on the Iron Gym.  In fact, on this model, the bolt heads stick out further than the rubber pad that is supposed to protect the wall!  These bolt heads will definitely leave marks on the wall above your door frame.

Third, the handles are straight, not angled as shown in the product picture.  This probably ticks me off more than the above problems, as I wanted the angled grip for wide pull-ups, and this was one of the reasons I chose this over another Iron Gym bar.

Fourth, this uses very thin bolts compared to the ones on the Iron Gym, and they are not plated like the Iron Gym's.  I bet these will rust quickly.

So, bottom line is this is an inferior design and doesn't come as advertised. It only cost me an Andrew Jackson so it's not worth sending back, but I recommend you shop around and compare the build quality before buying.  Note that most of the others that look the same probably are - look closely at the pictures and compare the bar ends that rest against the frame.  These obviously come from the same place, and are just rebranded with different names.",1.0

"I do not usually write reviews but my experience with this product was so aweful and frustrating that I felt obligated to share.

I was excited to use this pull up bar and was happy when it arrived.  Unfortunately my happiness turned to frustration moments after beginning to assemble the product.

1. There was not even close to enough of the nuts and bolts required.  I was forced to go to ace hardware to get all of the nuts and bolts that were missing.

2. After finally getting it put together I picked it up and the grips fell off.  I hadn't even used it yet and it was falling apart.

3. I do put it up in the door jam and test it out.  I try the inside bar and it works okay.  But there is a lot of creaking and stress noises from the bar(I'm 180 lbs)a little scary.. I test the outer grips and immediately after putting my weight on it the metal bent all the way downwards deforming the aweful contraption and making it impossible to use.

I built this exactly as it was supposed to be and it fell apart in one use.  Do not buy.",1.0
"I didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers had with regards to assembly.  The holes were all lined up fine and none of the nuts stripped out.  I even had a door frame that the bar fit well on too.

My main complaint is that this thing flexes and bends when I hang from it.  It claims it will support up to 300 lbs.  I weight 225 and if I use the outer handles, the entire front of the bar bends down a couple of inches or more.  I don't trust this thing to support my weight over the long haul of the P90X workout.  I friend of mine blew out his knee in college when the chin up bar he was using broke free.  I think the design is sound, they just need to have it manufactured somewhere where they aren't using cheap grade tubular steel.",1.0
"I am very disappointed. This was supposed to be a birthday present for my husband. Instead, this purchase will be going straight to the garage sale pile. We didn't know, until he assembled it, that it would not fit most of the door frames in our 8 year old home.  It started to put dents into our wood frames when he tested it out. The only ones it would fit properly were the ones to the outdoors, which makes it quite inconvenient. It also seemed to have too much ""give"" to it when he would allow it to bear his full weight. Since the product was assembed and tested, I didn't think I could return it.  Plus I'm too busy to bother with the hassel of insisting it was returned.  CHECK THE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR DOOR FRAMES, because despite what the description says, it DOES NOT FIT MOST DOOR FRAMES.",1.0
"The provided screws do not go all of the way into the provided wall anchors. The screws are too short! I am an engineer and it is clear to me that this design has not been fully considered. The purpose of a wall anchor is to have the screw enter the locking area of the anchor. I must now go to the hardware store and attempt to purchase the correct hardware to mount this piece of crap.

Also the direction are simply one picture and it is ambiguous as to the orientation of certain components. You can muddle through this but it is certainly very annoying.

Lastly, the instructions call for a 1/4"" drill bit for the wall anchor. This size drill bit is clearly too large for the wall anchors as they slide out very easily (even after the provided screws which are too short are inserted). I now have four ugly holes in my dry wall.

I strongly recommend going with a different pull up bar.",1.0

"I received this item and began the assembly.  It's fairly straight forward, no rocket science needed.  When I attempted to screw the nuts onto the machine screws that are provided, things started to go south.  These fasteners must have been manufactured somewhere in Borneo.

Reason: the anchor wedge is too small to adequately anchor in all door jambs.

"These are all based on a simple idea of using the elasticity of bands to provide resistance for a workout. They only needed to do one thing to improve this basic idea so that it could be safe to use at home. The resilience of the elastic bands. However, these are just off the shelf bands with no improvement. As a result, these bands easily rip and tear after a few months of use. The lifetime product warranty that they are talking about covers only the first 90 days of use because that's how they define the product lifetime in the fine print.

The black band broke not even two weeks after I had it. It didn't snap where bands usually do this one broke off right by the handle.

"I have been interested in doing some p90x for a long time now, and after seeing such a cheap set of resistance bands, decided to take the plunge. Right off the bat I was impressed with the speed in which I got the item. The only problem was it was jammed into a envelope (not even a cardboard box) that was way to small and my set of resistance bands was literally falling out in multiple places. This immediately raised red flags for me. After using the bands to start my exercise I must say there is little to no resistance in even the heaviest of band. Now I am no body builder, but if a weakling in desperate need of p90x find they offer little resistance, I imagine they would be near useless to someone in even decent physically condition. In fact, the heaviest band is so short, and yet so weak, that it snapped less than a week into use. I have since given up on this product. Buyer beware, the cheap price comes at the price of being cheaply made.",1.0

Please avoid the heavy set and only use the lightest bands. Do NOT use the 20+lb bands as they will snap quickly. Lighter bands will last a few months.  As others mentioned the manual says they are only designed for 90 days... well, the real ones are designed to last a lfetime.",1.0

"Not so sure how this has 4.6 stars. I focused on the good reviews when I purchased when I should've read all the bad ones. The band seem to be of good quality, but the issue is the threading that they use on the ankle strap, handles, door anchor, and the peice that connects the bands to the carabiners. They are all starting to come apart which can be dangerous considering all the metal parts that they use.

I bought these for physical therapy because I was in a car accident. I'm 105lbs, in a wheelchair, and only have 1 arm that I can use. This should prove that I couldn't possibly push these bands passed their breaking point. I used this product a total of 4 times and during one of my exercises I heard the threads ripping so I stopped to check. Good thing I did because taking a metal carabiner + rubberband to my broken leg or arm would have been extremely painful.",1.0

"I kinda feel bad for giving this company a bad review but after my experience, I feel it my civic duty to inform others. I had two black bands and one red (I'm super strong like that) and I was doing my FIRST, that's right my FIRST workout when the tip of the red one snapped!  See Exhibit A.

Thankfully, it just scared me (not little girl scared of a bug kinda scared, more like Navy SEAL about to get dropped deep behind enemy lines kinda scared), and I didn't get whipped and I didn't lose an eye.

My personal feeling after this experience is that resistance bands are inherently dangerous. I'll be moving on to TRX and/or gymnastic rings. Any injury from those will most likely be from my own stupidity.",1.0
Returned these because the bands were so tight they didn't allow for a full stretch and didn't like the fabric strap that had to be used to hook to the door.  Plus they charged close to $8 to return it.,1.0
The cuff broke the first time I used it. I don't have much faith that the other pieces won't break as well. Really dangerous.,1.0
Very poor quality.  I bought this for my father who is 65 years old.  He was using this product exactly how it was instructed.  The strap broke and the band snapped back at him with a lot of force.  Imagine a large band like this with a lot of tension smacking back at your head.  The stap broke within the first couple of days of use.  What if it snapped back and him in the eyes.  Very dangerous due to poor quality.  Do not buy this brand.  Q,1.0
"Purchased at the end of March, 3 of the 5 bands have completely torn. The first band tore in less than 3 months. The other two bands tore a few months after. Bands were used less than 3 times a week. Very disappointed",1.0
"Horrible! The part that goes between the door frame and door broke after the first 3 reps. It broke from the strap area that has the metal loop stocked to the Velcro part of the strap. The metal piece flew and hit me right on the front ribs. I feel pain but hopefully nothing is broken....it just happened a few mins ago. This is very dangerous, imagine if it would have taken out my eye or something! Don't buy this or any other resistance band that you would regret later on. I am throwing these in trash...im not even going to bother returning these....",1.0

Very disappointed that this lasted for such a short period, but just long enough to be past the return window.  Save yourself a welt and go with a different brand!",1.0
This product  is not safe for moderate to heavy use  unfortunately  I cannot return the bands because the rerurn date has expired. These bands are an accident waiting to happen,1.0
The second day of use and the Red band snapped while I was using it.  Its the only band I've used so far and now I'm a little scared to try using the others.  It snapped while doing leg work and smacked me across my face - good thing it hit my cheeks and didn't blind me!  If this is any indication of the quality of materials this company uses..... then I suggest buying from a different company.,1.0
"so i received my bands.  why does the instruction manual start out with these warnings:

1. ""do not use this product without safety glasses.  eye protection equipment should comply with ANSI Z87.1 standards.""  odd that no photos of the smiling people using this product, on this page or in the very same instruction manual, feature anyone wearing any kind of eye protection whatsoever, and this warning does not appear on the product page.

2.  ""resistance bands are intended for 90 days of use.  do not, under any circumstances, use resistance bands beyond 90 days""  news to me!  again, absolutely no mention of this on the product page (i wouldn't have bothered to buy them), and it kinda makes the whole 'lifetime warranty' thing you keep mentioning a bit silly.  does your warranty mean you are going to send me replacement bands every 90 days for life?

Only comes with one ankle strap when all similar products come with two...,1.0
"Don't waste your money. These are a total scam. The claim of a ""lifetime"" warranty is almost fraudulent. I don't think anyone would realistically expect these bands to last a lifetime but perhaps a few years. Nope. ""Lifetime"" apparently means the expected life span of the bands which is 90 days of usage. In fact, the instruction manual states that under no circumstances are you to use these band longer than 90 days. None of this is explained anywhere on any website selling the bands, including the maker's website, this is explained only in the instruction manual.

The disclaimer that these bands are only to be used for 90 days should be included in every website that sells these bands in bold print so that buyers can make an informed choice. I purchased these and have not even used them once I read the 90 day caveat. They are going back for a refund.

AVOID! (I'm sure this applies to all workout bands as well)",1.0
"This is a horrible and dangerous product. I have experienced two bands breaking and one caused a very painful welt in my arm.  I contacted the company for the first band that broke and they sent a replacement.  Today I decided to try the bands again today and a second band broke.

This products does not pass the test of time and by that I mean less than a year. My brothers and I use these bands just about every day and I guess you could say that we use them more than your average person. That being said all the bands have tears in them and one has completely ripped and one of the handles is broken. So if your actually going to be using them more daily they will eventually rip. I guess the saying is right you get what you pay for.,1.0

Mercifully I did not lose any teeth, break my nose, or lose an eye; but my face is hideously bruised.",1.0
The good news is that my order arrived in one day. Bad news is that the door anchor was not included. Trying to decide if I should return it since the door anchor is required for most of the exercises.  Can't find a contact link on order so it appears Amazon and Black Mountain don't want to hear anything bad. Be careful when ordering this product.,1.0
"The red band started fraying after 3 months of use. I did nothing out of the ordinary. Per the P90X workout, I would gently step on the bands about 4 inches from the handle to perform certain exercises. But the band started tearing in several places closer to the handles. Now I cannot use it because I am afraid it will snap.

I expected better durability but was disappointed.

Find another brand if you plan to use bands day-after-day for longer than 3 months.",1.0

"So I don't usually write negative reviews, but I have to for this one. I bought these to replace a Tower cable system which I used for 5 years and finally snapped. These don't even come close to it. The bands and clips feel flimsy. The door anchor is fine, but it feels like if you pull too hard it'll pull the whole door off the hinges. My two issues are the fact that really cannot do any exercise below the waist since there is no way to anchor at the bottom of the door, unless your door is hung poorly and is flush to the floor. The bands are also way too long. I'd recommend try another product, this one just doesn't cut the mustard.",1.0

Door anchor is poorly made.. It seems like the anchor itself broke into pieces as I was using it and slapped me right on my face! Luckily I wear glasses otherwise I'm sure I would've lost an eye! This is terrible and could lead to a lawsuit ! Anyways I just want to warn others to buy a separate anchor or buy from a different merchant,1.0
I used this product for just a month or so before three of the bands broke. I now have a welt on my back due to the last one. I highly recommend NOT purchasing these items as they are DANGEROUS. If that hit my eye I would be blind. I should have learned my lesson after the first two snaps.,1.0

When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.",1.0
"The cords tore after a year, and I'm not such a strong person. What can I say.... Careful, when they do it can be painful!
I'm not sure other products at same price point are better - if you gotta buy this brand, just change for a new one every few months.",1.0
"I got these to replace my Bodylastics (BL) which I purchased from Amazon in 2010.  The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see.
Overall: they work.  Good for light workout.
On Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.  The cloth door anchor does not mar and permits you to use the bands on trips.",1.0

"The set seemed sturdy and well-made, however the bands were too long for my body height to be of any real use and the door gadget didn't work very well.

After I was injured using this product a just a few minutes ago, I immediately went online to post this review. This is a dangerous product.

The door anchor with the red band attached worked for a few reps before sliding through and the anchor HIT me like a sling shot at maximum force. Use this at your own risk. DO NOT send me a replacement.",1.0
"Horrible! Made of what can only be described as cheap, substandard material, do not buy these if you plan to use them regularly.  My wife used these 1 to 2 times per week since we bought them in June 2014.  The green and blue straps broke after only 10 months of use.

The peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole. It comes out with even minor pressure applied. I thought I had a lemon until I read other reviews with this same issue. Stay away from this product until they fix this issue!! It's seriously not safe.",1.0
"Seem to just fine, sturdy, almost professional grade, nice colors, great bag....no complaints!",1.0

"I found 3 issues with the BMP bands.  1) The clips on the ends of the bands are just too small.  I kept pinching my fingers when removing or connecting the handles. The clips would sometimes stick open also.  I finally replaced the clips with larger ones that were made better.  2) The sides of the handles kept rubbing on my hand. I am small boned but do wear a size large glove (but not when using the bands).  Also, the rings on the handles are too small, making it difficult to attach multiple bands.  I finally replaced the handles with larger ones that also had bigger rings. 3) I tested the resistance of the bands and found that I could only get the rated resistance when the bands were doubled back and connected to the same point. On a single (end to end) arrangement the resistance measured 50 to 60% of the advertised resistance when stretched to a length of 10 feet (measured from the end of the clip to the end of the clip).  I realize all manufactures rate their bands differently so maybe BMP's tests are different than mine.  I just used a fish scale and observed the reading over a specific distance. Another manufacturer's bands measured closer to their advertised resistance however on the same end to end arrangement.  With the above modifications and knowledge of the actual resistance I am able to get the workout I want but I will not be purchasing anymore BMP products.",1.0
I keep snapping these. I've broken three of them in the last year. I wouldn't recommend them for anyone. I'll have to contact their warranty department.,1.0
"I bought these to use for the popular P90X program. They worked well enough for the first couple of weeks although I felt I wasn't getting as much as I could out of the workout using bands compared with free weights. After a couple of weeks, the red band started showing signs of tearing on both ends about an inch from where the band connects with the handle. It seemed to still hold up to stress so I didn't think much of it; however, later that week, one end snapped and whipped my back, leaving a huge red, stinging imprint in its wake lol. I wrote an email to Black Mountain's customer support address to see about using the ""Lifetime Warranty"" that's advertised to get a replacement band; it's been about a month since sending the email and I've yet to hear back from them. I went out and bought free weights to use instead and I'm MUCH happier! As suspected, I wasn't getting the most from my workout with the bands. Using the free weights provides a much more intense workout than I experienced with the bands and my muscles are actually sore the next day. If you're at all like me and contemplating using resistance bands over free weights, do yourself a favor...save yourself time and money and go with the free weights...I wish I did!",1.0
We could never get this to work worth a darn.  It was a waste of money and has sat in a closet after numerous attempts to make this work.,1.0

The company offers a 90 day LIMITED warranty. When I inquired about the warranty they told me that incidental damage isn't covered which means when they snap after normal usage BMP will NOT replace them. I'd say don't waste your money if you plan on working out with these for more than 90 days and even then the company still refuses to replace the red and black bands which both snapped at the exact same place (right next to the hand grip). Bought these for use with the p90x program and they snapped after less than 50 days of usage. Very dissatisfied.,1.0
"I brought these as an alternative to weight training for my female clients, and for myself when travelling. I was very disappointed when the red band pop it came right out of the hole, while doing a basic shoulder press they should consider better reinforcements to keep the bands lock in the hole. Will not recommend these to my fellow trainers.",1.0
"I loved the bands for about 2 weeks! My workout was much more portable.  I loved it, that is, until while doing bicep curls with the door anchor under my door frame, the bulky knob slipped out from under the door and I got hit in the face with 30 pounds worth of resistance band!  I was fortunate enough to not be seriously injured (I hope.. provided the blurry area in the vision of my right eye comes back to normal).  The bulky knob on the opposite side of the door has the capacity to compress!!! They didn't use a hard object, so it wore down over time, compressing more and more until it slipped under, resulting in a great deal of pain, and a black eye.  Word to BMP: FIX THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE!

As far as the bands go, they're great.  Sure.  But be careful about that anchor....",1.0

"In a split second my life changed because of this product.  I was a happy, healthy 64 year old lady just retired and looking forward to fun.  I thought I was safe.  A Certified Personal Trainer gave me the exercises and looked at this set of exercise cords.  One month later while performing one of the exercises the D-Ring came out of the handle and with full force -- slammed into my left eye!  The impact broke everything in my eye!  I couldn't see for over a week and when the blunt trauma finally cleared, the surgeon explained that in an instant the D-Ring caused severe traumatic glaucoma, cataract, broken iris, plus other injuries.  It is hard to convey to you how awful this injury has been but I am going to try because NO ONE should ever use bungee cords or exercise cords because of the danger.  Two surgeons told me that cords are quickly replacing BB gun injuries as the number one eye injury.  Instead of being healthy, I made 37 visits to the eye surgeon in 2012; had two extremely difficult and long surgeries to rebuild/repair what was damaged by this product.  Was using this product worth the potential strength benefit?  ABOLUTELY NOT!  Use weights!  I am blessed and fortunate -- I can still see.  I had 20/30 vision in my left eye...now it is like looking through frosted glass = blurry, halos around every light, and limited sight -- cannot read, cannot see most of what is on a PC screen and EXTREME Pain.  Today is the one year anniversary!  My injured eye is always uncomfortable because of the trabeculectomy surgery to rebuild the drain field so my sight would be saved.  I am truly blessed!  I had a surgeon who is gifted beyond belief and I am eternally thankful I can see.  Don't buy a product you cannot trust--these D-Rings are at best flimsy!",1.0

"The Red and black band broke, it happened to me after about 1 year and 50 - 60 days usage. The red band broke and slapped me in my face, the black band tore up with in a few days. My kids were not around and my glasses did not crack. The plastic grip crushed (few days ago). These bands are not comfortable. The grip is small and will become abrasive with your hands and arms as you do exercises. I use it mainly to do P90X. Don't buy this product, it will be a slap on your face.",1.0
"I wish I would have taken the warnings I read in some of the other reviews seriously!

I purchased these bands and loved them the first 2 times I used them. The handles make the bands very comfortable to hold. They seemed to be high quality. I am 5'3"" and the stretch was plenty for me, though if you are tall I'm not so sure this set of bands would work for you. After my first 2 uses I would have given these bands 5 out of 5 stars, but after today's workout there's no chance!

While I was using the yellow band the hardware snapped and hit my leg. Thankfully it hit our concrete garage floor before hitting my leg. I've attached photos of the hardware issue--  as you can see one of the handles becomes disconnected even with the slightest amount of pull. It seems that the peg that keeps the clip attached to the band is too small for the hole.

All in all I would say don't waste your money! I'm going to cough up a little more money and buy actual dumbbells.",1.0
I bought set of these bands in april which lasted 3 months. I don't work out regularly but black and red bands broke. I thought it might be my fault. I bought another set in august which again broke after using it only 5 times. Now I am left with two sets of yellow green and blue only. I am really disappointed with product. now I have to buy only red band for 10 $.,1.0
"I just received bands yesterday, and I was just testing out the feel of the green and black bands together and after 4 curls...the metal part of the green band popped out of the connecting socket and snapped into my foot.  Thanks to the poor quality of this product, I now have a giant welt on my foot. Just to let everyone know I am 5'11 and 160lb, by no means a BIG guy, and was not even close to pulling with full force. Perhaps I just received a lemon, but I'm demanding a refund. I would advise any potential buyers to be careful.",1.0

Bought the bands 3 months ago. Two sets of the band (the blue and the red) have already snapped. Not very durable at all.,1.0
"The ability to swap and change the bands in this set was what first attracted me to these bands and good reviews sold me.

My own experience hasn't been so great though ;(

After about three weeks in my first band snapped, and week by week another band bit the dust.

I'm not in any way a big guy and only used them for some fitness training, so have been very disappointed by their performance.

Glad others have had a better experience, but not for me.

"I have used these resistance bands sporadically, at best.  I generally only take these on vacation to help be consistent with my exercise routine.  Two have failed at the attachment end (to the handle).  The first was the heavy yellow and today the red.  If you have never broken an elastic exercise band, let me tell you; it hurts.  Even the small diameter bands can cause a great deal of pain.  Will try other manufacturer.",1.0
"I had only been exercising with these bands for two weeks when they began to break. Heartily disappointed. Even when they weren't breaking, the clip on nature of the handles made them painful with which to work when doing exercises like military press which requires the lanyard to drag across your skin. Spend a little more to get a durable set of bands that can actually be used for a workout.",1.0
Purchased this product in December 2011 as a present for my sister and her husband. It is now March 2012 (3 months later) and one of the metal rings of the band broke during a workout session and cut my sister's husband leg. It also bruised his foot and arm. I do not recommend these until the company fixes the problem as these are dangerous. Will be returning and putting in a complaint directly to the company. Amazon should not carry these.,1.0
"Honestly, deceiving is the right title for this review.  I purchase these bands with intentions of getting more resistance in my workout. Instead, they began to tear after 2nd week of training. So I was very dissatisfied with the product. It's back to dumbells for me !",1.0
"The materials and construction are top notch.  I did return these however, due to the fact that the exercises for the legs are not enough for me.  The book I bought to go along with this did explain that the lower body did not receive as good a workout as the upper body using resistance bands.  IF that had been in the description of the product where I could have view the information BEFORE buying I would NOT have bought it and be out the shipping to return the merchandize to them.  Which is really my one and only complaint.  But since I am out that money and have no product to show for it I feel it is a serious complaint.",1.0
"After reading all the great reviews I was very excited to get these bands, however after using them I am incredibly disappointed. I wish I could give this product a higher rating. Unfortunately, I am unable to use them because of my height. I am 6' 5"" and because of this, doing basic exercises like bicep curls or tricep extensions are impossible today because I am stretching the bands way past their normal tensile strength. I would have tried to keep using them, however the blue band was already starting to show some wear and tear after only a few uses.",1.0
"I just received this set of bands and upon first time using it, black (heaviest resistance supposedly) snapped on me and now my shoulder hurts. I am extremely upset and want to warn everyone out there who is planning to buy this set to be extra careful and think twice. It might happened to you...In the box seller is asking to resolve issues peacefully without leaving negative feedback. I will not leave negative feedback because it seems like seller is reputable and willing to exchange/return, but I am leaving this review for people to raise awareness as it is very dangerous and potentially harmful.",1.0
Broke in week 6 of P90X.  The blue band snapped back on my foot.  I thought I broke a toe but it's just black and blue.,1.0
"The red band(heaviest resistance) started tearing the first time I used it, so for obvious reason I stopped and tried the black one. The black one lasted fine for the exercise, but the next day it started ripping in the same place as the red one. I will not use the other colors as they simply do not have enough resistance.  A big minus is that this set has only one pair of handles and to switch from one handle to another is a big inconvenience and a waist of time.",1.0

"its a cute little knife. but it is even smaller than it seems like in the photo. I wanted a super small karambit similar to some of the hidden karambits used traditionally. While the blade is just where I want it to be the handle is so small that it makes the whole affair a joke. There is no way to get a four finger grip on this thing, and I have small girly hands. Also the ring is so small as to make it not possible to get the ring over anything but the first two phalanx of the finger. It makes for a cute little utility knife only. Something cool for a small person learning about knives would be an ok use for it.

*** I had to revise my statement. This thing is a piece of junk. It is even too small even for some children's hands. There is no good use for this thing at all. It is a waste of steel.",1.0

"My kit arrived with parts missing. Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots.

I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back. What a disappointment.",1.0
"I rarely write reviews and almost never write negative ones, but on occasion I feel honor-bound to warn others against repeating my mistakes.  So there is no confusion: I am only reviewing Outers here, as Amazon's service and prices are both consistently excellent in my experience.

Quite simply, this Outers cleaning kit is garbage.  My first warning that I had wasted my money on a cheap kit came upon receipt of the package.  The thicker of the two included cleaning rods had its plastic handle completely broken to the point where it slid right off the brass, rendering it unusable.  From the nature of the damage, it was pretty evident that this happened at the factory, not in transit.  ""No problem,"" I figured, ""I have my one-piece graphite rod, which is the only one I plan to use anyway.""  I bought it for the brushes and jags, after all, not the rods.

So just yesterday I went out to the range with my brand new, custom-built .308 rifle and started shooting.  After a bit of shooting, I went to clean the barrel per my gunsmith's instructions.  The .30 brush went through the barrel much too easily for my tastes, but I kept going.  Then I screwed the .30 plastic jag onto the rod to push through a few patches.  Well, I doubled up the patches to give it more pressure, as the jag with just one patch was going through too easily (just like the brush did).  The jag is total cheap crap, I discovered, as it promptly broke off *WHILE* *INSIDE* *MY* *BARREL*.  The plastic threaded part remained stuck inside the graphite rod, so I couldn't even screw the rod back onto the jag and pull it out.  I had to send the now-empty rod (*very* carefully) down from the crown and push the jag and patch out that way.

Furious, I packed up all my equipment, drove to a nearby sporting goods store, and sought help with getting the threaded part of the jag out of the rod.  It took the poor guy quite a while to do it because the plastic was just so soft, but eventually he got it.  On another store employee's advice, I bought A Hoppe's brass jag and a new Hoppe's .30 brush-and-hurricane-brush combo package.  Those are all working beautifully.  Hoppe's, he told me, builds the best cleaning equipment out of all the popular, mainstream gun maintenance companies.

Well, my lesson has been learned.  I will never buy *anything* made by Outers again; their equipment is cheaply made rubbish.  Hereafter I'm sticking with Hoppe's except when and where I become convinced--from personal experience, never from others' reports--another company offers higher-quality equipment.  And for the rest of my life Outers will never get a second chance.

I am extremely disappointed in this gun cleaning kit. The first time I used it the plastic cloth holders broke off inside the gun rods. Absolutely the worst gun cleaning kit I have ever seen.

"Looks fantastic. Fits in my pocket wonderfully.

And the absolute worst out of the box blade I've ever bought. I can't even get the blade to trim my fingernail. Both blades have a jagged, very rough finish. I have a 7 year old $20 winchester Wal-Mart knife that has never been this bad on it worst day. I was driving home and was so disgusted with it that I almost threw it out the window. I'll try and put an edge on it when I get home, but I've honestly never seen a brand new, out of the box blade with an edge that ruined. This is my first Case knife and for the money I could have gotten another tenacious from spyderco and been in heaven.
If I can get an edge on it, I'll leave another review.

"This knife is a Rust Bucked!  Yes it is beautiful.  However, if you do not wipe the blades down each and every day ( and who has time for that) it will indeed rust!  I received knife as a gift and I loved it and kept it in my pocked every day for the past 5 months.  I rarely cut anything with it for fear of messing it up!  I periodically opened the blades to admire it and  and even put some oil on blades.  Then Hot Summer weather came.  Last week I took it out of my pocked and opened the blades and to my dismay I saw several heavy rust spots!  I mean HEAVY rust.  I sanded the rust down with light 300 grot sand paper and removed it - but the rust had already etched into the blades!  Today I tried some Flitz metal polish on it and that unfortunately even removed part of the etched in Canoe with the Indian!!!!  The knife accumulates moisture on the blades merely from being in your pants pocket as you are doing outdoor work in the summer!  Few people have time to check and examine blades each and every day; besides with the sharp blades it is dangerous!

"8/15/2014 - Update
Barely been used in years now, terrible.  Going to take it down, chuck it in the garbage when I have the time.

Original review:

I was fairly disappointed in this toy.  Here are my issues with it:
1) The basketballs get stuck between the rim and the netting while you're playing.  As a result you either have to run around the side and knock the ball out, during the game, or you leave the stuck ball, and play with one less basketball and interference.
2) The collapsible / extendable ramp is extremely weak and flimsy.  The extending arm broke within the first hour of play, because my son leaned on it while knocking out a stuck ball.  See #1
3) The balls tend to roll off the ramp, because the ramp has no ""catch"" for the balls.  So you end up using only 2 balls because the 3rd keeps rolling off the ramp.
4) Fit and finish of the mounting bracket holes don't line up with mounting bracket well, so you have to force the bolts through
5) Mounting bracket is positioned right on top of the control panel, which makes it very difficult to get your fingers into the space to tighten the mounting nut
6) The instructions indicate to put the cabinet 6-7 feet above the ground, but the instructions do NOT indicate the clearance necessary from the ceiling, about 5 inches, (you need some extra space because of the way it mounts to the wall).  In my case I mounted it too near the ceiling, and then needed to remove the wall mount, lower it, and remount.  Sort of a pain in the butt.",1.0
We ordered this for a christmas gift for our 8 year old son.  After just 3 shots the basket disconnected from the rim due to a poor weld -- the joint between the basket and the plate that connects the basket to the backboard was completely rusted.  We are trying to contact the manufacturer.,1.0
This board is a piece of crap. It took me only a few tries to realize it was a bug mistake and I needed to buy the more expensive quality board.,1.0
"I know it's great because is WAY cheaper than the Indo Board or any other substitute, but it's really a bad product. I wanted a cheap board so I bought this one but after using it one day it started falling apart. Materials are HORRIBLE.

I'm now buying a more expensive one because I really liked the concept of the board, but this one would last less than a month. Too bad that is the only cheap board, but trust me, is not worthy.",1.0
The first one we received had a crack in the board. We were able to exchange it in a timely manner no problem which is the only reason it gets 1 star (also you can't give less). When we opened up the replacement we discovered the new board to be in pieces.,1.0
"I didn't realiza when I purchased that inexpensive meant poorly made and designed. It did not run smoothly, and it chewed up the ""rollers"" (which you have to assemble). I am returning it for a refund, hoping to have no issues with that.",1.0

"This product is beautiful in design and I love that there is more than one game to be played.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for it coming broken.  This was supposed to be a Christmas present and I cannot tell you the importance of it to the person receiving it.  To be fair, I am sure it was probably damaged in shipping, however, if it got damaged twice then the company providing this product should package it better.  It needs to have all four corner with styrofoam pieces because someone must have dropped it before or after it left the center... TWICE! I feel that it would deserve 5 stars if the product was better packed for shipping.  The first time was damaged beyond repair on one corner making it impossible to play.  The second time there are smaller cracks in two corners and I am just not going to waste any more time shipping back and receiving a new one only for it to be damaged again.  I have lost faith in getting a quality product.  But as I have said, the importance of this product in the timing in our lives is so great that I am forced to try to glue it back together and hope for the best.  If it breaks beyond repair after that, I will just eat the money.  Thank you, whoever, for making my heartfelt gesture a failure...",1.0
"I bought this item for Christmas, but it was shattered to pieces when I opened the box Christmas morning.",1.0
"This product was purchased to counter the expensive cost of the Indo boards. The big problem with the board is the roller that you have to assemble from half a dozen pieces of cutout plywood or composite wood. After bolting the pieces together and giving it a spin, I was immediately disappointed by the performance of this. Then upon inspection of the material used for the roller, I noticed immediate wear or deformation of the pressed wood substance and expect this piece to be useless within a month of use.
I have used other boards to include the Indo boards for hours on end with no such problems. Most of the other makes use a solid piece of wood or molded plastic with great results.

If I had it to do over I would spend the extra money and get the Indo board without hesitation.",1.0
"This product looked  like it was going to be great from the picture on-line, but once we got it opened and saw how it had to be put together and the cheap wooden parts, we were very disappointed.  We did follow the instructions to put it together (the ""roller"" part is a combination of round and square pieces of wood that alternate on a metal rod)
and found that it didn't even work.  Our overall opinion is that this Balance board will be the cheapest one you find on-line, in price as well as in quality!",1.0
"I had a dangerous experience while testing this product.  I bought the balance board with excitement because it resembled others I have seen before.  I had an elementary aged child test it out.  He was so enthusiastic!  I held his hand as he got on the board, when he felt comfortable he let go.  Oh my goodness!  That board went dangerously fast left and then right.  It slid out from under him.  He landed on his side on our carpet and was---thankfully---fine.  After telling this story to an experienced skateboarder and hockey player, he asked to try the balance board on carpet as well.  He is an adult with much 'balance' in his life.  The board went wild under him and was difficult to control.  He agreed, not a good fit to use unless surpervised by an adult with elementary aged children.  It is dangerous.  I suppose if you are an adrenline junky, this might be fun.  And a good project for children.  Tell them the story above and have them problem solve how to make this balance board better.  As I believe the top is good, but the circular cylinder underneath creates hazardous curves.  Children will explore the world around them trying to figure out balance.  A wonderful thing for the brain and then maybe they can create a better balance board for the market!",1.0
"This arrived on the 7th day after ordering, but when gently removed from the box, turned out to be broken.  The pine dowels that make up one sidewall were diagonally broken through, and the lowest of them was broken in two places, and had therefore fallen off.  I could have glued them, and still put it to use, but the playing surface of the board is also split along two parallel cracks, about 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 inches inside the broken sidewall, ruining the playing surface.",1.0
Silly me I did not do my research. First of all this company's name is obviously Carrom. However it has nothing to do with the official game of Carrom. You cannot play the real game of Carrom on this board. Neither of the two sides of this board have an official layout of the real Carrom game. To bad the manufacturer does not emphasis this in their description. Maybe they think that people won't buy it if that's what they really want. I was also surprised to find that there are no YouTube demonstrations on how to use this game board from the Carrom Company. I did find two video's about the game board that were less than a minute long but they were not for instructional purposes. Maybe someone has found some non-company demo's but I could not. Regardless I will keep the board as it was cheap enough. And I do mean cheap. The cue sticks are really just dowel rods and one of mine was already warped so I just went to the hardware store and bought another one. You can buy a real Carrom Game Board from Amazon but they are not cheap. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING!!!!,1.0
"Very disappointed in the horrible quality. It took all of four uses (by grandma and 8-year-old daughter - not exactly rough users) for a dime-size part of the fake wood surface to come off, exposing some paper-like material. My husband grew up with a carrom board made out of real wood and said this is nothing like it. We will send it back. Too bad because those few rounds of play were fun.",1.0

"I am not sure what this product is! It is definitely not what I grew up playing, or consider a carrom board. Not sure how it qualifies for large.

If I didn't get it on a super deal, I would definitely be returning it.",1.0
"This is not the same quality product that I grew up with. My parents purchased a carrom board in the 1960's, that received much use, and still does from the grandkids. That board of the '60's is very sturdy, is still in great shape, even though as kids we were not very kind to it. The carrom board that was shipped to us, didn't survive the shipping process intact(at least I assume that may have been the cause). We opened the box with the intent of having a fun evening of playing carroms. The board came out of the box with the frame around the board broken, two of the plastic corners were broken, of course the frame would not stay attached to the board, the corner pockets were falling out also. This carrom board doesn't seem to be very sturdy. The box that the carrom board was shipped in was undamaged, remarkable! (Maybe it was not the shipping process.) We had no inkling that the contents would be in poor shape. I packaged everything up the best I could and sent it back. So very disappointing.",1.0
"Ordered this for a gift for my niece, and it arrived broken in half and my sister said it was made out of cheap partical board. So, it goes without saying...

addendum: I called customer service to complain, and say that my sister did not want to return the item as it was too much trouble. The only thing they offered was to refund me $15 which is half the original price. Not sure I feel this was the best they could have done...",1.0
too big! way tooooo big!  cheaply made and packaged. if u are not planning on buying the quadpoid then don't bother buying this exact item.,1.0
"The game is much like what I played with at camp, except the quality.  The unit came apart as it was pulled out of the box.  The construction is really poor.  The pockets are on a flimsy wire and probably will not last.  The rails do not stay together.  I am surprised that they were not even glued in to the end corner pieces.  After several frustrating games, I screwed the corners together to keep it from coming apart.  You may be able to glue it.

As far as some of the other posts complaining about sticks and game pieces, they seem to be the same as I can recall.  So no complaints.

I gave one star due to having to screw the sides together.",1.0
"This MIGHT be a good product for a 3-5 year old who doesn't kick with much power. However, after only a few sessions from a 7 year old the cords have already broken. I wish I could get my money back for such trashy equipment and give it 0 stars. ",1.0
Didn't even make it through the summer before the net snapped on the bottom from minimal use.,1.0
"Franklin ships this soccer goal with thin bungee straps that secure the net to the frame.  As the soccer ball bounces off the net, friction causes the bungee straps to rub against the metal frame.  After a few months of an 8-year old playing with the goal a few times a week, the straps started to fray and break.  After a year, 2/3 of the bungee straps are broken and the goal is unusable.  I reached out to Franklin support and the net and straps are under warranty for only three months!  However, replacement bungee cords are available for purchase!  This appears to be an intentional design flaw to drive part replacement sales. So, if you'd like a rebounder to last more than a few months before it starts falling apart, look for a different brand that uses rubber rings instead of bungee cords.  It is well worth the extra assembly time to get a more durable product that can be left outside in the weather.  The short warranty window is indicative of how long you can expect this product to last.",1.0
"Purchased this as a gift for our grandson.  Within 30 minutes of assembly the ball went throught the net!!!  Unfortunately in getting this back to us, we missed the return deadline, so we are stuck with this and our grandson doesn't yet have a rebounder.",1.0

I do not recommend this at all! After one kick out of the box the net tore!,1.0
Really unhappy with this purchase. I purchased as a gift for my niece and nephew and they just set it up with weather clearing up. After about 10 minutes of kicking balls at the goal the net broke. This was from a 4 year old boy and 8 year old girl. I played college soccer so I hate to see what would happen if I kicked a ball at it. Because we took awhile to set it up while the weather warmed up I can no longer return it. I wouldn't recommend this goal as I am not sure it will last long.,1.0
I have not yet opened the box as it's a gift. The mailing box was undamaged but the products box was severely damaged on one side. I have pictures for documentation.,1.0
Item seems fine but package came without instructions and missing hardware. Went to Franklin sports for instructions and then relized it's also supposed to come with screws that this didn't come with,1.0
Don't buy this.  Got a hole in the net the first day.  Will try to contact Franklin sports because I waited too long to return to Amazon.  Pretty bad that a 10 year old can kick a ball through it,1.0
"Design flaw:  The lower cross-bar (along the front that sits at the bottom), bends slightly upward in the middle due to the tension of the elastics holding the net tight.  So, if you kick the ball along the ground, even with a strong kick, it hits the bar and not the net, so there is no ""rebounder"" effect.  I and my boys (ages 7 and 8) were really disappointed by this, so unfortunately, after the initial couple of trials and disappointments, it's never been used.",1.0
Net fell apart quickly.  Now all we have is the frame.,1.0

The shipment packet was all tarnished and scuffed just like a returned item would look like. This would not have been a problem in itself except that there were missing critical parts. I had to improvise to assembly the net. Unfortunately only after 3 uses the net broke. This seller clearly does not respect the buyers not only by sending used packets for what should have been a new item but also the minimum quality level is not existing. Might as well label it - One Time Use ! Do not recommend this product,1.0
"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for our children. Life has been quite busy, and we are now finally able to assemble it---or rather try to assemble it. It was missing a critical piece and is now a pile of junk. In addition, there weren't any instructions. When it arrived, the box was all taped up, as though it had been purchased, returned and then re-sold. Obviously not inspected for parts before it went out again!!! We live in the Adirondacks. Even if we could have assembled it, it would have been in May, beyond the  return point allowed. This totally stinks!!!",1.0
"I bought this for my 14 year old nephew's birthday.  He got it all set up and the netting ripped after the second time he kicked the ball at it.  Not sure if it was a defect or very cheaply made, but I was not very impressed with the quality of this product.  Unless you're buying it for a young child who can't kick the ball very hard, I would avoid this product.",1.0
"the net has already ripped. My two daughters ages 10 and 15 use it and the net now has a hole in it. I purchased this on May 8th, and the net was very thin in some places and frayed.  hoped it would be ok, but just not great quality. This may be adequate for someone learning, but for any skilled player, or someone using some decent amount of force I would say this may not be what you are looking for.",1.0
We had this up for 2 days for my 11 years old grandson when he kicked a ball and it put a hole in the net.  Would have been perfect for him if the netting material was stronger.  Why put out a product that is suppose to handle repeated soccer balls kicks if it is going to tear right away?,1.0

I'm still waiting for a response, other than the automated one I got. Maybe I'll post another review on the actual product if we ever get to use it.",1.0
"At first, the product looked as advertised. As we put it together and started using it, it became more and more of a disappointment. The bottom of frame is bending where the poles are ""clicked into place"" after cords are put on to hold net.

Also the soccer net is cut,/ripped in 3 different places; The corners of the net are braided rope. 2 of the 3 ropes in the braid on 2 corners arrived cut/broken.  Not sure how long the system will be usable!",1.0
The net broke after 2 practices. Not sure if that can be replaced separately.  Need to find out if one can get refunded.,1.0
Fell apart first week. Its a kickback- and its in pieces on my lawn.  Not made well. Dont' waste your money.,1.0
"I have purchased two of these. The first one when my son was 11 lasted about 1 year. For the price, we got a lot of hours of fun and it was a good product. The second one lasted about 2 months. The week link is in the bottom front pole. Even the net tension makes it warp and after some strong kicks from a 12 year old, it bends up about a foot and makes the goal unusable.

There are three real problems. It comes with only a 90 day warranty, the only available repair part is the net, and there is zero customer service. I emailed customer service to see if I could get a replacement bottom front rail and they simply never answered me.

This is an affordable rebounder for young children but stay away if anyone can kick a little bit hard or you are expecting a friendly and responsive customer service.

UPDATE: I found a solution for the lower front pole. I took two pieces of concrete rebar that was scrap from a construction site, removed the pole, inserted the rebar inside the pole, and reattached. That pole will never bend again! :)",1.0
We assembled this item on a Wednesday and by Sunday the net had already broken in several places. My kid had not even used the net before it frayed.,1.0

"One of these big, heavy, griddles will fit smartly over two burners and let you make a lot of (for example) pancakes or French toast at one time. If you season as directed, and use oil or fat in addition, sticking won't be a problem.
Lodge cast iron is great, but this griddle is not well-designed. Its two-sidedness at first seems clever but in fact,  by being ""reversible,"" with both sides usable for cooking, the ""seasoning"" on the side toward the burner gets wrecked each time you cook. In addition,  being virtually handleless, it is nearly impossible to move when hot. It's meant to stay put - on your stove.  You have to leave it alone for a good hour, before washing up. Later, in the sink, the weight and size of this griddle is inconvenient. (Cast iron scratches porcelain.) I went back to my pans.",1.0
"I have another cast iron kitchen product and am very happy with that one. So I bought this griddle, seasoned it according to instructions and started using it. However, everything sticks to it, making it hell to clean up. I even reseasoned it after one big clean up job, but that didn't help either. I now bought a calphalon griddle and couldn't be happier.",1.0
"First thing I noticed is how extremely heavy this thing is!  It is very difficult to maneuver.
I followed the seasoning instructions, but on first use, my pancakes stuck like cardboard with super glue [imagine the expletives that came out of my mouth].
I also noticed that the heat does not distribute evenly, so you really can't use the entire cooking surface.
Needless to say, this thing is sitting in the garage awaiting my next yard sale.",1.0

"I picked one of these up at Target for 14.99 and put it on my bike today and it is a piece of garbage.  I'll be taking it right back.

The mounting bracket is terrible and doesnt fit the lock well.

The lock itself is covered with a plastic covering that moves around when inserting on the mounting bracket and covers the locks so you cant place the U portion on the locking mechanism.

Once you finally finagle it the plastic cover around so you can secure it.  The lock itself wobbles back and forth when you ride.  It doesnt matter how tight you have it attached to the mounting bracket because it moves around inside the plastic covering.

"Piece of junk. Waste of money. Garbage. Does not deserve one star. Zero stars. Negative stars.

It felt like a piece of garbage from the first time I put the key in, but it's for a crappy around-the-town bike that I only paid $10 for, so I wasn't too concerned about high security. I found that every time I locked or unlocked my bike I'd spend a few seconds trying to get it to open. After a month it stopped working entirely--my bike was locked up at the train station a mile from my house.

I called Master and they immediately offered to send a replacement. What about my bike, I asked. Just cut it off, they said. I cut the lock off with bolt-cutters, and the next day the new lock came it the mail. Great, I thought, that first one must have been a lemon. But the new one was just as crappy, and like an idiot, I used it for three weeks, struggling to get it open every time.

And now my bike is locked up and this piece of crap won't open. In the morning I'll call Master and they'll offer to send me a new one. I will demand my money back, and eventually buy the Kryptonite that I should have gotten in the first place.",1.0
"The lock mechanism is the worst I've ever seen. My key jammed and broke off after only two months. Even under regular conditions, it'd still take an average of 60-90 seconds to lock or unlock the bike.

"All I can say is I'm glad that the lock broke when my bike was NOT locked up with it and when I did not have to rush out to pick up my son from daycare.

I bought this lock less than a week ago. I didn't even have time to install the bracket yet. The lock appeared to be working fine, but this morning when I went to lock up my bike at work, I stuck the key in and turned it, but wasn't able to unlock the lock. So I tried again and realized something was off. I looked at the key and in the key hold and realized THE TIP OF THE KEY HAD BROKEN OFF INTO THE KEY HOLE.

This happened on a perfect, warm, spring day (i.e. not in the dead of winter when things crack all of the time) and with normal use.

After a few weeks the lock will be nearly impossible to open. You will have to spray it down with some type of lubricant to get it to open. After that, it will always be hard to open.

"This is a rip-off, piece of junk.  And becuase I didn't get a chance to try to install this within the 30 days (my son received it as a gift while we were away), now I can't return it!! The pole is two pieces that don't fit well together, so its wobbly and unstable, plus the pole is smaller than the sleeve so that increases the wobble of the pole - it's impossible to assemble this perpendicular to the ground. Plus the people at Park & Sun need to bone up on their math skills...The poles together are 11 ft. The sleeve is only about 10 inches. If you assemble according to directions, you have 10'2"" of pole height (with only 10"" in the ground, that's not very stable). Regulation tetherball is supposed to be 9 ft. - it says so right in the directions. They need to improve their quality control (make pieces that really fit together) and write better directions. The quality of the rope is very poor too -- it was already frayed coming out of the box. If you go as far as buying it, keep the package, becuase without it you can't return it and you're going to want to return it.",1.0
"I was concerned about the pole being assembled from two pieces, and that was exactly what was wrong with it. Once assembled, the pole was extremely wobbly since (1) the ground sleeve was too short to keep the lower pole piece firmly in place, and (2) the top pole section, once inserted into the bottom, is very unstable.  Better solution is to just go to your local fence supplier and buy an 11 foot section of 1 5/8 inch or 1 3/4 inch fence post and matching ground sleeve (min 12 inches, or longer - just make sure to extend the pole length to accomodate the longer ground sleeve).  Then just buy the rope and ball set.  My local fence co charged $25, and that included a cap and eye ring at one end so I could connect a teatherball rope.  FYI, I tried to contact Park and Sun for their feedback about my comments and they never bothered to reply.  Don't waste your money.",1.0

Very upset the frames were bent.  It is being returned for a new one.  I hope my daughter has sent it back. I will try and produce and return for them,1.0
After less than 5 months of use by 8 year old kids this goal cracked at the base and and can no longer stand upright.  No wonder they only offer a 1 month return policy.  :(,1.0
My kids got this as a Christmas gift. We didn't open it until now because we live in Minnesota. I opened it only to see that 2 pieces are bent. We can't return it because it's been too long but can't put it together either! Very disappointed and what a waste of money,1.0
These arrived dirty and used.,1.0
"Very poor net. For something I paid for near $100, I wouldn't expect to have to worry about the poor frame quality, how the things holding the net come off easily, and how wobbly it is when you hit the frame. Also, it seems the packagers that put the parts into a box are pretty lazy, because I had a part missing. To make matters worse, it took me 2 days and 15 calls to finally reach Franklin support. Then, two weeks later, the part finally came. I recommend staying away from this net as much as possible.",1.0
Some of the parts in the box are defective. I ordered it twice and returned it twice as I was not able to build the Goal out of these parts. Tried to contact the seller but he did not respond.,1.0
"After only three weeks of use at a small school where all the usage has been supervised, the frame broke!  Very disappointed in this product! Buyer beware!",1.0
We ordered two (2) goals for xmas for the kids.  One was perfect the other was missing a the next and parts?!,1.0
The net did not fit the frame and we had to call them and order a new one.,1.0
Terrible quality.  After owning one week I left them out one day accidentally and they became discolored and warped. When I picked up the base the corner tore off.  It took about 4 more weeks before it was torn to shreds.  These are intended for very delicate use. The rubber is very thin.,1.0
"Poor quality, net gets holes just from kicking the ball in and the poles are rusting already. Very disappointing. I wuld send it back if I could.",1.0
Got for my 7 year old son and after 3 days he kicked the ball and hit the post  bending it so bad I need to return it.  Weak construction material and obviously won't last long if it can't handle a child's kick.,1.0
"I should have known that this goal for $100 from Franklin Sports was going to be worthless. The net is flimsy, the frame is light weight aluminum, and the velcro ties so cheap the don't even hold the net with a moderate kick. let alone a hard kick.

The binoculars stopped working after 6 months. They will not focus. Unable to return.,1.0
"Lenses quickly clouded by humidity.  IN THE DESERT.  These are not suitable for outdoor, or indoor use.  Manufacturer had no comment.",1.0
"Bought this once, and it never arrived. Bought again a d took to Alaska and the entire trip had double vision. No matter how many adjustments I made. Can't explain how mad and disappointed I was to be in Alaska with defective binoculars.",1.0
The optical/mechanical parts worked as supposed to. But the real problem was that the neck strap was poorly made and one end of it was basically loose nylon threads upon arrival. I emailed Bushnell and requested a replacement. They emailed me and asked me to buy one from their parts department. I never bothered and it has since been collecting dust for 9 months.,1.0
"I have the same brand and model which were manufactured in Japan many years ago and they're great -.very sharp, clear, easy to focus. THIS pair is made in China and are junk. Focusing is impossible since when using the ""Insta Focus"" both eye tubes don't travel together meaning you have to constantly refocus the right eye piece. The eye tubes wobble up and down when focusing.  Would be fun for kids (maybe) but for someone looking for an inexpensive pair of binoculars I cannot recommend these.",1.0
eye pieces don't move together they bind up and are loose,1.0
These binoculars create nonconvergent double images. I had several different family members test the binoculars to make sure the problem is with the binoculars and not something unique to one viewer.  Everyone who looked through them reported the same thing - headache inducing misaligned double images.  I'm surprised by this defect as I have other Bushnell binoculars which work perfectly.  I'm awaiting word from the seller that they will refund my purchase.,1.0
Bought it for family gift. Lenses are not aligned properly. Defective unit received,1.0

"Hard to focus, I can't use them.",1.0
"We bought a pair of these binoculars for our son several years ago.  Pretty decent for inexpensive binoculars.  Unfortunately, Bushnell has cheapened the design and parts used in manufacture of these now.  While they look nearly the same as the old ones, they aren't.  Way to much slop in the adjustment.  In fact, there is a point where they stick as you are going through the adjustment.  The old pair are considerably smoother in adjustment.  The lens are also a bit foggy.  The rubber around one of the eyepieces somehow got deformed when I packaged them back up, so obviously the rubber (if you can call it that - seems more like some rubber/plastic combination) isn't very good quality.

Unfortunately, these aren't even worth the cheap price.  I should have sent them back, but got lazy and missed the 30 day window.  I would definitely look for something else if you want an inexpensive pair of binoculars that have some modicum of quality.",1.0
focus is sticky no clear,1.0
"My wife was so proud that she found some binoculars at a descent price, all I was thinking was- OH NO! I opened them knowing bushnell is an ok name for cheap optics, not good, but ok. Upon viewing through them, my fear was confirmed. These were terrible and had to return them, luckily we could return them. Both pairs were the same. The parallax is completely off with no adjustment possible to fix the issue. Looking through them, you start to form an instant headache then realizing the image shift from one eye to the other is several feet off at 100'. all distances even up close the images between one eye and the other are off making these useless unless you decide to keep one eye closed at all times. Having said that, they make an ok scope, or if you have an eye patch, born with one eye, or just blind in one eye, cyclops, then it will be ok. As for anyone not in that category, you are best suited to hit your local shops and test some until you find a pair that actually work better than a mono scope.",1.0
"This is the worst purchase I've ever made through Amazon.  I trusted Bushnell as a reputable binocular manufacturer, boy was I wrong.  I haven't had this model of binoculars for even 5 months, and it is completely out of focus.  You can not use the focus roller to make a close and CLEAR view.  It is blurred regardless of which way you use the focus device.  I am sorry I can't return for a full refund, but I can't find my invoice receipt.",1.0
"One of the lenses arrived broken, could not focus on anything.",1.0
The range and clarity is very ppor,1.0
I guess you really do get what you pay for. These are more for children rather than an adult.  Really doesn't assist in viewing distant items at all.  VERY VERY disappointed.,1.0
You will just love the double vision you get from the Bushnell Falcon 7x35 Binoculars! I would recommend sawing them in half and using them as a telescope. I read the reviews on the web and everyone says the same thing about the double vision. Harbor Freight tools has a cheap set of Binoculars better than these. I called Bushnell and they blamed me because the only way that could happen is for them to be dropped. They never were dropped and were bad out of the box. Horrible product horrible company.,1.0
"Love!

I used 3 times... now they are blurry and foggy. What happened?",1.0
These aren't strong at all.  I can see better without them.  Don't waste your money.,1.0
"This is my second Bushnell and its equally bad. No matter how I adjust the eyepieces, focussing or angle, the image on each eye appear separate and do not converge to be one. Tasco is way way better.",1.0
"Trash!!! Don't buy, take money and put on a good set. I give it zero stars but I can't submit review without one star. Only had three months at the house and the second day of hunting season the lenses broke and you can't focus them. Garbage",1.0
"We did not take us back shipment is returned because it is forbidden to enter our country, I hope to return the shipment and recognizing coins",1.0
unable to focus,1.0
Extremely difficult to project the lenses so that the farthest objects are clearly visible as well as extremely bulky.,1.0
"Not a good quality. I don't know how can this product has 4,5 stars. you can't regulate it or zoom it, u can only see same way distance. Not happy at all.",1.0
"Don't buy these.  Returned the first set because of optics weakest, no distance.  Even at maximum adjustment the focus is borderline.  Flimsy device and low strength optics.",1.0
Too heavy returning,1.0
"i was so looking forward to getting these, but when i got them I took them out , read the instructions for focusing them. But could not get to see one image no matter what I did. So I was thinking I would wait to for my husband to come in and see if he could get them to work. But then I looked at them and noticed that the Lens on right side was positioned crooked. No way would they ever focus right, so back in the box and already printed out the return label. Best thing about Amazon, doesn't happen often but when it does it is not problem to return things. Think I am going to do a bit more research and pay a bit more. The thing just didn't look put together right even the other parts aside from the lens.",1.0
Cheap. Does not see far. Took to the rain forest and was not much help,1.0
So short view,1.0
The lenses have a manufacturing defect. It is useless.,1.0
I knew going in that they were only a 1 star binocular. As they will be used by clients I only wanted to pay low end and I got what I needed. And they were at a lower price than I expected so I am satisfied.,1.0
Hard to focus and no distance to them,1.0
Had to return. Not good at all. Could hardly see out of the binoculars,1.0
"These  were advertised as suitable for children. I purchased a pair for my 10-year old grandson. He treated them very carefully and after about a week of use, one of the eye pieces came off in his hand.  I was travelling internationally at the time, and when I got back and attempted to ""return or replace"" the item, I was unable to do either because the ""return"" window had elapsed. A very unsatisfying experience.",1.0
"Very bad quality and contruction, not worth for money, the old Japan version is far better than China version ( i have both of models to compare them). Advoid away. Bushnell is killing themself with this product.",1.0
"I purchased the Bushnell Falcon 7x35 due to the positive reviews.  However, the pair I received were defective.  Only one eye piece could be adjusted and the other one was non-adjustable so back they went for a full refund.",1.0
"They broke already!  Mainly they sat on the bar in the kitchen waiting for my wife to spot something interesting around the pond, and then went right back to rest.  Very light use.  One day the quick focus lever just stopped quick focusing.  Now they are useless.",1.0
Dropped it three feet and now I'm seeing double. I recommend paying a little more money for a sturdier set.,1.0
"Do not buy, while some may be good the one I received was a POS. Probably should have returned but they pissed me off so that I hurled them at the concrete. They did not line up and gave a double vision effect.",1.0
and information from customer service did not come through. We were very disappointed with this transaction.  We were unable to secure any before we left on our vacation.,1.0
On both sets the big lenses did not seem to match left to right.  Viewing resulted in double vision.  I changed to Nikon. Happy now.,1.0
"Simply put, anyone who bothered to look through the viewfinders would see that these binoculars are not working and have not been reconditioned. As this would be so easy to check I just do not understand how and why these would be sent out as they were.",1.0
"I don't know anything about binoculars and just wanted a pair for casual backyard bird watching. I took a risk ordering a pair that was so inexpensive and had some poor reviews... It was not worth it. The adjustment of the lenses was so off that there was about 6 feet of separation between images at 30 feet or so. They were totally unusable. Perhaps the better reviews got a good pair and I got a bad pair, but it was not worth the risk buying another pair to see. Obviously, there are some quality control issues. In general, the quality seemed really poor. If you pushed a little too much on one side (with your eye/head) it would bend the plastic hinge in the middle. Shouldn't the lenses always be aligned and not able to move? I dunno. Just seemed cheaply made. So I ended up buying the Pentax 62211 UCF-X II 8x25 at double the price instead.",1.0
"I bought these as starter birdwatching  binoculars for my son who recently got into the hobby.  I got these primarily for the price and the decent reviews, hoping that Bushnell had improved their quality over the last 20 years...  but, I wasn't surprised when my son said that the focusing mechanism broke within 2 months of his receiving them and it wasn't due to misuse or dropping them:  the plastic housing for the set-screw cracked, which no longer allowed proper focusing (and I couldn't repair it).  Actually, I should've known this would happen with Bushnell because my initial birdwatching binoculars were Bushnell and I remember them becoming fairly useless soon after I started using them on a regular basis.  It's been Nikon or Minolta for me ever since...  I guess I  should've started my son on one of those as well.  So, on to the ""store"" for something better for the new birder.",1.0

"It is much too hard to put together.  The directions do not provide much help. That is very frustrating. My grandaughter keeps asking if we can put it together, we need more tools i tell her, and it is a little pricey to have it put together by an outsude source- one store wanted $50 for assembly!- more than the cost of the bycicle!

The front fork is seeming plumb. However, the wheel/axle on the front is either bent or defective in some other way. So, entire assembly would lean left because the yoke was bent on the left side OR the holes for the mounting bolts were drilled and located incorrectly. This the second purchase of this exact model, to makeup for the first order which was missing the plastic washers and the yoke was bent. I am truly disappointed with the consistently inconsistent defects in the product. The diminished quality expectation leads me to believe there are more Radio Flyer tricycles with these exact same issues and all around is in-congruent with expected quality and satisfactory expectations of a first, and subsequently second-time, costumer of the same product.",1.0

I wouldn't sell this for $5, it belongs in a scrap yard.",1.0
"When I opened the box containing the tricycle manufacturer packaging, it was clear that this had been returned before.  There was a large rip in the side of the box that had been re-taped.  When I opened the manufacturer packaging I noticed that there were loose bolts in it.  Ultimately there were two missing nuts and bolts that made assembly impossible.

"This product is a good trade-off of performance for the price. We can even take hot showers, at least now in summer, while the temp calibrated to only 43C (110*F). It is simple to install and use/adjust.
To get maximum performance:
1. Install this unit at the point of use, not as whole house supply.
2. Use a water-efficient/ saver shower head. I bought this thing on Amazon: B014R4W6MY, its the control valve on and off, you install right at the shower head, so for example, during shower, you are using shampoo, instead turn off both valves at shower head, you just need to switch this valve to shutoff water while doing other things...then switch on again when finish. This valve is 1.5 GPM rate.
3. Reduce the flow from the hotline (to let it build up temperature) while mixing in cold water to get more flow/pressure at the shower head or faucet.
It really works better this way.",5.0
"Replaced a 50 gallon 9kW 240v. Works perfectly. No longer paying $0.50 a kW for storing hot water here in Hawaii. I could go with IR288 POU 8.8 kW 40AMP, which has more flow rate output vs. IR260 6.0 kW 30AMP, but since I have only 1 bathroom so IR260 would be more than enough for me. One faucet at a time, and if you are planning to run multiple faucets at the same time, go with IR288 POU or IR 14K220 POU.
And also in Hawaii, we don't have clean water, and so most of the electric tankless system out there in the market could not keep up because of the corrosion and limescale, and you have to keep flushing the system regularly and replace elements. I hope this is it.",5.0
Just what we wanted. Work great.,5.0
"Excellent unit, simple to install and quite efficient. Because of my power limitations i had to get this model, has few limitations vs IR14K or IR8000 however i love it. Provide enough 1 shower at a time for me (live in Hawaii), i have to dial gatevale down a bit because it was too hot. Also, it was so inexpensive compared to replacing my water heater tank. Now I have a very large pantry were the tank use to be and this IR260 is in the top of my linen closet.",5.0
"I am totally happy and amazed this unit works so well.  I didn't think it would be able to handle heating water for a shower.  Our 40 gallon hot water heater started leaking and I needed something temporary.  We had a 220v/30 amp #10 line there already for the tank.  Hooked everything up and get hot showers consistently.  One thing that made a difference was I used 1/2"" (under-sink type) supply and outlet lines instead of the 3/4"" lines that were connected to my tank heater.  Once I changed those it was much better.  Another thing to get used to is; for hotter water turn the shower knobs in 1/8th to 1/4 turns. The slower the flow, the hotter the water!  I said this was a temporary fix until we get our gas line hooked up.  We're converting all our appliances to gas. But I might just leave this unit there since it works so well. Also need to mention we live in Hawaii, I'm sure it works so well because our tap water comes out between 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit.",5.0
does what its suppose to do.  instant hot water until water from other end of house water heater gets there.  easy to install . just getting to old to craw thru attic to run wire though. works great.,5.0
"I had this IR260 unit for around a month before I was ready to install it.  I had a little trepidation about whether it would provide enough warm water for my application (small cabin, 2 sinks, one shower) but forged ahead and had no issues with the installation process.  Following the directions exactly, I turned the unit on and opened a sink faucet.  To my delight, warm water soon came out.  But the real test came when the shower hookup was complete and I went to try my first warm shower in the cabin.  This time, I got even more warm, actually hot, water and had to turn the shower down towards cold a bit so it wouldn't be too hot.  This unit is perfect for a small cabin or home with just one or two people using hot water.  The unit takes up so little space and I found it nearly a snap to install.  If you get one of these, make sure you turn the faucet hot water handle all the way on until the temp stabilizes before backing it off.  If you turn it on just a little, you'll get a ""beep beep"" from the unit indicating that there is a ""flow restriction error"" - what this means is there is not enough water flowing through the unit.  A leak anywhere in the system will cause this error to show as well - I found this out from having a screw cap at the end of the hot water line; the male adapter threads had no teflon tape on them so it leaked, hence the ""beep beep"".

On standby, the unit shows a ""4"" where the temperature usually is displayed - it would have been nice to know this beforehand as it is nowhere in the literature that came with the unit.  At first I was wondering what kind of problem or error this might be.  Perhaps a less confusing display for standby mode would have been ""SB"" and including this in the manual or instructions would have cleared everything up anyway.",5.0
"My husband selected this model because of the reviews. He originally ordered a unit that was too small for our needs, he contacted the company. they were very helpful. told him which model he should go to. they told him if he had any problems trying to return the first one just give them a call and they would help him.",5.0

It provides nearly instant hot water for the few times we need it a day, and we do not have to continuously heat a tank of water. It is the perfect solution. It was easy to install and worked immediately.",5.0

Was a little skeptical at first . a flow heater is a different creature than a tank but after a few lessons on how to get hot water I had to turn the beast down !  If it lasts with out service problems this will be the best buy of the year on Amazon . congrats to the designer,5.0
I like it a lot,5.0
"I bought this for my neighbor and he loves it. Came exactly as described, very sturdy.",5.0
Love this water heater!  Like it so much that id like to sell them to everyone. Its not big enough to do a whole house but its plenty good enough for running area if all water areas are close together. I have it heating water going to my poolhouse 20 feet away and can even take hot showers out there. I plan on running a solar water heater before it to preheat water to make it even more efficient.,5.0

This was a gift for my cousin who kept losing her hooks in the couch. I thought it would be perfect for her to keep them all in one place. It has been great.

"Fantastic item for Morris Canal and NJ history fans.  A great amount of leg work went into verifying the route of the canal in the context of the current rail and highway alignments.

Detailed maps and descriptions allow you to trace the entire canal, as much as is possible, from Phillipsburg to Jersey City.  It is broken down in sections that can easily be covered in a series of day trips.

The maps and descriptions show you which sections are walkable, and which are driving tours. It gives turn by turn directions including where to park your car for the hiking sections.

The maps alone are worth the price, but you get so much more from the author's team of true enthusiasts who put this together.",5.0

"This is the best bottle ever!.  I have filled it with water and ice in the mornings and maintained it in my car all day long, in the hot Florida summer weather, and it will be ice cold 8 hours later.  There will still be ice chips in side.  Very durable.  Everyone in the family now has their own.  I attach a careener so that they can be hung of sports bags and backpacks.",5.0

"Used as a prefilter sponge on the intake tube of my AquaClear 70 filters. I cut one in half, and use it for both. Prevents small fish from getting stuck or injured. Just make sure that there's not too much suction from the bottom as the water will find the path of least resistance. As long as the pickups are close to the bottom of the tank you shouldn't have a problem. If you are using a single intake tube and its at the mid-water level, you might have too much pull from the open end. Also provides more space for beneficial bacteria and obviously keeps the filters cleaner.",5.0

"This has been a big hit. He loves putting his stickers in the book. It's a nice non-screen activity we can do together. He now saves all the stickers he gets from the grocery store and the doctor's office so he can put them in his book. It's a lovely exercise in delayed gratification and he is so adorable showing off his ""collection"" to people. Nice quality, I can see it lasting for years and there are great themed pages that make it almost read like a book once it has some stickers in it.",5.0

I love the hologram on the front of the moving car too, my son loves it!  He really likes that he can change his mind and remove the stickers to put them on other pages when new stickers come in.  Highly recommend!!",5.0

"Was a bit skeptical at first mostly because the price seemed to good to be true. But after a couple of months with this product I can say that's it's a really impressive.

"I don't go anywhere without one of my hydro flasks.  They really do keep things hot or cold.  I love that I can put ice water in the water bottle in the morning then leave it in the car in the sun while I go for a couple hours of errands or a long run, and come back to nice ice cold water.  It is super durable too.  I have a bad habit of dropping things, and this has taken some good drops.  It has a few dents and paint chips, but it still has the vacuum and still works like a charm.  I had to purchase the larger version because my husband would always drink my water since it was cold, so now we have a big one to share.  I love them both, and the straw lid comes in handy with the big one because it gets heavy when it is full so it is easier to use the straw then to try and tip the beast up to drink from the pour lid.",5.0

"I looked high and low for a sticker book for my son.  Others were too girly or had character-specific themes, with all the added stickers that I didn't need or want.  This book had lots of pages, some with backgrounds (ie, in the ocean, at the park, on the road, in the sky, etc.) but they also had colored blank pages.  I thought the pouch at the end of the book for extra stickers was the perfect touch.  It is pricey, but worth it. Wish the book was bigger and had more pages in fact, but its great for small hands. The lenticular image of the car moving was pretty cool. I plan on getting more for birthday and holiday gifts.",5.0

"The Brief:
This was an excellent purchase.  Well crafted. Well priced. Excellent customer service from seller. Arrived promptly and packaged with care.

The Long:
This was bought as a gift for a rail fan in need of a coat rack.  I found this piece after searching various sites and vendors and being disappointed with the design and feel of the pieces offered on other sites.  This item is well designed featuring both a rustic feel and modern simplicity that truly allows you to appreciate the beauty of the wood, the railroad spikes, and the entire piece in general.

After deciding to buy, I was able to contact the seller, who worked with me one on one to help decide which piece was right for me. He offered variations in the staining as well as an option for an entryway piece with ""WELCOME"" on it.  He kept in close contact and worked with me on my delivery date needs and was extremely helpful throughout the entire process.  You get the impression that the seller is not only eager to assist, but proud/passionate about his work (as he should be).

The piece arrived exactly on time and in excellent condition.  The hanging mounts on the back on this piece were 32inches apart which makes it easy to hang and anchor into the studs (which you'll need to do as it is a sturdy piece with some weight to it).

As a gift, this went over incredibly well; to the point where the recipient grabbed a measuring tape immediately after opening to begin planning its placement.",5.0
Great product! Great quality! My 6-year-old son thinks it is awesome. Haven't found anything else like it. Would certainly recommend :),5.0
Took a chance with this as I was in need of a very specific look/feel.  The gamble paid off in a huge way as this rack has become the focal point in a high end remodel.  Customer was ecstatic and the workmanship is top notch.  This will be a go to piece for many future customers.,5.0
Rug as advertised and I am always looking for sheep themed items.  Seems to be good quality and very nice colors.,5.0

"I searched all around for a sticker book for my children, but could only find junky ones, until this.  It is more expensive than any others you will find, but well worth the money.  It is very well-made and spiral bound, with plenty of pages and just the right size.  The pages are categorized for ""food stickers"", ""sports stickers"", etc.  For you who grew up in the 80's collecting stickers...just like we had back then.  Perfect place for all of the stickers that come from the doctor, dentist and the slew that come through the mail from Mimi and Papa on a regular basis!",5.0

I love the various themed pages like ""in the garden"", ""in the sea"", ""at the beach"", ""in the sky"", and the blank pages in different colors. It even has a little pouch attached inside the back cover for extra sheets of stickers. Definitely happy with it and would recommend!",5.0
"If your kids are anything like mine, they LOVE stickers. I have probably spent hundreds of dollars on stickers in the last 8 years. I would buy  little books or journals for the kids to put their stickers in , but then once they were stuck on the paper, there was no way to get them off.

But now I found these Sticker Solutions sticker books, they are awesome. My kids are having so much fun categorizing and sorting out their stickers on the correct pages, and now the stickers can be removed, and used again!

My kids also LOVE the cover of the books because the picture changes. Very cool idea!",5.0
"My kids have a lot of stickers that they collect from school and birthday parties.  We were looking for a book that would allow them to collect but reuse some of their stickers.  There are only a few stickers included within this book, but we were really looking for a collector's book/album with plenty of pages.  This was the best book that we have found with lots of colorful pages for them to place their stickers.  Other parents have seen this book and love the design.  Now, my boys and their friends are able to share their sticker collection with each other.  This is an excellent product!",5.0
"I purchased this book from his Etsy shop and I loooooooooove it.  It's hard to tell how big it actually is from looking at it online, but when I got it in person, I was surprised at the size.  It's massive.  The quality is great. Every picture is unique and quite different from the next. A lot of variety.  The images are extremely detailed, too, so if you like a challenge this book is definitely for you.  But even as a beginner colorist, I would recommend it.

Honestly, I would give this book six stars if Amazon would let me :-)",5.0
"This book is absolutely exquisite!
Everything about it is of superior quality - the HUGE sized pages/POSTERS, the heavy, smooth, brilliant white paper, sharp black lines, binding that allows easy removal of pages and the number of pages!
This is like a DOUBLE coloring book since each page is the size of two pages combined.
There is a wide range of subjects, all filled with precise details. You will get lost in the fantastic image while you color it!

UPDATE:  I have now purchased all 3 of Jess' coloring books - YES, they are THAT good!

"I purchased this Adult Coloring Book Variety Poster directly from their website, before it made available on Amazon.
I immediately drawn to how detailed and beautiful each page on this book. The themes varied that the hardest thing for me is to pick my favorite. From mermaid, farm, animals, fantasy, world and even beautiful ladies. This book is a must-have for anyone who loves beautiful line-art to color.",5.0
There are so many beautiful pages in this book. The pages are big so it will take me a while to finish them all. It features scenes from all around  the world and others from the artists imagination. I use both gel pens and colored pens. This book works well with both as the paper is heavy duty so the ink does not bleed through and each page is only printed on one side. Each page can be easily removed without ripping the page. They are held with glue on the edge. I bought a well known coloring book once and the pages were held with glue and string binding like a hardcover novel. It was very difficult to get the pages out of that book and some ended up ripping. Luckily I did not have any of the same difficulties with this book. I am able to remove the pages with ease so I can frame or hang with up. Everyone that loves coloring will love this book. I should get back to coloring I have lot's more to do.,5.0
I love the huge size of this book. The paper quality is great. It's easier to smear my gel pens while wet b4 the paper soaks it up.  The level of heart Jess has puts in his art is at a level that guides me to want to put more heart into my colorings.

"Wow, this is such an amazing book! I am so glad that I purchased it. Let me start out by saying that all of the posters in this book are huge! The paper quality is fantastic! Heavy duty card stock. There is a wonderful array of beautiful artwork to choose from. Absolutely something for everyone here. I had a wonderful time coloring this poster and am so pleased with how it came out that I am having it framed. Great job Jess Perna! You are a terrific artist. It is a pleasure to color your work!",5.0

I was surprised at how pricey these guides are but my life became much easier once I purchased them and could get an accurate color match for the files I create. It also ensures I can get printers to produce the exact color that I'm looking for.,5.0

"A must-have for any graphic designer who uses PMS to communicate with vendors/manufacturers or clients.....I had an old book given free to me from 2008 that didn't match my screen....finally, when upgrading to this new book and the Creative Cloud, I was immediately about to see almost the same color on my screen as in the book....",5.0
"A must have for graphic designers.
Just a note. Don't for get to download the Pantone Color manager so that you can export your new books/swatches to Adobe products or the like. There are instructions in the books on how to download the color manager. To export, update all books in the manager then go to file and export to your software. I thought Pantone would update with Adobe swatches automatically but they do not. You have to add the books manually. This was kinda a pain and a bit confusing so I thought I'd let others who are purchasing know.",5.0

"Perfect! I've been in the printing industry for 17 years and for the longest time had an old chart someone gave me. It was nice to see the updated version with good clean colors. One thing I truly like since they are not numeric there is a index chart in the back with the numbers and the page. I never had the index on my old one and sometimes if the pms numbers were not in order it was always hard to find the number. But with this index chart is is so easy. There was a comment the card stock was not a nice as the past and that is true the card stock is thinner but still workable. I am glad I broke down and bought a new one! I added the pic of the coated chart, the uncoated is seperate and comes with the coated",5.0

Very handy in dim-lighted situations such as airplanes, hotel rooms or travelling on a train.  I highly recommend it. Order it at Amazon.com along with its neat soft zippered holder.",5.0

"If you own the light wedge, this is a necessary item to protect it from dust, scratches, etc.",5.0
Unlike other booklights - this thing really only lights up the page of your book and not the whole room.  Reading in bed - or even just in a room without good lighting is so much easier than with the clip on style light.  Sure its more expensive - but sooo worth it.,5.0
I love that you can just lay the lightwedge over the Kindle and read with no trouble at all and the case keeps it clean and free of dust so it's ready to use whenever I need it.,5.0

"Very well made, fits LightWedge exactly and gives good protection against scratches, etc.  Keep in mind this is the case only, the LightWedge has to be bought separately.  LightWedge is excellent for reading in bed if your husband does not like light in the room when he is sleeping.",5.0

"I love my Kindle but I'm rather annoyed the covers/cases run anywhere from $30-$40 on average AND they add bulk to the slim design which takes up extra space in my handbag.

If you're looking for a great case at an excellent price for your Kindle, the LightWedge Paperback Soft Case is the case for you!",5.0
I've had my LightWedge for years and wish I'd bought this cover sooner. It opens completely to make it very easy to get the book light in and out. It fits the light perfectly without adding any extra bulk. It takes up almost no extra room than just the light itself. I highly recommend this cover to protect and transport your LightWedge.,5.0

I don't own a LightWedge.  I ordered this to slip over my Kindle in its leather cover (M-Edge in red) when I toss it in my purse.  I wanted extra protection and liked that it zipped closed completely.  It was on sale and the price was right so I thought I'd try it.  Perfect fit and I could not be happier!,5.0
I love my LightWedges and the case keeps the big one safe.,5.0
"Update: Revision - Lightwedge makes the Verso Clip on, so I do have a Light Wedge light ;-), just not the one for this bag.

******************************************

Let me preface this to say: I don't have the LightWedge Book Lights (in fact, I don't even know how they would work).

Even though I already have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-mCover-Leather-Folio-Cover-Case-for-Amazon-Kindle-3-Fits-6-Display-built-in-inner-pocket/dp/B004E8X6FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue mCover Leather Folio Cover Case for Amazon Kindle 3 (Fits 6"" Display, built-in inner pocket)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verso-Clip-On-Reading-Light-for-Kindle-Turquoise/dp/B003FZA1OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verso Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle (Turquoise)</a>, I was reading the Kindle Forums, and someone suggested this case as an added level of protection.

I followed the link, and placed it in my cart - waiting to compile a group of objects to qualify for Free Shipping :-)  (Note the Signature - Penny Pinching)

During this time, the LightWedge went into Save (claiming it was unavailable).  I found the counterpart for $3 more, another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LightWedge-Original-Soft-Case/dp/B0001MRGKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LightWedge Original Soft Case</a>.  No one is ever happy with a price increase, but I also noted the size difference (the one available was slightly larger, and may work for others whom have bigger Kindle cases).

So I said to myself - HHMMMM.  I placed the Larger One in my Wishlist, and waited.  A couple of days later, I clicked on the one still saved in cart, and voila - it was available (however, it did not move back into cart like it was supposed to, HHHHMMM).

Since I'd acquired enough items to Freely Ship, I placed my order on 11/12.  That little case was in my hands via UPS on 11/14 (still waiting for the REST of the order to ship, lol).

The case is beautiful and Perfect.  I'm glad I chose this size.  See my image above for differences from the product description and picture shown.  This must be a newer model, but works absolutely marvelous!!

The Kindle, Cover and Light fit in the Case with room to spare.  Since the MCover comes with a Pocket, I can place extra goodies in the Pocket.  For reading, I like to hinge the front cover to the back with the band, so anything in the pocket can go in the case for safe keeping (in a Coffee Shop, Reading on the Bus, etc.)

Now, for the REAL Penny Pinchers out there - you can take a clear bubble wrap envelope (I had saved one from an Amazon Shipment, and kept my Kindle in it while waiting for the Cover), and place the Envelope in the Case.  It will still fit (but the case AND LightWedge Cover offer better protection re bumps).  The case also helps to protect against dust and - gasp, CAT HAIR (I have 3 of those buggers).

As to the fabric, it is soft, feels like Velvet, and nice enough to use as its own purse (with the Kindle and goodies stuck inside).  You can also put it in a back pack, or roll in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whitmor-6342-2779-BLUE-Rolling-Utility-Cart/dp/B001UE8ILS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whitmor 6342-2779-BLUE Rolling Utility Cart</a>.  Dust and CAT HAIR easily brushes off the case.  For a quick run, this makes an excellent looking Tote Bag (watch out Gucci).  There is a slight smell (the same as describe with the MCover), waiting to see if it goes away with time.

Highly recommended for your Kindle Travel and Protection needs.  5 stars.",5.0
This was just what I needed to store my LightWedge while I am not using it.  I love to read at night so the LightWedge is the best booklight.  No that I have a Kindle I need to store the wedge on occasion.,5.0

This is a perfect case for my lightwedge. It is soft and zips all the way around so it is easy to get it in and out of. It is very well made and very lightweight. It protects the lightwedge when not using it and is perfect for traveling.  I just stash it with my book and off we go!,5.0
"I wanted a simple travel case to protect my Kindle, but I did not like the cost and bulk of most of the cases sold specifically as Kindle cases.  In searching for a simpler alternative, I came across this case, which is designed for the LightWedge booklight.  It fits the Kindle very nicely, providing protection against bumps and scratches.  It's very light weight, very simple, and much cheaper than most Kindle cases.  I know this isn't what it was designed for, but it works great for simple, cheap Kindle protection.",5.0
"I bought this to use as a protective travel pouch for my Kindle 2. My k2 with an Amazon or Noreve or Oberon cover fits perfectly. It provides a nice cushion of extra protection for the Kindle. Also, the photo on Amazon shows the ""Lightwedge"" logo on this pouch as white, but it is actually black & barely noticible, which is a plus for a logo-phobe like me!",5.0
These little zippered pouches are an fantastic way to protect your lightwedge when it isn't in use.,5.0
My wife's Kindle with an M-Edge cover fits securely inside of the lightwedge soft case.  She carries her Kindle with her everywhere in her purse and she states it is now protected in the case from any small particles which may become lodged between her Kindle and M-Edge cover. Nice quality for the price and she highly recommends!,5.0
Much safer and more bright than candles.  Works during hurricanes!  Also good for outdoors as a flashlight.  Must have when the electricity goes out.  Keep in the car when traveling at night.,5.0
"Got this to replace a fixed arm booklight that broke too easily and had a limited range of movement.  This one, with two flexible arms, is great.  Can use one or both lights and they move and bend to whatever angle you need, including being able to sit on my end table.  Have even used one arm to light the book and the other to peer into the dark to see where the cat was scratching.  Very compact and easy to pack up or store.  The on/off switch on the top of the light is easy to use and the light is powerful enough to light up both pages of a hardback book.  The base, however, is too heavy and bulky for paperback but I don't read them anyway.",5.0
"Works great, the best book light I ever owned!  It adjust well to use with Kindle.  Can be place and adjusted so there is no glare or reflection of the light on the kindle.  Love this light!",5.0
"I bought three of these in blue (a spare for me and one for my brother) after thoroughly reading all of the comments on competitive brands. I found the comments praising this model to be right on the mark. When I read it lit up both pages at the same time using dual lights where all other brands required constant repositioning for each page, that was all I needed to know this was the best reading light for me.

I can't say enough nice things about this product. It has dual lights on a flex shaft which you can position to fully illuminate both pages of a large hardback book. You won't need to keep moving the light around to light your pages with this one and the pages ar well lit for easy reading in the dark. But the light is centralized on the book and not the surrounding area so others can sleep while you read.

You can also switch from dual lights to a single light. The flexible shaft on the light is sturdy and stable enough to firmly hold its position over the book even while you move around and turn pages. You can either clip it on the cover or use the clip to hold open the pages. It operates on AAA batteries. The higher quality battery, the longer it lasts. I use the Duracell ultra digital batteries with the blue band.

I cannot think of any negatives about this product. I'm not associated with any seller. I am just a customer who was happy to find a great product. Definitely a good buy.",5.0

"I have purchased MANY book lights in the past, but never have I owned one that was actually bright enough to read by. I usually keep moving the light around and around and around so I can see the page .  I ordered the power adapter but it hasn't arrived yet, I am using 3 AAA batteries and this is a awesome light. It has 2 lights in the head you can use both or just one, the light spreads across both pages of a paperback in either mode one light or two, I haven't tried a hard cover book yet, but I really don't think this light will have any problem at all. Very Very Bright. I definitely recommend this light .",5.0

"My wife who loves to read in bed after I have gone to bed, has tried many, many book lights over the years. The complaints have been many about each one, and pretty much the same. Small circle of light, have to move it from side to side to see good. So last Christmas I went on an internet hunt for the ideal book light. After a few days of research, I decided on this one for her. Now 7 months later she wants me to buy one for our daughter, and a spare for her (in case I lose or break it) cause she says could not live a night without it now. True story. It is bright and evenly covers an area of two pages of a large book without trouble, no hot spots. Seems to be the perfect book light. Battery life is excellent with the LED bulbs.",5.0
"The company that manufactures this light is called Mighty Bright, and for good reason!  The lamp gives off more than enough light to read by in a pitch black room.  It has two brightness settings, one with both LEDs and another with just one.  The LEDs in this lamp are so bright, that only one is really needed, having two is an added bonus.  I'm not using a power adatpter, I'm running off of 3 AAA batteries.  LEDs use such a small amount of power, those batteries should last me a year or more.  Overall I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this light.  With such a fair price I didn't think it would really hold up, but I'm definitely going to recommend it.",5.0
"New technology has led to the book or craft light that will be the end to all others.

Its incredibly bright--with no shadows--, lights both pages (no shadows), is by far the brightest light (maybe double), spots only onto the book (the room remains dark), completely flexable shaft so you can direct the light exactly on what you want, AND lasts 40 hours on 3 AAA batterys!

"I am very happy with this thoughtfully designed book light. The plastic clip is a little bulky as its base houses the batteries (two AAA) but it offers good tension and does stay in place. When reading at night in bed (laying on my side) I clip the light onto the back cover of my book near the center of the book at the spine/binding. If it's not a hardback I just include several pages at the back of book along with the cover in the clip and the clip stays in place. The light is very bright and lights both open pages. The lamp head is easily adjusted and stays where I put it. Because I often fall asleep while reading, the auto shut-off option/feature was very important. It blinks a '1-minute warning' so if I am awake I can add more reading time simply by pressing a small button on back of lamp head -- 1 click for each additional 15 minute up to 3 clicks/45 min. A small light is illuminated for each click so at a glance I can see how much 'timer-time"" there is. The timer is an option, and the light can be turned on/off using similar button switch on lamp head. There is also a master off/on switch on the clip (where the batteries are located.)",5.0
Nice product. Recommended,5.0
"I did not expect this small light to be so bright. It's easy to use, works on my nook simple touch, paperbacks, and hardcovers. I have trouble seeing at night, and even when this is the only light I use, I can read easily. Both settings are equally bright, so if you're looking for a really bright book light, this works.",5.0

I used to read a lot on bed at night but after marriage I kind of stopped doing that as my hubby couldn't sleep with the loghts. Then I bought this and it is perfect. The light is only on the book and doesn't bother him at all. The light is bright enough for me to read too. I'm loving it. I already gifted this to a couple of my friends,5.0
Fantastic light. It's nice and bright with two different settings. Does a great job of immuminating the book. I've even used it to crosss tit h. Worked great for that too,5.0
"The light is great.  I have found it has great coverage, a great light, a very handy feature that turns one light off but keeps the other on to dim the brightness (good at night while the wife is asleep), and includes batteries.  As long as it last a while it will be well worth the money.",5.0
Gives off more light and is sturdier than I expected. Does what I hoped it would do.,5.0
"I bought these so my kids can read at bedtime without fights over when it's time to turn out the lights.  There is a master switch on the main body of the lamp, and a timer switch on the light head.

Pros: The timer is easy to set - you simply push the button and it cycles from off to 1, 2, 3, or 4 red lights showing - each light indicates a 15 minute interval.  My kids can easily set it and tell how long it is set for.

General info: It takes 3 AAA batteries (included).  The battery compartment is easy to open by pushing the small black button on the bottom of the light.

All in all it's a great light and I plan to get an extra one for myself so I don't waste batteries when I fall asleep over my book at night.",5.0
"We use this amazing light above our desks.  We love the way we can move it around to shine on the paperwork we are working on.  I originally bought it for myself, then my husband wanted one too.  We have old eyes so the Mighty Bright light makes it easy to get our work done in our office...",5.0

Great reading light.,5.0
"I've had this since 2011 and used it for many unexpected things. Of course, it's great as a book light for my Kindle, although I don't read in the dark much any more. It used to live on the bookcase to use like a flashlight finding CD's or book titles. I used it with a magnifying glass for coin collecting.  I used it when cleaning the dog's ears. He'd lay on his side on the couch, and I'd clip the light to the edge of the afghan and direct it so I could see. (A couple years ago, my wife gave me a head lamp that works even better.) More recently, I clip it to the toilet seat to illuminate the target during those nocturnal visits, improving aim without blinding me with bathroom lights.

I'm very impressed with the build quality of this light. It works as well now as when new. I truly love proven durability. Batteries last a long time because LED's use so little power. I really haven't used the optional plug-in power adapter because portability is key. The goose neck is still sturdy and the switch still works. The rubberized grip pads have stayed unpetrified and spring tension is still good.",5.0

"Works perfectly. It creates a beam of light that lights up the book just right and not the room.

"Perfect little book light.  Big enough to provide good light (two settings), but small enough so it stays put on your book.  Use it a lot, and it's held up well.

I bought this little guy so I could read actual physical books in bed without waking my mate. Two brightness settings; bendy neck; and lightweight: You-know-who immediately claimed it.

I ordered the Mighty Bright after breaking the clip off of my 7-year old Mighty Bright that was still going strong.  The product is durable and I suspect that the plastic clip had become brittle with age.  It has served me well and has traveled the world with me.  The original item still illuminates well.  This is the most practical private lighting fixture on the market.  I like having the ability to determine the strength of light.  I can use either one bulb or both with one click.,5.0
Works well,5.0
"I love these book lights.  I bought some in pink and blue for my kids and came back and bought another for myself.  They are very easy to use.

Bad purchase",1.0
This heater leaked internally  right after install.  Directions are incomplete- nothing on how the built in computer control works,1.0
I ordered this unit IR260 and was unable to install it for about. a month because I needed to install the electric to the area where I was using it . The unit did what I wanted it to do for about 3 to 4 months and stoped heating the water. I contacted the manufacturer and they said to contact the seller to get it replaced for free. When I contacted them they gave me the runaround I asked to speak to a technician  they said he would call me that day. Later that day the phone rang with that same number but when I picked up on the first ring no answer. This is not the type of seller Amazon needs.,1.0
"i installed this 10 months ago, instructions were easy and it worked well. this week, the water heater is stuck on 26/27. i tried all the different modes from 1-4, reset my circuit breakers, no changes. it won't heat water anymore.

UPDATE 1-20-18

Their warranty requires you to have a licensed installer. But that isn't my complaint. Its their useless service that renders the most possible difficulty and monetary gain on the company that disturbs me. I actually dropped off my heater to get fixed when this company was named SuperGreen, seems they changed names. Their supposed heating element that lasts 20 years was broken in 10 months. When I tried to pick it up, they made it as difficult for me to pick up as possible after 5pm at the worst traffic. They are never in the office, but if you show up they will try to make a show that they are working hard. If you call them its some VOIP callback system with really bad sound quality, the baby crying in the background gives it away pretty quickly. This product seems like some kind of repackaged Alibaba heater, as the Celsius reading is obviously not made for the USA market.

Rather than jump through their hoops to pick up my repaired heater, I just left it there because I figured it will save me more problems down the road and I really don't want to deal with their bad service anymore. I bought another company's water heater, installed it myself. Didn't require any contractor to install it and the warranty is good. The new water heater readings are in F, not C.  The Supergreen/SioGreen dial adjusting inlet where you have to manually turn wasn't required, my new water heater just worked. Less headache, more hot water. That's all I wanted, and I got it with another manufacturer.",1.0
"What can I say it broke, and forgot the warranty to send it in. So I have to pay lots of money on shipping and repair. Not going to happen.",1.0

I loved these when i first got them and have been using them non-stop. As a designer you need these! The brad that holds the swatch book together came apart and it's only been a month.

Now i have to carry it around in a plastic bag! real professional right?,1.0
Piece of crap.  Fell apart right out of the box.  For over $100 you'd think they would have chosen a better quality piece of plastic (or maybe metal instead) to bind the swatch cards together.  Very disappointed with Pantone.,1.0

Terrible customer service and does not match description.",1.0
"I am a creative artist for a garment decoration business and Pantone books are a must-have.  But shame on you Pantone.  We pay a lot of money for these guides, but your latest books are made from cheap, flimsy paper which folds, bends and tears easily.  Colors are NOT in numerical order, which may be fine if you're just trying to eyeball tonal values, or if you are an art student, but very frustrating to professionals who need to look up a certain PMS number quickly and without a lot of hassle.  It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  I know you provided an index for color numbers in the back of the book...an index, really?!  I should be able to go right to the color, not have to look it up in an index.

I noticed that you no longer have customer reviews available on your website.  I am guessing that this is because of the hundreds and hundreds of negative reviews I read there while you still had it on your site.  Please Pantone, go back to the thick stock paper, with PMS colors in numerical order.

You poor souls reading this review, well, you are stuck with what they sell now.  I contacted Pantone and they do not sell older versions of their books.  Good luck.",1.0
"After using pantones for the last 10 yrs this is by far THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT !.

- the Stock is light and will not stand a commercial environment for any length of time.  We use these books to work with !

- The numbers of reference make no sense at all.  most people use numbers to reference in a consecutive manner. pantone was on acid when they designed this as it is just a jumbled mess with no rationale at all.

If this is this company moving forward with a new product their days are numbered and i will certainly not be buying another product from them.

RIDICULOUS !!!

It is so flimsy I'm afraid to look for a color because I'm afraid I'm going to tear the book. The order is new and if your used to the old way you won't like it either. My number one reason to not get it is the stock. I called Pantone today because they came out with a new book called Designer Field Guide. I thought ""maybe they listened and made thicker stock!"". Nope. Same stock. I told him I refuse to buy a new book until they change the stock.",1.0

"Update:
All are now dead. I took a chance on ""Mighty Bright 47017 Recharge Book Light""
 mostly because it's head and neck are a continuous flexible  silicon piece.
The good:
No spinning head problem - easily adjustable - seems to have long battery life - much better made than my last mighty bright 40513

The not so good:
Neck is a bit short - another inch or so would have been much better.
The clip is small - It's been fine for paper backs and medium hard covers not sure it would work for text books or a kindle.
About twice the price - (but if it last will actually save cash)

=====================================
The Good
I really liked this light - the goose neck allows you to move it about with ease and it stays where you put it...doesn't sag like my old ""hinged"" reading light did
Light is BRIGHT yet doesn't seem to spill further than my book
Clamp works on both paper backs and hard covers
The BAD:
the first one (2012)  I bought ended up with a HEAD (the part where the bulbs are) that was so loose it spun about....that was after about a year...eventually I got sick of that and ordered another, just this past Sept (2015)....the plastic was much cheaper looking and the color less to my liking (got purple both times) but the WORST part was the on/off button stopped working after about 3 months :
AND the battery compartment cover Always popped off

I am debating if the third time will be the charm - or if I need to look elsewhere

 I checked out the return policy and it is 30 days only ...so I am stuck with it. Really unhappy there is no recourse after 30 days as I would have ordered a replacement.
So the message is - test it thoroughly when you receive it !",1.0
"When you first turn this on, you think to yourself this is great.  But after about 4-5 minutes you can't even tell its on.  Just a faint glow.  The length of the arm is really too short to be useful if you can't type it to your reader.",1.0
"This is a very soft white low light. Too soft and its not even close to a might bright, they advertise. Its way too low of a light to read by.",1.0
"I loved the idea of this item.  It clips onto a surface and provides reading light over a book.  It worked well for a a while but then the batteries needed replacing. We replaced the batteries and it didn't work.  We replaced them again with a new set of fresh batteries and it still didn't work.  I threw it out.  I would not purchase this product again, obviously.",1.0
It lasted only for two weeks. Not a good product. Total waste.of money.,1.0
"What a waste, not bright enough or big enough to be useful.  Like a using a magnifying glass as it does not illuminate the whole page",1.0
"Did NOT last the month.  I don't want to have to replace a battery every month, and my daughter was only reading an hour a night.",1.0
Not happy. Had one just like this and it was great. Light keeps flickering and it drives me crazy.  Can't use it.,1.0
Barely a light,1.0
"Xtraflex 2 Led Book 1. ""Cheesy""  light"". Caritas7",1.0
Switcher was broken after few days,1.0
Thought this was going to be a nice purpose.  But upon opening the box and using it the first day the on/off button fell off. Sent it back for a full refund.,1.0
"I do not recommend this product, I bought the purple one, and after three weeks of been using it ( not in daily bases). Its stem was too loose. The next day it was completely hanging down. It is not way to tie it up. Therefore, I cannot use it. Unfortunately I discharged the Book light's box some days after I receive it ( do not make the same mistake). And, I am unable to return it.",1.0
"I bought 2 of these, and they give off good light for a few minutes and then fade very quickly to almost nothing.  Very disappointed and I have no idea how there are so many positive reviews.",1.0
Broke the first time I replaced the batteries. Lasted less than a year. Completely disappointing.,1.0
Not bright enough for studying. maybe convenient to casually read in bed but definitely not for studying. It makes you sleepy.,1.0
The LED lights have stopped working not even a month into my purchase. The lights are so dim you could hardly tell the lamp was even on. This is  one of the worst things i have bought from amazon.,1.0
Excellent product!,1.0
stopped working soon after I got it,1.0
Stopped working soon.  New batteries didn't help.  It dims so badly that it is useless,1.0
"Horrible. Broke within a week. All of a sudden it won't turn on even after putting brand new batteries in. If I could give this product zero stars, I would.",1.0
Ugly. Big and klunky. Not discreet at all.,1.0
"I swapped out the worthless cheap batteries that came with it, replacing them with brand-new Energizers. It worked well for about 8 hours of use. Since then, it produces adequate light for several minutes after turning it on, then the light dims to the point of being useless.",1.0
It''s not bright enough to be worth anything for reading purposes. It might work as a night light to keep from running into a wall.,1.0
Product is not worth ordering. I would return but I am not certain if I have the paperwork. The light gave off a bright light suitable for reading for the first week. Then suddenly it puts out only a very low light. Useless!!,1.0
the bulbs burned out within 6 weeks.  Other than that it was nice.,1.0
switch does not turn on off consistently,1.0
Had to send it back because it didn't work right.,1.0
"Let there not be light?  This tiny lamp is very bright when you first turn it on.  It goes dim after a short time, and if you are reading you need a bright light that lasts for the length of the book, not just a short chapter.  It's not sturdy and topples over easily.  It's too much bother to return.  I bought an electric standing lamp that plugs into the wall, works great and finally I can read with no eye strain.  Save your money and forget about this.",1.0
"This is a serious piece of junk. Not only did it stop working after less than a month of use, the battery compartment started leaking out all over the unit. Stay away from anything this company makes.",1.0
Both lights I ordered began flickering within 2 months (of limited use) and are now useless.,1.0
Didn't last long now broken,1.0
Ordered this Mighty Bright from DssK and received a knock-off from Singapore that took almost a month to arrive. Was in a plain unlabeled box. It has a different style clip than pictured and no Mighty Bright logo. The light works fine in battery mode but the USB power cord does not fit into the lamp body very well causing the lamp to go out if moved at all when plugged in. Attempted to contact DssK through Amazon and they never replied.,1.0
I thought it was brighter,1.0
"I bought this light 3 months ago.  The button that turns the light on and off has stopped working so now I have to take the batteries out to turn it off--what a cheap piece of $HIT.

Stay clear of this $HITTY, Made in China light that looks good but is NOT  a quality product.",1.0
"The light I got was an apparent Chinese knock off, it was in a plain white box and is poorly constructed.",1.0
This was not the original Mighty Bright t thought I was buying. Mailed from someone in China. Not very sturdy.,1.0
The lighting is too weak. It barely brightens.,1.0
This light is just not bright enough and is made with that cheap Chinese quality that we've all come to expect. Our daughter doesn't even use it anymore. Keep looking!,1.0
"Horrible! Defective product, I never even got to use this lamp once. Soon as I put brand new batteries in the whole thing overheated......waste of money!",1.0
"Shortly after I received it, it stopped working. Amazon is having it replaced.",1.0
Junk- did not work well... Do not waste your money...sorry Amazon....,1.0
Beware!  What I received was not a Mighty Bright light.  It was a knock off that was mailed from China. I already have 2 Mighty Bright lights already (which I love).  The one I received is a bad knockoff.  I am in the process of trying to get my money back.  Buy only from Amazon.,1.0
"Battery cover came off within a few minutes... the light was floppin' around every where, which is very irritating when you just want to read in peace next to your husband without waking him... instead it was a gosh dang disco dance floor in bed. Thanks Xtraflex2 for ruining my marriage.",1.0
The light is temperamental. It only works when it wants to. Replaced the batteries multiple times & still will only power on half the time.,1.0
"I just received it. Why  one star? Well, the main reason I purchased was because after comparing price to others, I figured it was a good deal since description said ""3AAA batteries included""... well you guessed it, the batteries are NOT included. False advertising. Soooooo can't tell you if it works or not since I really didn't purchase with the intentions of plugging it in a wall socket. That's why I have a lamp. Very disappointing.",1.0
This light started out just great.  I got it about 2 months ago.  Now when I turn it on it is very bright for about 10 minutes then it dims and is not very bright at all.  I don't know if I just got a bad one but now it says I can't return it.  I have had it too long - 2 months - that is disappointing.  I bought due to all the good reviews.,1.0
"I didn't get 15 hours of use out of my light. Went dead; I tried 3 separate sets of brand new batteries. Nothing. Waste of money. And the on-off switch being in top of light, every time you adjust the arm, you hit the switch. Poor engineering.",1.0
The item arrived fast but it's not working properly.,1.0
Did not include the 3 triple-A batteries that were promised.,1.0
"Defective.  Flickered on and off the first time I used it.

This brand has a great reputation but is tough to find in stores.  Either I got a complete dud (which is possible) or this is not a genuine product that someone is trying to pass off as real to amazon distributors.  I'm very suspicious.",1.0
It' not working,1.0
"The stem of this light is not like the older model in that it will not stay in the position in which you set it, something to do, I imagine, with the construction of the stem that runs from the battery housing to the lamp itself.  Thus, it is near impossible to light the exact area you wish most to illuminate.  The manufacturer has clearly cut cost with materials and it shows.  If you want to light up the area just to the left of where you actually need the illumination, this might be the product for you.  Very frustrating.",1.0
"I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. This is a flimsy, cheaply designed problem that stopped working after a few days of normal use. I would not recommend it to a friend.",1.0
Too awkward.  Turning pages is too noisy,1.0
Broke within a day of use. Light will not turn on/off anymore. Sorry but cannot recommend this product.,1.0
"I got this as a birthday gift to my wife, and it worked great for the first 2 hours. Then the thing wouldn't turn off. In the middle of the night, to get the light off, I pulled the battery. Now the thing won't turn on (yes the battery is back in). I suspect that the problem is in the switch, maybe a lemon, or maybe its just a piece of junk. Eitherway, its junk to me now.
I'd return it if I could, but apparently since it spent 3 weeks wrapped up, I have missed the window, and now cant be returned. My only option now is to dismantle the thing and hope to fix it. MONEY WASTED.",1.0
Not enough light.  I am so sorry I listened to the reviews and purchased this light.  It is just not enough light to read by.  I did give it a try several times but I had to keep changing the position of the light attached to the  book cover.  I would have sent it back but didn't want to start up with the packing and the shipping.  Down the road I gave this concept of attached a small light to the book another try with TWO lights on the product.  That one was not as bright as this one and I got eyestrain and dizzy after trying to use it.  There are LED lights out there that are larger and stand on my headboard but have flexible stems that can be turned away from the other side of the bed.. I use one of those and it is not that much more $$.  Please don't waste your money on this item.,1.0
"The base is way too bulky, to the point that it's pretty much useless to use with a paperback book. You have to clip a big chunk of pages in order for the book to be able to hold it but even then, it will still rock to the side and requires constant babysitting.

If that wasn't bad enough, now I can't even get it to turn off. It is supposed to have 3 modes, bright (both lights on) regular (one light on) and off. Well after using a grand total of 3 whole times, mine will only switch between one light or two lights on, it won't turn off. I have to pull the batteries out to turn it off. It's turned into way too big of an inconvenience for me to keep this. I'm returning it and getting something else.",1.0
"We purchased two of these November 19th, 2013 for or 7 and 5 year olds to use as reading lights before bed.  Worked well at first.  Then my youngest was moving his lite and told me it was hot.  I checked the lite and at the base of the black cord where the cord enters into the battery pack the black cord was Very hot.  I immediately removed the batteries and did not detect anything.  Put batteries back in, the lite came on and had the same effect.  I have now removed from there room.

We did not have a similar issue with the other that we could tell, but we found blue paint on our son's bed where the lite was clipped. Again upon inspecting the lite, the paint was liquifying (?) and rubbing off the lite.  I removed this lite as well.

Long story short, I would not recommend and certainly would not provide to a child as there is clearly something going on in the quality of the mfg.  Amazon I recommend you investigate as I certainly would not want my children around products like this...",1.0
Love this double bulbed lite for reading books & magazines.,1.0
"tiny tiny tiny, and the light is very very dim. it is probably only useful if you clip this on your big book directly, if it's placed on a nightstand or a desk, because it's so short and light is so dim, it's hardly useful.",1.0
"i guess it's not a good sign when something doesn't work out of the box.
not worth my time to return.
they should pay ME for saddling me with this piece of garbage.",1.0
"Batteries lasted maybe a week.  Never again. This is a poorly contructed item that at best gave out a 5"" light.",1.0
This is not a commentary on the product itself. I am giving one star because the product is described as using small lithium batteries when instead it uses AAA batteries. For space reasons this was important to me.,1.0
did not work when I got it right away.  had to send it back immediately.  It is junk - spend a little more money on something else.,1.0
"The first one kept going off Put in new batteries same problem then quit working at all, second one worked for 30 min then the light started getting weaker and weaker. Not for me.",1.0
I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN. USED LIMITED BASIS FOR NIGHT READING AND GETTING AROUND THE HOUSE IN THE DARK WITHOUT WAKING THE FAMILY UP. I THOUGHT LEDS LASTED A LONG TIME. THIS ONE NOT SO MUCH. IT DOES HAVE A NICE DESIGN BUT I ENDED UP DONATING MINE AFTER IT CRASHED IN MONTH AND CHANGING THE BATTERIES DID NOT HELP. OH WELL. LESSON LEARNED.,1.0
"Sadly I was only able to use this book light a few times before the clamp stopped ""clamping"". The spring underneath appears to be intact, but when I press the clamp to open it and clamp it took my book it won't close again, just loosely swings back and forth. Worked perfectly fine last night. What a disappointment!!! I'm not sure I can even return it bc of Amazon.coms very tight return policy. Also the name ""Mighty Bright"" is very fitting. This light is WAY TOO BRIGHT!",1.0
"Bought this hoping that it would be the perfect light for reading in bed next to my husband while he sleeps, but it is way too bright, even with only one bulb lit.  I tried putting a thin sock over it to dim the light but then I had another problem.  A tiny part of the bulb continued to glow even after I turned everything off.  I had to remove a battery to get it to turn off completely. The clamp is way too big/bulky even for mid-size paperbacks.  Disappointed and money wasted.",1.0
This broke almost immediately - both the bulb and the bendable neck. The clip is also not able to grab on to things that are thicker than a book cover (hard cover). I was hoping my son could clip it onto his headboard but it didn't work.,1.0
This is not what I thought it would be. The clip does not hold sturdy onto any book and the arm does not steadily hold the light in one place where I set it. I would not recommend this.,1.0
The item was dead on arrival. The package was partially open. The head housing the light was loose and the someone had tried to open it. The screw holding the housing together had groove marks and scratches near it. It was definitely not new. Returned for refund.,1.0
"I purchased this as a stocking stuffer and gathered all items together last night. I took the light out of the packaging and tried it, which normally I would not do (take it out of the package).  The light does not work at all. Because I ordered the light and did not check it right away, I missed the date of return limit. I am not pleased. Faulty product but I am paying the price.",1.0
"The product description says power source is PLUG-IN.
It is not, it is battery operated.  Had I known this, I would not have bought it.
Other similar lights like this one are only $9.00.",1.0
"I have purchased two Mighty Bright Book lights in the last two years. The battery compartment must overheat, because the batteries in both lights began to corrode and leak after only a few months. I couldn't open the battery compartment of the first Mighty Bright because the batteries had leaked and corroded inside the casing. Last night while I was reading, battery acid began leaking from the battery compartment of the book light and the stuff got on my hands and face and started burning! These were not old lights -- I bought the most recent one about 6 months ago. I don't recommend this product and suggest that Amazon stop selling it.",1.0
"It appears they (China) makes a single light model because that is what I got.  The ad clearly says 2-light, but there is only one bulb and one setting, on or off. It does seem bright enough for me to read by, so I'll keep it and hope it doesn't have all the problems others have had with the two light model.

As an aside, This kind of thing is getting more common in the last year, not getting what I ordered. Some orders are hundreds of dollars and have always been fine, but in the last couple of months I have received wrong parts that the dealer clearly knew was not what was advertised. To Amazon's credit, they have always made things right in the end, but it is still a hassle for the buyer",1.0
"I received this in the mail a few days ago, the first night I plugged it in it worked.  I went to use it the next day and the light would not come on.  I tried other pluggs to see if it was because of extension cord. Nothing, I read the reviews on here and they were mixed but a product should not stop working in a day. I would not recommend this because in my opinion it is defected.",1.0
"I was so excited to open this product.  Immediately I plugged it in (so it would ""charge"") and waited until the next night to try it.  Hmmm...unplugged it...it didn't work.  Plugged it in (has an approx 6' cord) it works.  Hmmm...read the instructions.  Takes 3 AAA batteries...cool....""Remove batteries when the reader's light is not in use.""  Are you kidding me???  Every time I want to use this, unless it is plugged in (I wanted something that didn't have to be plugged in while I used it) I need to put batteries in it...and when ""done"" need to take batteries out?  I paid $25 bucks for this.  My daughter-in-law got her book light for about $10 bucks at Target.  She doesn't have to take her batteries out when her book light is not in use.  Now if putting batteries in and taking them out doesn't annoy you or you don't mind dealing with the cord--I'd rate it a 4, but for me...it's a 1.  Jan in Portland, OR",1.0
"It was so big and cumbersome I just decided to mail it back without even opening it. These lights are supposed to be handy and not  bulky--why not just use a regular lamp instead, if not?",1.0
"It would have been a great light if it lasted. Hardly used it and went to turn it on and nothing. Always plugged in but changed batteries and still nothing. So, yes, I hate it.",1.0
great little light except that it is too bright to use. i will keep it and use for a car light since my interior car light is out---but too bright for a reading light,1.0
"I loved the design of this book light but the first time I used it, after about 5 minutes one of the lightbulbs started to flicker and has continued.  It is very distracting when you are using it to read.",1.0
"The light is not that light, but OK it's small.  The problem is that IT DOESN'T WORK!  The light worked for approx.  2 hours.  I changed the batteries, but nothing!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!",1.0
I'm not sure if this is an unusual occurrence but the light I received has a constant flutter in the light with three brand new batteries and is unusable for nighttime reading. I will be returning this product.,1.0
"This item worked very well when I first opened the package. Unfortunately I have only had it a couple of months and never really used it and the first time I wanted to do some midnight reading, it didn't work. What good is it if the battery goes so quickly? I mean, I NEVER used it once. How disappointing!",1.0
"it worked great when I first plugged it in, then one LED went out. I turned it off and the next day when I tried to turn it on it didn't turn on at all.",1.0
"This light is way over rated. It comes with no batteries, a somewhat bright light, and I could not recomment this to my friends.",1.0
"This light is great when it first comes on its bright, but after only a few minutes it starts to go dim.  I use it for my work to be able to see my papers I type from easier but after a few minutes it really is bad.  I guess its time to find me a brighter one that does bright.",1.0
I ordered two of these and both just arrived with defective switches.  One light does not keep burning once turned on.  The other light cannot be switched OFF and the switch is out of position. I have a Mighty Bright that is about 6 years old and still works but is not an LED.  The old one is of much more quality construction.  I am sending both of these back.  Save your time and money.  JUNK!!!,1.0
The light is great but only work a couple days. What a waste. Have to start looking for a replacement.,1.0
"I received this product and went to use it with brand new batteries and and the AC adaptor, but it did not work. This is the worst product I have bought online.",1.0
"It would have been nice to receive what is advertised, a 'Mighty Bright Xtra Flex2"" light. What came is a very cheap imitation, straight off the boat in a cheaply packaged box. Not what I paid for, Im returning it and buying direct from the Might Bright web site.",1.0
"I bought this lamp with high hopes for my wife. She loves the size and the brightness, but it's been flickering since we bought it. The flickering is, unfortunately, quite annoying and makes it hard to use.",1.0
"This little light is 1) uncomfortable, it won't stay in position but worse than all, it's 2) NOT BRIGHT!
when you light it it's nice and bright for about a minute, but then it dims and it barely lightens what you're reading. I have to use my night table lamp anyway for reading, even if i have this little thing on. I would return it but i took a while from when i bought it until i actually started using it, so it was too late. I know I would not recommend it and definitely won't buy again. sorry Mighty bright!",1.0
"It is bright at the beginning, but after a few months of use, this light becomes very dim and barely usable. Very disappointing product.",1.0
I know there are only a couple of other reviews where that was a problem... but still a real bummer.,1.0
"This may be enough light if you attach it to the item you're reading, assuming its not a thick book, and the light is 6-8"" from the reading surface.  But then its a hassle every time you want to turn the page.  Its too dim for me at 18-24"" inches from the reading surface, for example, attached it to a bed board behind you.  The LED light is very bluish.",1.0
It produced a nice reading light for one day.  The next day the light wouldn't work.  I thought it was the batteries.  I put 3 new ones in today and it still doesn't work.,1.0
"this does not fit at all on the m-edge leather case i just don't know where to clip it on.
and it's very heavy to use and im not comfortable reading with this light on bed since i usually clip it on the middle portion the folding part of the leather case not on the kindle unit so it's kinda heavy and need some effort to hold your kindle.
i had a hard time using this for my kindle touch reason i ordered another brand fitted for my m-edge leather.
i was trying to save a little, but rather ended up paying for more....",1.0
"The first one of these I got didn't work at all so I returned it and go another.  It worked when I got it, but then the first time the power in my house went out and I tried to use it, it didn't work at all.  And yes, I put in a new set of batteries.

Book lights never seem to last long, but this one sets a record for shortest period of time not working.  Fulcrum makes a better reading light.",1.0
"My original review said: Design makes it easy to travel with or store, and it has worked flawlessly for me. I would definitely recommend it.

Then the button stopped working, and I couldn't turn it on or off (except by removing the batteries) or change the dimness. So, Amazon will give me a partial refund when I send it back, but if the company that sold this product to me wants to replace my broken light, I'd be happy to send it back and get one that works.",1.0
"While there are plenty of positive reviews for this thing, make sure you check all the negative reviews as well.  For 11 bucks, I guess I didn't expect much, but it came so close to being good that it made it more disappointing to see it fail.

As others noted, yes, it is bright.  The clip worked fine for me on the book I'm trying it on.  However, it flickers so much as to be really distracting.  You know how in some houses the lights go up and down a bit when the central a/c comes on?  That's this thing, the whole time, and right on top of your reading.  Pretty disappointed, and I'll probably look for another solution.",1.0
"I purchased a kindle book light from Amazon 4 days ago. This is the type that plugs in so no batteries to replace. After one day of use the on/off switch no longer works,  sending this turkey back.",1.0
"This is not a travel light - unless you want to be hauling around with you a ""portable"" light that is about as big as a small paperback. Amazon description is awful. This is NOT what you want if you're looking for discrete, small, lightweight light. It's heavier than an e-reader! Ugh! I would return but the return shipping cost is half the price.",1.0
"I barely used this light. It might have been for the length of a total of 2 hours and it flickered, then there was this a burning smell. The light suddenly dimmed, and I'm hardly able to use it to read in the dark now. I bought it from a local bookstore so I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get refunded for this horrible light... I'll have to check the warranty to see if I can get a new one or get refunded from Mighty Bright. It really is too bad since I wanted to like this light since it had the option of using an AC adapter.",1.0
"Well it worked for a while for my wife. She used frequently, not sure how many hours of use though. Then switch started shorting out. 15-20 taps to turn on, then 15-20 taps to turn off. Light still works, but they should use a more reliable switch in next version.",1.0
Ordered a new reader light with the adapter.  The adapter what the specific reason for ordering it.  Came with NO packaging and no adapter!  Extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to this little item.  Returning this within 30 minutes of receiving it.  Never had this happen to me on an amazon fulfilled order.  Amazon should dump this seller immediately.,1.0
"I bought this, thinking it was kinda high, but really needing a book light, that I didn't need to always have batteries for.  I used it it was great.  The next time I used it was a week later, and that night it wouldn't work.  I tried it with batteries and a different adaptor cord after that.  It still didn't work.  I threw it out.",1.0
"The light worked for almost a month to the day and then the on/off button stopped working properly. It would turn on sometimes and not others; other times it would not turn off - I would have to remove the batteries. The product cannot be exchanged for a new one, refund is the only return option, but considering the price of the product and how much it would cost to send it back, it doesn't make much sense to do so. I basically rented a booklight for a month for $15.",1.0
"It may have been a dud--but the light I received did not work for very long, even after I switched the battery. It gave out strong light for a few minutes, then slowly flickered, then died. I replaced the battery again, to no avail.",1.0
"liked the light very much, and just threw the paperwork out the other day.... this morning light switch came off in my hand.... not repairable.... have had less than a month",1.0
"I was so excited to buy this light because of the positive reviews it got, I probably should have read the 1 star reviews because it would have saved me from buying it, I got this light on August 13, 2011 and the light stopped working on Oct 1, 2011, I am beyond mad, I turned my light on last night to begin reading and it made this noise like the bulb in the light went out and I was like OK maybe I need to replace the batteries (even though I JUST recently changed the batteries a few weeks ago) tried turning it on and NOTHING, wow what a rip off....",1.0
"I really hate to say ""I hate it"" But from the fisrt day I received it it flickered so I did report this to Amazon
and they did refunded my money.
So thank you
Sharon Traina",1.0
"I am thoroughly irritated. I bought this light, and immediately after receiving the package, I opened it up, put the batteries in, and turned it on to make sure it worked. Light wasn't as bright as I had hoped, but whatever, I figured I'd deal with it. Played around with the different light settings, then turned it off and left it on a table. The light was probably on for a minute total. Then I got busy for a few days and didn't use it, and now - 5 days after receiving it - I sat down to read and tried to use it, and it wouldn't turn on. Tried other batteries, still wouldn't turn on. Bottomline: A useless, junky light with very little brightness, if you can even get it to work. Definitely returning it.",1.0
It fits nicely on my Kindle cover but has flickered annoyingly from day one even though the battery is new.  Very disappointing.,1.0
I purchased this to use with my Sony Pocket Edition E-reader. It does not fasten onto it. I will have to be returning it.,1.0
"The light is too bright, even on the lower setting. My boyfriend can't fall asleep next to me when I have it on. An LED reading light is not necessary, I'll look for one that has a regular light, or an even lower light setting.",1.0
"Purchased in Jan 2011, dead by the end of March. Good Flexibly but no light no matter how I positioned it on my kindle. The 2 light brightness settings became inoperative. Waste of money. Surprised that this product failed with very little usage. Changed batteries 3 times light comes on until you release the button, the light goes out. This product is not worth your time let alone your hard earned money. A ""none of the above"" category would be closer to the truth as concerns this item. The lack of real a warranty from the manufacturer of this product isn't surprising!",1.0
"The batteries on the light don't last more than 2-3 hours.  I suspect something is wrong with the off switch, it keeps sucking power even when off.  Anyway, have not been able to use it much due to poor battery life.  Tried various batteries, none worked.",1.0
This light is very poorly made and I'd skip buying one. It broke the second time I used it. The light gets stuck on and won't shut off. I have to remove the batteries in order to shut off the light. It's being returned.,1.0
"I'd like to point out that the option suggested below the product which says that customer's often buy these items together, is very incorrect. The light bulbs shown, are not for the lamp being sold.  This was confirmed by the seller by phone. Please avoid making the same mistake I did in ordering what I assumed would be replacement bulbs for the lamp being sold.",1.0
"I ordered one of these book lights and it seemed to work really well right out of the box, however the very next day one of the bulbs would not turn on at all. So I thought maybe it needed new batteries, but after replacing the batteries there was no change. Then the light stopped working altogether. It now turns on only intermittently and flickers (still only one bulb). Unfortunately I threw away the package immediately after receiving it, don't make that mistake, and now I cannot return it without the package. Also I purchased it from an outside seller that was fulfilled through amazon, so I don't even have the option to exchange it. That is poor customer service on Amazon's part.

Don't waste your money on this overpriced book light. The quality of the workmanship is poor.",1.0
"Let me say that I wish this thing worked. I'll get to that in a minute.

First, Design-wise. 1. The clip. It clips well, even to a paperback, so long as you clip some pages in with the cover. 2. The flex-arm. Seems to be flexible enough to angle the light whichever direction you'd like. Great. 3. The light itself. Very bright. It does have a slight blueish tinge to it that didn't bother me. It also covered the whole page, and since the arm is so flexible, you can move the light away from the book to increase coverage.

But, alas. About 5 minutes after I turned it on, the light began to flicker. Now this is annoying. Well, I thought, maybe it's just the battery they sent has been sitting around too long. Nope. New battery, same problem. There's a short or something in the wiring or switch. And the flickering is unbearable when the booklight is the only light in the room, which pretty much is the idea with a booklight.

Seems like if you get a functioning light, this reading light is perfectly good. I've read through just about every review on every booklight on amazon. The problem seems to be that with just about all of them, there seems to be something like a 1 in 10 chance that you'll just get a dud. Total guess on actual numbers, but you get the idea. For every booklight, there's at least a few people that get one that doesn't work. I'm that guy with this one. So, one-star.",1.0
"Be hestitant to buy this lamp, it comes with batteries and light bulbs that supposedly need no replacement.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have used this lamp and it quit working.  I tried to replace the batteries, didn't work.  Trying to decide if I should attempt to replace the light bulbs or send it back for a partial refund of my money.... either way, buy with caution.",1.0
"after 5 minutes use, it just died.  WOW!!  i bought so many products through amazon so far but i never had a product stopped working after 5 minutes.
it seemed to work well at the first time and my wife liked it for minutes then it stopped. i don't recommend this thing to anyone. NEVER!!!",1.0
"Arrived without working! :( I replaced the batteries a few times, still nothing. I tossed it.
If anyone can rec a good booklight for my K3 please advise.",1.0
I purchased this light to attach to my Kindle E-Reader. Although it is small the clip is to big and bulky for my reader. I ended up purchasing the  lighted leather book cover case. I love this-the light is less obtrusive and perfect for reading in low light areas!,1.0
"I purchased this light in late July 2010.  It now does not work at all.  Even for the price, I think it should last longer than 2 months.",1.0
This light was only good for a few hours and then needed a new battery.  The company had me return it and they sent another that wasn't any better.  They gave me a refund and I returned the second one.  I will never buy another book light using only a AAA battery.  I've given up trying to find a light for my portable book reader.,1.0
"After purchasing 2 of the older incandescent models I had to stop using them as music stand lights. Despite the convenience of wire free operation and their ability to put the beam right on the page while keeping it out of the audiences line of sight, they blew bulbs CONTINUALLY. I was ""left in the dark"" on several crucial occassions. That was not what I had in mind when I purchased them.
  So I decided to try the single LED model. I bought two of them and within a month they became intermittent. The vibrations on stage would actually cause them to go to 1/2 light or fail completely. A source of irritation both to me & MY EMPLOYER!!
  As to customer service, I had a better experience than some of the other reviewers. When I contacted them to report the problem and see if perhaps I was doing something wrong, they got back to me in a reasonable time frame and sent me a replacement. Which promptly failed as well.
  Anyway, my advice is to avoid these products as they seem to suffer some real durability issues in thier design. Just shoddy",1.0
"I have still not received this Light.  I emailed the supplier asking for a shipping reference number and they replied saying that it had been shipped; but, did not send a tracking number for it.  Disappointed.  Diane Donovan",1.0
"Purchased the silver color one from an Amazon Marketplace seller. The light just stopped working after only one month. Then the seller (Shoreline Music) told me it's over one month, so I can only get replacement from the manufacturer. I called the customer service of Mighty Blue and left a message about the situation but never heard back from them. I may try calling again later, but so far I'm very disappointed at the quality and service of this product. Would not recommend at all!",1.0
Don't expect it to last more than a few months.  It works nicely while it works but my first lasted about 6 months and the second has started to go after a couple of weeks.,1.0
"I bought the silver mighty bright flex 2.  I fastened it to a book and began to read.  Before I finished the first page, the light went out.  If I hold the button down, the light works but it is very unhandy to try to read and hold the button down.  Apparently the button has a short somewhere.  You would think that they would test the product before packaging to eliminate production defects.  I ordered it on ebay, so it will likely be quite a hassle to return it.  After reading so many 5 star reviews, I thought that I would be getting a product that I would be happy with.  Perhaps they have all been written by company employees.",1.0
"I bought and used the mighty bright light at home for reading.  The light is not all that bright but this was a minor flaw.  The real issue is after using it for a couple months the damn thing fell apart at the head.  The warranty is non existent so if it breaks the day you get it you're out of luck...

Currently I am looking for one either from a place that provides some type of warranty on electronics, or one that comes with a minimum 1 year warranty",1.0
"I have had a total of three of these booklights. The first one lasted a year before the clip broke. I ordered two the next time and within 2 months they both broke, at the same place, the clip. I managed to scavenge parts from one and put it back together, but it only lasted a week. The plastic is so brittle that either the clip itself breaks, or the hinge breaks where the clip fits on to the base. I have had it with these--they should last longer than this!",1.0
Very weak illumination of the book page - in an emergency I would read from it - but never for any length of time and never without another light source,1.0
This light worked great the first time I used it....lit up both pages of my book.  After the first time... it lights up about 1/2 sentence!  I have to keep moving the light to follow my page... I gave up and no longer use it!  Waste of money!,1.0
"My experience with the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 contrasts with many of the other reviewers.  I received mine today and inserted new batteries and the unit would not work.  I opened the case and the batteries and the connector springs were extremely hot.  I hope you have better luck.  I will return mine.  This is another of those items made in China and somehow, I am not surprised.",1.0
"Less than a year old and it constantly blinks on and off due to loose connection, Do not recommend at all.... May be mighty bright, but mighty poor quality.",1.0
"Maybe mine is defective, but you need night vision goggles to read with this book light - provides a softy hazy glow only.  I bought this having read previous reviews and was sorely disappointed - one of the worst book lights I've ever had!",1.0
"This light didn't work when it arrived.  I thought maybe the batteries were dead, so I bought two more batteries (at 5.50 each, cost more than the light!)  The light worked when the new batteries were installed, but less than 24 hours later - again no light.

By that time I had thrown out the box, and just too much of a hassle to send back a 9.99 item.",1.0
"Worked for a few days and then quit working
We thought maybe it needed new batteries so we spent $10 on a new pack of batteries.
When we got home and put the new batteries in, the light still didn't work. Very disappointed!",1.0
"Worthless! The light was barely visible and too weak to see anything, so I changed the battery in case that was the issue and it stopped working entirely.",1.0
"light has trouble going on and now will not turn off.  We bought it early as a gift for daughter, she just opened it yesterday and unfortunately it is too late for us to return it.",1.0
"Spring busted the first week, button broke the next have to push button like 30 times to turn it on!",1.0
Does not work clip does not stay close so it keeps falling off. Second light broke and I only use it 4 times since dec. not worth the money.,1.0
"Would not recommend this product. When you squeeze the clip in order to clip it to a book, the battery cover slides off and the batteries fall out. Also, replacement batteries do not seem to work effectively in making a connection. Havent been able to use it at all since purchasing it.",1.0
"Came intact inside of the box, tried to turn on and it didn't work. We checked the batteries and still nothing. My child was disappointed,  never again.",1.0
Lasted about 3 months. In use about 20 min a night.,1.0
"Came late and doesn't work.  Not cheap for the inconvenience of having to go buy another battery to see if it can be saved.
A replacement from the seller is the least the could do!",1.0
Light arrived and doesnt work.  Hoping batteries are just bad.,1.0
"This product is very good when it works. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long.",1.0
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It is now December 27, and it stopped working already. I don't expect the battery to last forever, but it should survive a 30 minute car ride!",1.0
"Received the order in the good time frame. I took out the battery tab, turned on the light, it stayed on for 3 seconds, then went out. Hasn't come on since. I've had better book lights from the $ store. Don't buy.",1.0
"Lasted less than 2 weeks. The light started flickering and then the neck came lose from the base, exposing the wires.",1.0
Broke after one use..,1.0
"This book light does not work!
Extremely disappointing!
A birthday gift that made the child sad.
Should discontinue this brand.",1.0
Junk! Broke before I even had a chance to use it!,1.0
"The lights are cute, the metal neck holds its shape well, and the light is bright. The clip is strong, but a tad bulky and heavy.  However, I ordered three of these...on day 2 one no longer worked, and by day 5 the second one stopped working! So I have one light working out of three! Very upsetting. The price is expensive for such a faulty product.",1.0
The light died after using it three times. Waste of money.,1.0
It was a disappointment.  It did not give off enough light for me to read by it.,1.0
"I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it a little over a month ago and last week it died. I figured it was the batteries so I got more (which cost more than the light mind you) but it died completely a few days after changing them. Rip off, don't buy this product.",1.0
Cute light but it worked for a month. Replaced batteries and still light no longer functions. Waste of 10 bucks...,1.0
"too bright for nighttime reading, would be better with a dimmer",1.0
Does not work.,1.0
Very cute however it broke same day we opened it.  It goes for a few minutes then turns off even if your not touching it.  I would return it but my son threw out the packaging already.,1.0
Cute and convenient but the light portion broke from the adjustable metal wire after two weeks. Trashed it.,1.0
We ordered this light as a Christmas present for our 9-year-old avid reader.  It stopped working circa Day 3.  It's possible that she dropped it - but it seems to me that an LED reading light should be slightly more durable than this.  Waste of money.,1.0
"The button is so small, it is very hard to turn it on",1.0
This worked the first time we turned it on and then not again. Very disappointing.,1.0
"Received this item broken. 7 yr old opened it on Christmas morning and was ecstatic, only to be crushed when it did not work. If you really twist and bend the metal, you can get it to turn on every once in a while, but this doesn't seem safe. Very disappointed.",1.0
cheaply made,1.0
It didn't work when I bought so I returned it. I purchased a different brand from a different vendor.,1.0
"My daughter was very excited about this light, but she only had the chance to use it two times before it broke! :( The metal adjusting arm slipped out of the plastic clip and there in no way to get it back in.",1.0
"Used this light for about 4 nights, now it doesn't work.",1.0
Cute but the battery was dead when we received it. I went out and bought new batteries but then the light broke off. Very disappointed.,1.0
This item broke the first time we used it. It's junk. Don't order.,1.0
Received the wrong one.  Got the football one instead,1.0
Did not work out of box,1.0
"First this arrived in a blue paisley. I ordered a football one, the package said it was a football one but it was definitely not. It is just a book light so I made my kid keep it.
Then it stopped working after about 1 week.  He hardly used it and turned it off every time. Money wasted. It was a good size had it been what I ordered and actually worked I think I would have like it.",1.0
"This reading light quit working after one week of use. There was no abuse or foul play. The light was not left on over night, nor did a battery change help. Waste of money.",1.0
Died with 3 days.,1.0
"Purchased this as a stocking stuffer. It literally was out of the box for 2 minutes and the metallic  neck snapped on the ""clipping"" end. I bought this for my 7 year old daughter so naturally she was devastated. I don't know if it was shipped defective, but I watched her clip it on her book, and pull the light down and it snapped.

I'd not recommend this product.",1.0
Broke the first time we positioned light to read a book. Metal broke in half at the clip.,1.0
Would not buy again.,1.0
Battery died too fast.,1.0
"Waste of money! It was for My 8 year old, would come out of the clip easily, about the second ord third use, the contact for charging broke! She used it until it ran out of battery but i think it was pretty  expensive for a cheaply made lamp..",1.0
"Returned, it wouldn't charge.",1.0
I am not thrilled with this light.  The light part is nice and bright to read.  But the USB part that unplugs for charging easily falls off the clip.  It's hard to get in the right position in a charger for charging.  I also have a hard time getting it to the positions I would want it to be.,1.0
Did not work to charge and never had a light. Would not recommend.,1.0
The usb piece to plug into the computer to charge - it didn't work at all and it barely fit in the usb port of my laptop so I returned it.,1.0
"Very cute book light, but it comes apart very easily where the flexible neck connects to the clip and won't stay together.",1.0
"Light started acting up after only a couple weeks. It would refuse to turn off or on, seemingly at random. After another week it stopped working altogether. To charge the thing, you must insert the base of the light into a USB port. However, USB connection at the base is rather cheap and doesn't make good contact for charging, especially if the USB port is not angled just right. I had to balance the light on the port just right to get it to charge and many of my USB charging options were not conducive to this balancing act. Finally, just ordered my daughter a ""grown-up"" reading light.",1.0
"I bought this product in May and am trying to recharge it for the first time. I cannot get it to charge at all. I've tried using the USB port on the laptop, as well as a USB compatible charger straight into the wall plug, but nothing is working. No indicator lights even come on to show that it is charging. I don't know if I am doing something wrong? It seems so simple.",1.0
The item that was delivered is much smaller than what appears in the sale picture.  I really thought the decal would atleast be large enough to use 4x6 or 3x5 pics on the tree. Not at all what the picture shows! Very disappointed!,1.0
"Warm white, no.  Vegas white, yes.
Sure, it's all subjective, but I'd hate to see cool white.
Misled by color and for that reason I would not recommend this seller nor the lights.",1.0

These bulbs are WORTHLESS ... I tried each bulb in the package and none worked in my desk lamp.... although they are packaged and labeled as replacement bulbs for GY6.35 --> they in fact are bigger bulbs with longer metal contact stems .... Today I went to a Lamps Plus Retail Store and bought a GY6.35 bulb ... Low and Behold my desk lamp works ... DO NOT buy these CB CONCEPT Brand GY6.35 Bulbs under any circumstances - the Seller and the Manufacturer are RIPPING US  OFF...

Lights super dim.  Had to return.  Output more like a 10W light.,1.0
It will not make a good interference fit into the socket and consequently slips out. I had to use a small piece of Aluminum foil to make the fit tighter. Will not buy from this manufacturer again.,1.0
advertized size was not actual. these were 2mm too long for my fixtures. sent them back for others. hope they're better.,1.0
Awful bulbs. Pins push in too easily rendering the bulb trash and constantly flickers which I assumed would happen while dimming but even when switch is full on it still flickers. Also color temperature of day light is way too stark. I had more hope with so many positive reviews.,1.0
"Terrible flicker and buzz. These say they are dimmable. I strongly disagree. They had a very intense flicker at most brightness levels. Even when it wasn't flicking with seisure inducing intensity, there was an audible buzz emitted. These bulbs are unusable for me.",1.0

Just checked the continuity through the bulb and it checks out. Checked the bulbs in a second fixture, and they also don't light in that fixture.

Note that bulbs are about twice as large as the one they were intended to replace.

Note also that the bulb glass is not frosted-- not that it matters if they don't light. $10 wasted.",1.0
"Updated 6Mar2015: these bulbs are actually not a great match for the fixture. The terminals are too long and too thin. Had to trim them, but can't really solve the thickness part :-(

"Yes this has a G8 Base but don't bother if your fixture does not have unlimited room for this to stick out.

"Well, yes, these Bulbs are cheap. Therefore, they do work for 50 - 100 hours only, so they are not really priceworthy. I can not recommend buying them, unless you love the process of changing these bulbs at difficult places ...",1.0
At $1 a piece I thought I would try this product.  One of the 10 burned out immediately when I turned on the switch.  I have already had 2 more bulbs burn out after less than 10 days (running about 8 hours per day).  I think I would rather go for a more reliable product.,1.0

I've purchased from CB off of ebay in the past too so they're not a new company to me.  It's been months now since this purchase was made and thought to comment on the white lights  since that is what needed to be taken down from our physical store today.

Read between the lines because I have to get back to work:

Lights are bright in one direction but one would have to twist the rope to find the direction that will focus the light application.  Maybe more lights would make it brighter or better led's I don't know.

I'm going through our 110v lights now and will hopefully be getting more of the 12v ones to put in their place.  If I recall correctly CB sells these also but the same day I ordered and noticed the error requesting that the order be changed to 12v lights (over 300dollars worth) but they said that it could not be done even thought they hadn't shipped yet.  no bigee really.

Now of the rest of the lights purchased from CB?  I'll comment on them as I get to them.  Our store will be selling all these 110v lights so I'll have rightful comments in due time.  I don't think any of CB's stuff is cheap or broken so that's a plus for the seller.",1.0
I ordered these bulbs and within 2 months I've had to change them out three times. I purchased this same brand in Jan 2016 and they lasted me all year. This set of 12 didn't even last 3 weeks before going out. I'm not sure if it was a bad batch but if you notice them going out reply right away unlike me because the return window is past due and I'm stuck having to order more bulbs....,1.0

Dont buy these. They keep blowing off in less than a month. Dont know if they have a replacement warranty. No life information on the box.,1.0
Totally unsatisfactory.  The wire connector pins are slightly larger than the fixture would accommodate comfortably and had to be forced in.  the bulbs did not last more than a few months in my outside fixtures.,1.0

The LED versions do not work as advertised. These are not dimmable, technically they dim just a tiny bit before flickering and then completely cutting out. My video shows 2 of these LED bulbs versus a halogen bulb. Clearly, not dimmable. Also, they are no where near 330 lumens. You can look directly at the bulb and see the LEDs which are lit, but not bright.

I was looking to find LED versions of G4 bulbs to replace by 20W halogen bulbs. I was not able to find anyone who sold dimmable LED versions, except for this vendor. Turns out that these are not dimmable either.",1.0

Awful. One of the cords stopped working after 2 days.,1.0
Bulbs only last 2-3 weeks before burning out.,1.0
These were super cheap and I understand why. I'm using the 3rd one in just over 2 months. My old one was bought locally and cost nearly $30 so I understand why these were so cheap. They are just that....cheap and do not last. I would NOT buy this product again. I bought it online for convenience. I will go to an electrical supply store after I use the remaining 4.,1.0
"I have purchased items for many years from Amazon, and for the most part, I've had fairly good results with my purchases.  I do have to admit, that I am not one who posts reviews on products which perform as advertised, so consider this an exception to that philosophy. That is to say until this purchase.

First of all, I originally ordered 10 watt bulbs to replace existing 20 watt bulbs which come with the original outdoor lighting I'd purchased elsewhere.  Needless to say, when you have 16, 20 watt landscape lights in your yard, it easily can be mistaken for an airport run way, hence the desire for 10 watt bulbs.  I ordered the 20 pack 10 watt bulbs from this company, and 2 days later, I received a 20 pack 20 watt bulbs.  Fair enough, everyone makes mistakes. Amazon promptly corrected this issue.  Once I did receive the correct bulbs, I proceeded to replace all the original 20 watt bulbs with the 10 watt bulbs I ordered through this company and Amazon.

According to their product description https://www.amazon.com/dp/7502175741/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 "" Product description MR11 12V 10W Precision Halogen Light Bulbs 3000 hrs useful hours 3000 k"", which I thought should be more than long enough to last through the year. I was surprised that within 2 weeks of installing these bulbs, and running less than 8 hours a night, I had 4 failures... seems a lot less than the 3000 hrs listed.  Long story short, after less than 3 months, every bulb as failed, so for a total of 20 bulbs, I received a combined use life of less than 900 hours of life for 20 bulbs... seems to me a lot shorter than the advertised 300 hours of life/bulb.

At this point, I can't say more than, you might want to really reconsider this product, though, I guess you get what you pay for, which in this case I paid for a lot more than I got.",1.0

"I purchased a 10 pack of these bulbs in 2014.  I have now used two of the 10 in my kitchen chandelier (now December 2015) and they have worked fine until they reach the end of their life span and EXPLODE sending shards of glass all over the kitchen table with great force.  I fear that these bulbs are a safety hazard and should not be allowed to be sold in the USA.  I plan to contact the Consumer Product Safety Commission and report CBConcept Brads and Amazon for selling these.  I just made an attempt to return my remaining 8 bulbs for a refund on Amazon.com, but I am now too far past the date that Amazon will accept returns.  I am thankful that my family was not harmed by this dangerous product.",1.0

they came in white not amber,1.0
"I ordered several LED ropes from CBconcept through Amazon and even directly. There are two main problems with the product and the company. First, while I ordered all the ropes as ""warm white"", I received only two warm white ropes,  I received three bright white ropes and I even received a blue rope. If you think you can order multiple ropes and have the colors matched, think again. Secondly, I had counted on connecting the ropes together, as their literature says you can do. However, the 50 foot ropes I ordered have a totally different connector than the 18 foot ropes so they don't interconnect. The source of the problem is that CBconcept doesn't manufacture their products, they purchase them probably from China and they source them from different manufacturers. This is why different lengths don't interconnect, and colors don't match (see picture). I strongly recommend staying with recognized brands that have a consistent source for their product and avoid these. If you ever count on needing to interconnect them or want the same colors to match in different ropes, forget it. Their customer service is not helpful either as they can't solve the problem.",1.0
"This product looks more yellow than green and it lights up fine if it's rolled up. Once it's unrolled, there is a section that turns off but will flicker on and off if the rope is jiggled.....not too please with this!",1.0
"priced right and looks OK, but it doesn't work
there is discoloration in the plastic mold on the connectors that is likely part of the reason that this never flickered any light.",1.0
"I bought 12 of these bulbs in December 2010, 6 of them have burned out so far (in about 5 months). In fact, another fixture still has the same (older) bulb working while I have replaced its neighbor six times. Be aware that the life of these bulbs is short!",1.0
"Service was okay, but the bulbs don't work.  They'll light if you hold them in the socket, but the pins are of too small a gauge to make good contact or stay securely in the sockets of my low voltage lighting.  My first clue was that the pins have sharp pointed ends like they're made of wire brads instead of electrical components of the correct gauge.  I would never order again.",1.0
"I've been looking for inexpensive alternatives to the $7 each malibu bulbs for my yard, and I was very excited when I came across these. They look very similar to the malibu and FEIT bulbs, but have a lens over the top that the others do not have. I thought this might be good, as maybe improved protection from the elements would extend their life. Upon installation they fit the fixtures fine and lit up brightly, as expected. That was the good news. The bad news is that they all failed within a month of installation, some within a few days. They simply burned out, as evidenced by the clear glass going to a frosted look. By contrast, the Malibu and FEIT bulbs would last for months and months before needing replacement (normally due to one of the posts corroding away). I will continue my hunt for a cost effective replacement bulb, but I won't be buying this one again, regardless of the price. Don't be lured in by the low cost. They're just horrible bulbs.",1.0
"These bulbs fail at an alarming rate! I've been using them in the vent hood over my stove, and the average bulb life appears to be about 3 months, so I've gone through 12 in 18 months (two bulbs at a time in the vent hood). I'm totally puzzled. I will try another brand. I would buy an LED alternative, but I don't think the LED bulbs are yet small enough to fit in this narrow orifice.",1.0
Did not work out,1.0
"I just tried putting these light bulbs in for my under cabinet lights, and they did not work. All they did was dim and kind of go on and off... Does anyone have the same problem?",1.0
"Burn out in a couple months. Same product 20 W version lasting over a year. However, they paid for themselves in energy saved, so if you do not mind frequent bulb replacement, not a bad deal. I do, hence the low score.",1.0
These bulbs were not very good at all. Lasted about 20 hours then had to replace each one. Not impressed. Better buy a new lamp instead of these replacement bulbs,1.0
"Upon receiving this order, I put one in my under cabinet light fixture and it has been working fine.  However, last week another bulb went out in a different fixture and I replaced it with an CBconceot bulb.  Almost immediately, it began to smoke so I took it out and replaced it with another CBconcept bulb and it too began to smoke.  At this point I thought the fixture itself had a problem ,but to make sure I went to Home Depot and bought a halogen bulb.  I got home and put it in the fixture and it worked fine.  I immediately threw the remaining CBconcept bulbs away and won't purchase any more of them.",1.0
"Lasted about 4 months in outside lights that run 6 hrs a day.  Will go back to a different brand.  Yes the price is great, but if you can spend 2x as much and get over a year its worth it.",1.0

Died after less than 2 month of use.,1.0
"Multiple have died within 30 days. Terrible product.

Updated.  We tried the 'use gloves' technique.  I can confirm I went through all 10 bulbs in 6 months for two pendant lights, so they last about a month each.  Some longer, some shorter.",1.0

"20000k bulbs suck! these things are supposed to be a blue'ish color, there is noting that is blue about these at 20000k should have that glare, they are more like 10000k they look yellow, these make my reef look like crap, i want a refund you can have you're bulbs back :(",1.0
"Ordered 2 bulbs to try out over my reef tank, one bulb looks to have a color temperature of 6k while the other one had a connection break right as I was putting it in. Bad product.",1.0
"Didnt work, should have known better, not worth the time to return it. I Went with the Phoenix bulb instead.",1.0

"You get what you pay for, I guess.  I thought these bulbs were pretty poor quality.  The first one out of the pack did failed to illuminate.  The pins were of such a small gauge it was hard to get them to make good contact in the sockets.",1.0
These were brought to my attention via an Amazon search for replacement bulbs for Malibu lights.  These are completely wrong for the application.  I tried to bend the leads to make it fit and the bulb cracked. Now I can't return them.  I should have been more careful in trusting that it would work for the application.,1.0
"The package says something like 10,000 hours.  The description page says 3,000 hours.  I don't think you'd come anywhere close to either of those numbers if you added up the life of all 10 bulbs.  I've gone through 3 or 4 of them since I received them a few months ago.  According to some, you aren't supposed to touch these types of bulbs directly with your fingers.  I can't find any solid evidence that doing so reduces bulb life, but I even tried installing the bulbs without touching them.  Didn't help.  Garbage.",1.0
What arrived isn't what's pictured. Pictured are cylindrical pins.  Received are wire loops that do not fit my fixture.  Annoyed.,1.0

"First couple of days I really love the light because it bright however after couple of days the bulbs starting to die. Within 2 weeks 4 bulbs dead.

Update: Almost 3 weeks 9 bulbs dead. Emailed seller but no response. Not 1500hours as they claimed but its like 1.5hours life. Avoid this brand !!",1.0
Garbage bulbs. All burned out within days under normal use. I went cheap and I got what I paid for.,1.0
"Well, I used six of the 10 bulbs and in less than 3 hours half of them burned out. Also, these bulbs are about 30% shorter than other brand G9 bulbs I have used in the past....not sure if it matters but very odd. I plan on returning these and going back to my old brands.",1.0

"Definitely NOT worth the effort, these bulbs DO NOT LAST and the low price should not be cause to try them out. Sorry, I have to find some better ones as my time is worth more to me.",1.0
"wrong size for the round light I have. These are very small. I need prongs that are about 3/8"" apart and these are about 1/8"" apart. They may be just what you are looking for. Its hard to buy these things without a sizing chart or info.",1.0
"You know that this item is cheap, and you correlate that with quality. You may try to justify this purchase by thinking, even if it doesn't work as well as those you get from Home Depot, you might still come ahead with 10 of these cheap bulbs - WRONG! My new replacement bulb died after merely 2 weeks. My previous one (got from a local hardware store) used in my desk lamp broke after 3 years.",1.0
"I ordered these bulbs and then they shipped from China. Two weeks later I got parts for weed eaters. I emailed the company and two more weeks I got bulbs. The box the bulbs came in said they were LED bulbs, which they weren't. The bulbs are not marked in any way. The only thing I can say is they have the correct base. Who know what watts, volts, etc. I will never order through this company again.",1.0
"They worked for a few days then burnt out. Went through 5 or 6, all the same. Not worth the bother.",1.0
"I cheaped out to buy these instead of the ones I usually buy (http://amzn.to/1YVoHLp). BIG MISTAKE. They performed well initially, but then one of them melted, damaged my light fixture and caused a fire hazard. I remove all the installed bulbs and found that many had chipped bases and blackened areas suspicious for excess heat.

Upon reporting this to the company, they seemed helpful at first: advised me to throw them all away and promised to pay for replacements. However later they refused to pay.",1.0
Light bulbs looked great.  I put them into my light bar and they were blowing out in a day or two.  Bulbs from IKEA were lasting months.  Not such a great deal.,1.0
"Issue 1: Bulb life - After blowing through half the bulbs purchased (10) I can report the average bulb life is about 100 hours (3 weeks of average use). Box says each bulb lasts 2000 hours (not even close).
Issue 2: Brightness - ""20 Watt"" - no way. Noticeably dimmer than the more expensive halogen 20 Watt bulb in the lamps surrounding this one.

Switched bulbs to make sure it wasn't a socket issue. Same result. Buyer beware....",1.0
"I ordered the CBConcept Brand Halogen Light Bulb JC G4 12volt 20 watt bulbs. They put out a small fraction of the light put out by the 12 volt 20 watt bulbs I was previously using. Hence, I thought that I could solve the problem simply by ordering 35 watt bulbs from this supplier (CBConcept ).  However, even the 35 watt bulbs put out much less light than regular 20 watt bulbs. But by the time that I got the 35 watt bulbs and tried them, the short return time limit for this supplier had expired and I was not able to return the junk 20 watt bulbs.

"I was at first thrilled to find an inexpensive replacement for the halogen light fixture on my ceiling fan. Sadly these bulbs only lasted a week , not the 1500 hours described on the web site. I thought the first one might have been defective but the second bulb only lasted a week as well. The other original light bulbs ( which cost about $5 per bulb are still working).",1.0
"Have six Malibu garden lights.  When Two were out I got these replacement bulbs.  The four that were working are still working but the two replaced with these bulbs go out on average in two to four weeks.  I have gone through all of these ten just in two spots!  Yes, cheaper than HD, but not when you consider the bother of constant replacement.  Will pay more for better quality but these didn't measure up.",1.0

 I was very surprised to read that what was listed under my order for the light bulbs was not what I did write in my order!

These bulbs are not worth the bargain price -- they don't last nearly as long as other brands I've had (Some lasted less than a week) and changing bulbs all the time is a pain in the neck.,1.0

"These are very cute but did not stick like other decals I have used.  The thin pieces (water) came up on the edges and in some cases actually fell off the wall.  The rock pieces came up in places, but the fish did stay in place.  After trying multiple times, I gave up on the water pieces then used some putty from a glow in the dark star kit to make the rocks stay in place.  It did make a cute scene, but I was disappointed in the quality.  I have never had this problem with other brands of decals.",1.0
"The bulbs started out great. They weren't as bright as advertised, but hey, saving on electricity is great and LEDs have a long life. However, within 4-5 months of their installation in my yard, all 5 of the lights began to dim. By the end of the 5th month, every single one of them was dead. When I opened them up for diagnosis, I found blown almost all of the 3 mini-LEDs inside each light. I assumed water damage. But these are advertised for landscape lighting.

I don't know whether these lights will work indoors in a dry place any better, but they certainly are a waste of money for landscape lighting. Meanwhile, my built-in LED spotlight and traditional halogen bulbs on the same circuit have remained perfectly lit. Avoid these.",1.0
"These bulbs, 12 of them in front of the house, killed the range on my garage door opener remotes.  I've sinced learned that appears to be a common issue with cheaper LED bulbs.  As best I can tell, the intererence likely means the bulbs are non-compliant with current FCC regs.  It's a shame, too, since I really like the look of the bulbs.",1.0
Did not fit in fixture. They were longer than the bulbs I was replacing.,1.0
"Cheap Chinese-made bulbs have poor quality control and low quality materials so they don't last, no matter what any so-called guarantee says.

Ordered 10 and only 3 lasted more than a few days. Buy USA, Japanese or European  bulbs only, or you will pay much more for your ""bargain bulbs"" per hour of light than more expensive ones cost. Never pays to go cheap on halogen bulbs.",1.0
"Found these bulbs through your site. Great price, in fact best price ever! But apparently just too good to be true. The 12 bulbs arrived and only two of the 12 were the size I ordered. That after waiting more than 3 weeks for them to arrive. Never again from your site.",1.0

"I bought these decals to complete a hummingbird themed room. I already had hummingbird decals on the walls and wanted to add some flowers/trees. The stickers started falling off the walls within a few hours after getting them up.  It took my daughter and myself almost an hour to get them on the wall just perfectly. When I returned to the room later that night, half the stickers were sitting on the floor and the other half were hanging off the wall.  I went WalMart and purchased a spray adhesive that is used for wall paper. The next day, I had to separate the stickers that had fallen to the ground and curled themselves together. I then spent another hour spraying and placing the stickers again.  Within two days they began peeling off the wall again. They are absolutely worthless.",1.0
"This glass end is slightly different shaped (thicker) than the other brands I buy at the hardware stores. I had to apply a lot of pressure to push this one in and was serious afraid to break it. In the end I managed but will not buy again... One down, 9 more to go...",1.0

I thought this would be a great enhancement for the nursery as it is only temporary.  ""Temporary"" is exactly how long it lasted.  I began peeling the stickers off the sheet and the cuts made to the outline of the flowers and branches actually created little tears in the stickers.  It looked as though a razor blade had been used across some of the stickers.....needless to say it is not on my wall and in the trash  (within 13 minutes).  It is not the first time I have wasted 12.99, I am sure it will not be the last, but what a waste of money regardless.",1.0
"The blossoms are hot pink and not light pink as pictured.  No instructions came with it.  Pieces are numbered, but they don't match up.

"I bought this product along with other wall stickers. While the others were the usual stickers easy to remove from the paper and easy to reposition if needed, this particular one was VERY different. The paper/film itself is really difficult to remove and VERY thin. If by accident you get two pieces together they are really stuck. I just broke quite a few trying to put it up on my wall. If I were in the States I would try to return.",1.0

"I did order the Cherry Blossom Wall Art; however, what I received did not look anything like the picture I observed.  It was a multi-colored photo that did not blend with my decor.

Please advise.

"After less than one week the stickers began to peel off the wall and now I can't keep them from falling.  It's annoying and looks awful.  I would NOT recommend you purchase these.

UPDATE: After taking down all the decals, I have splotches and staining on the paint.  SO not worth the money.",1.0
"Wow I was so excited to see this...I wanted to put this on top of our bed headboard. When I opened the packet I was extremely disappointed. It look very trashy n cheap. I would not even have spent a dollar on this had I seen it in person. I have no more words to describe just how bad this is. 13$ is TOO MUCH for this crap.

Its not elegant looking at all. The photos are so misleading. I was doubtful but got it anyways as it had 4 stars!

Total waste of money.",1.0
"I bought these based on wattage given.  But it turns out that they do not give anywhere near as much light as the other bulbs I had purchased that were also labeled the equivalent of 25 watts.  The difference is dramatic.  So although they were so much cheaper, they do not give anywhere near as much light.  The bulbs I had purchased at our local hardware store at $7.99 each were labeled 255 lumens.  The CBConcept package does not list the lumens.  Moral of the story is to buy based on lumens, not wattage.  As for me, I am no longer purchasing any bulb that does not list the lumens.  So if CBConcept does not list lumens, I am not buying them.",1.0
I bought several sets and they are  no good. They are so thin that you cannot peel them off without ripping them. They do not stick well. Very thin. I got what I paid for next time I will spend more money for the good ones.,1.0
"I bought this item because of good reviews and price. It turned out a poorly made cheap item - you even could not peel each piece off completely.  The decal piece tear apart and could not use it anymore.  Comparing to other Made In Korean items, this item does not worth of $5 selling price.  In order to minimize the cost for us and Amazon, we decided to toss it instead of returning it, but will never buy it from this Chinese seller again.",1.0
"I will not deny that they are mega cute and adorable but they are actual paper stickers! They have white trim on them like normal stickers. While other wall decors I have bought are more clear and see through like. These are paper stickers..  The Packaging even says ""decorative combination sticking paper"". But my room is light green so if I put these up with my other sticker decors I purchased hey will look cheap and the white trim will stand out. BUT if you do not mind the trim/white baking..and do not have better quality ones in the same room maybe they will suit you. I just wanted to share my disappointment so others would know.",1.0
"They looked cute online, but then when we tried to peel them off the sheet - they all split. They are really tiny and look nothing like the size in the description's photo. The tree you see in the photo is not included. It's just the cat, puppy, some leaves, flowers and clouds. When I say tiny, I mean the puppy is less than 3 inches tall. The whole thing was so fragile that it fell apart. And they don't stick well - the next morning when we went into our daughter's room, the puppy was half curled up on the wall. A waste of money for a few tiny pieces that won't stick, can't be moved and break apart easily :(",1.0

I guess you get what you pay for, but I paid 24.00 and this thing is worth .24 cents.  If your buying it for a fun Halloween decoration, I guess it's not bad.

I owned one of these about 12 years ago and it was 1000 times better then the one I got today.  I opened the pckage and saw 100's of little paint chips.  all the paint is pelling of the inside of the sign making it totally useless .  Not worth the cost to ship it .,1.0

Not worth it.,1.0
"I purchased this prop three years ago at a Halloween store in Michigan, after seeing STOCK images of it online at various shops. Being a huge fan of ""Psycho,"" I thought it was absolutely ingenious; and it is, until you plug it in and see that the manufacturing design of the prop leaves it almost *impossible* to read through a window in the dark. It literally looked like blue bulbs and a red blur in a sea of black plastic.

 Now, hanging inside on a wall, the prop is slightly more legible and somewhat usable--but who wants it inside instead of in a window, like a REAL vacancy sign? I opened mine up and tried to adjust the bulbs, even placing foil behind them to help with the reflection; it made it barely legible in a window at night.

 Ultimately, this could have been one of the BEST Halloween props I've ever seen, but the shoddy design makes it worth about $5 instead of the $25+ you usually see it priced at. A shame, really.",1.0
"Unbelieveable cheap flimsy material.  Cannot read letters on sign from outside window.  When Rubies the shipper sent box, they just put sign in box WITHOUT any type of packing material.

This was a gift for my son, and I was so sad I had to give his this gift in such poor and unexcusable condition.",1.0
"I purchased the 690LR via amazon, and it comes with a 1/2 and a 1/4 inch collet. The 1/2 inch collet is fine, but I am unable to screw the 1/4 collet on. I assume there is some sort of defect in the threads. It is hard to examine, still less try to repair, the inside threading.",1.0

It will plunge fine, and if you're not concerned about fine depth adjust, its ok. I would rather spend more money on a dedicated plunge router. The motor clamp is hokey as others have mentioned. The plunge is not smooth and binds.",1.0
"Originally, I rated this as four stars, now reduced to one star.

My original review follows; revised comments appear in a separate posting below it.

""Excellent upgrade for my 20+ year old PC 690.  Fit and finish are first-rate.  Method to secure the body of the router motor is a little hokey (essentially uses a screw-tightened barrel nut that leverages a steel piece that bites into the aluminum body slightly) and not elegant at all, but it works.

The most difficult aspect for some may be in orienting this piece to bite into the motor body.  Second to that is determining how high the motor sits in the base.  You don't have to be an engineer to do it, just use logic.  Instructions are left wanting in that regard.  Once set up, it works fine.

Wipe off the excess oil from the guide posts a couple of times after cycling the router up and down to keep the oil off of your work.  My base was aligned well and did not need adjustment. The baseplate is black with large holes in it; clear plastic would have been much better.  The baseplate hole for use of collets was properly sized. Handles are round which work fine. They were tight and solid.  Control access is good and fairly natural.  Dust collection would be a nice addition.

This certainly increased the versatility of the router over when it had a standard base and gave me a package that is more handy to use in many applications than my large handheld router, especially for more delicate work like dovetails.""",1.0
"The base plate was mounted a full 1/16"" off center, causing interference with template guides.  There is no practical way to contact Porter Cable to complain, what else is new?  I could not wait around dickering for a replacement that may be no better, so I have fixed it myself, doing what the manufacturer should have done and did not.  This is not a correction that could be made accurately without machining equipment, so beware.  I am sure Amazon would have made it right; Porter Cable and their foreign manufacturing with no accountability is the problem.",1.0
"just what I needed good price , good service",1.0
"I love Amazon and my Porter Cable 314 trim saw. Got a good deal on it from Amazon and purchased several plywood blades for cutting panels for furniture.
Worked beautifully. Until I had to get several new blade replacements. Holding them side by side to compare with the original, you can see they are very different.
Same model number, but Porter Cable has changed them.
They seem like trashy ""toy"" blades. They immediately start burning the wood in the first foot of a cut. And leaving curls of ply in it's wake. The heck with it. Put the old dull blade back on to finish one cut.
I will return all the blades for a refund.
I was pleased to read the Amazon review from ""Woody"" who suggested Forrest blades.
Yay!
Following his suggestion I found that Forrest 4-1/2 Woodworker II blade # WW04H407080 is literally MADE for the Porter Cable #314. Its pricey, but very high quality to really last<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Porter-Cable-12057-4-1-2-Inch-120-Tooth-TCG-Plywood-Cutting-Saw-Blade-with-3-8-Inch-Arbor/dp/B0000222X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Porter Cable 12057 4-1/2-Inch 120 Tooth TCG Plywood Cutting Saw Blade with 3/8-Inch Arbor</a>.
Actually, just what I wanted.
So, skip this and get the real blade you need. Amazon sells it.
I just ordered it from Amazon.",1.0
"I gave this one star only because I couldn't write a review without one. First time using it, the sander burned up!!!",1.0
"Let me preface this with saying that I'm a huge fan of Porter-Cable.

Pluses:
This product does a great job at sanding, it's not very noisy, and the vibration is pretty well isolated from the user, so one can use it for a while without the numbing effects on your hand.

Minuses:
OMG, Ouch, hot hot!  Seriously, after less than 10 minutes of continual use, this thing gets so hot, you can't touch it without causing pain.  Also, you cannot efficiently change the paper without the supplied tool.  This is only a minor inconvenience, but I imagine losing the tool would cause it to be a huge inconvenience.  Normally, when tools are critical to the function of a product, it comes with a way to attach it to the product, like in the ""good old days"" of drills with chuck keys.

DO NOT BUY unless you have insulated flame retardant hands.",1.0
It was unusable.  The screws in back that you needed to take out (J) when using as a circle guide were impossible to remove.  The screws are now stripped and still have not moved.  Make sure you look at this prior to the 30-day return policy.,1.0
"I ordered this sander in September.  In March, it fell apart while using it.  It only has a 30-day return policy, so I'm out of luck.  I have never, in my 21 years of business, had such a short-lived sander.",1.0
I bought this item because of all the good reviews that it recieved. It does not work. The grinding disc almost immediatly loads up. Then the grinder wants to bounce. This destroys whatever you are trying to strip. I  tried many different speeds and adjustments and I could not get this paint  stripper to work for more than a minute without the disc loading up. In  short- avoid this product.,1.0
"This tool does not perform as described. The discs clog instantly! I would not recomend this to anyone. I have been a professional painter for over 10 years, and was looking for an alternative to heat stripping. The power  paint remover is not it! Don't waste your money.",1.0
Had to cut out a small portion of rotten plywood sub floor blade sucked.  Smoked out on the first of four cuts.  Useless...,1.0
Junk. Would not cut at all. Just burned the wood as the blade heated up.,1.0
"This guide will not fit a 6911 D-handle base as it is supposed to.  The bars a too small in diameter and too close together to fit into the base guide holes.  If you own a 6912 router in a 6911 base, do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
Purchased to route a circle.  Screws stripped on first attempt to add the pin necessary cut circles.,1.0
"If you want a cut to be a sinusoidal shape, buy this blade....",1.0
"This machine is a great idea, but really lacks in results.  The pads that they require are great, but get all full of paint in a very short time.  If you use these pads with a grinder, it works fantastic!  One main Problem with this machine is that it only goes around 5,000 rpm, where a grinder goes 10,000 rpm.  This way the pads last for hours.",1.0
"After 2 hours total use it started making noise and then shattered with pieces flying everywhere. One of the spring's tips were broken off, and the other spring broke in half. Poor quality, expected longer life. Going back to Amazon.",1.0
I have owned 2 others of the Speed Bloc and did not hesitate to order a replacement when the one at the cottage stopped working. Big mistake. Apparently Porter Cable has changed the insides of this sander. On first and each subsequent use it gets so hot it is difficult to continue to hold. Never had that problem with the old ones. Another fine tool lost. Won't be seeking out Porter Cable tools again.,1.0
"This is the worst shop tool I have ever ordered, I tried to set it up to do a cut but the screws are factory sealed with loctite I think, they would not break loose.  All the screw heads striped out, and yes I used the correct bit (new), do yourself a favor and do not buy this tool and I would not recommend this router guide  to any one.",1.0
"Worst shop purchase ever! I was looking for an attachment primarily to cut circles in my projects. In order to do this, you must remove 3 screws from the sliding plate and remove the edge runner. The screws were impossible to remove, and even with an ""easy-out"" they would not come out. So Now I have a tool with 3 stripped screws. Just for information, I also tried the front face screws, which also would no budge. I'm guessing that even though the instructions require their removal to add the swing pin, these screws have been chemically locked in.

And thats not all. The slide to adjust the edge position sticks badly and does not move smoothly. The minute adjustment is a joke since the overall slide binds so badly.

Overall, I'd not wish this product on my worst enemy. It is poorly made, poorly designed, and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it.",1.0
"I purchased this to go with a circular saw I purchased on the same Order.

This does not fit on the saw I ordered; I always check, and didn't see any type of information to indicate this product would not fit on that saw.

Amazon needs to pay more attention to the accessory items it offers when you purchase an item, to make sure the products assigned to individual ID numbers are compatible.",1.0
"dont buy this porter cable 39334 dust bag for your porter cable 324 mag circular saw, it won't fit. there is no bag for this saw",1.0
"I have other Porter Cable products that work well. The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me. It could have easily had more than an additional 2"" of travel with a simple design change. Or you could shorten the beam by 2"" and have the same usable travel with a design change. The pins that adapt it to the router are .014"" under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025"" more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide. Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide, they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes. This is shoddy quality control. Even the screws are an obsolete size which hasn't been used much for more than 25 years. The screw size by the way is #12-24. Most think it is a 5mm, but it is not. I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws. These damned screws if you can find them are over $2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online. That doesn't even consider the cost of shipping and handling. My qualifications are: I have worked in the tool and die trade for 46 years. I have been a supervisor for more than 25 of those years. I have been involved with the design and fabrication of many things that have complexity far beyond this simple edge guide.
I wouldn't be so irritated if the company had the courtesy to respond to my Email, but I have waited since 1/7/2008 and seen nothing except a automatic reply on 1/7/2008 telling me I would get an answer within a few days. This has never arrived. I rate it as a 1-star only because I have the skills to make it more usable.
I have but one way to deal with complacent companies such as this who seem to have a screw you attitude with customers. I will simply never purchase another of their products.

The following is the Email I sent to them:

Where do I contact someone to talk about problems with quality control and design flaws concerning my Porter Cable Router, Bases and Edge Guide?

I was a practicing machinist, toolmaker, shop supervisor and was involved with design engineering in a research facility for over 46 years until I retired a year ago.

I would like to talk to someone who is willing to listen seriously with an open mind and correct some problems. I also have a few questions I'd like to ask from someone involved with design.

I just spent the last hour making precision measurements and find it hard to believe what I discovered.

12/21/2009

Since I wrote this review, I have never received a response from this company. I've concluded I have no use for a company that doesn't respond to a customer's legitimate request. I won't be purchasing any of their products in the future.

"When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!
I have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.
That being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, ""Card Experiments"". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.
And there is SO much different good stuff in here, that you'll probably never need another book for advanced materials.
It is a great book and a great reference to help you on your way to card excellence and showmanship. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",5.0
"If you've mastered Hugard and Braue's stuff, if you can do 60 classic passes per minute, if you have all the time in the world to devote to card sleight of hand, then this is the book for you!  Seriously, this is a truly excellent book.  Buckley's sleights, though not for the faint of heart, are superb.  (He must've been one heckuva cardician!) This is a serious, serious card magic book.  But if you are serious yourself, you'll get it.  Of course, you'll overlook the antiquated prose and Buckley's tremendous ego throughout.  (When you read this material you'll forgive Buckley's self-congratulatory tone.) This is a splendid work for those who want to be the best...",5.0
"I've yet to see a bad review for this book, and there's a reason. This book is terrific. There is however one issue to be addressed. This book is hard!!! Definitely not for beginners, it has some of what I believe are the greatest but hardest card manipulations out there. I definitely recommend it however to the serious card magic enthusiast. There are enough valuable ideas in here to last you a lifetime.",5.0

I hesitated to buy this coloring book for fear I wouldn't like the majority of the images, but to my pleasant surprise, every page contains an image I like.  So, I'm posted this quick video review for anyone else like myself, who might be considering this item, but is hesitating due to not knowing what all the images are.  Hope this helps someone.",5.0

"Sometimes you need something new and special that gives you 30 minutes of piece. I used these waiting at the dentist or a graduation or something. They are small so they slip into a bag and cheap enough, especially with the 3 for 4 price on amazon.com . The robots and funny faces are a lot of fun. Probably best at 3-4-5 rather than 2 because the stickers are small.

I love all of the great not-licensed-character stuff by Dover.",5.0
"These little books are great! They are small, but perfect for birthday party favors, which is what we used them for! There is a blank page after each page of stickers, so that's where my kids made their robots. They were a huge hit!",5.0
"I was happy to find this little sticker book.  Inside were facial features & other stickers. The size was just right to use with a robot kit we had found .The grandson was very happy with the whole gift.

"This is a great book to throw in your bag to have while waiting in line or at a restaurant with a small, alternately bored and energetic,person. My 3-year-old loves that she can put together robots using different parts and create her own or match the pieces to the picture on the back cover. This is a very small book -really a pamphlet almost - which is the best part actually.",5.0

"I am using these little sticker books as party favors for my son's birthday partyl. He will have a robot party. These books complement the theme quite nicely.

Why buy cheap plastic toys as party favors? They will just end up broken and in the trash a couple of days later.

I enjoy these mini-Dover books. When the kids need a quiet activity, I pull them out. I carry couple of them with me in my purse/diaper bag. The kids will use them in restaurants or at church.",5.0
"My 5 year old son loves robots, and he really loved creating his own robots with this little Dover book. As always, these are high quality for the price. The Little Activity Books are small, and will get you through a waiting room visit, or a restaurant sitting, but not longer than that. They are worth their small cost though! Love it!",5.0
"... In a little package. My 6 year old loved making little robots with the stickers. I had originally got it to bump my order up to $25 to get free shipping, but I'm glad I got it. Now I want to get the other little sticker books from Dover for my son.",5.0

It is a fun little book for those of you that have someone that loves robots in your life. Fun for all ages.,5.0
"This occupied my almost-3 year old for nearly an hour.  Stickers were durable and easy to peel.  Afterwards, he kept going back to the box to see if there were more robot stickers to assemble in there.

I'll probably drop another dollar and buy it again for his Christmas stocking.  Three cheers for the short memory of a preschooler!",5.0
This kept my 3 year old son quite entertained whilst on a lengthy flight.  Recommend it for parents whose children are into robots,5.0
"This little Dover book is like the others of the series - fun and entertaining.  I was not happy to see that the price on the back was $1.50 and I paid $2.51 with Amazon.  I am used to getting a better deal than the stores, but this certainly was not!",5.0
"My 4 year old loves this robot sticker book! Yes, it is small, but its priced right for the size.  This provided lots of entertainment for my son, as he got to create his own robots.  He loves to intermix the parts and mis-matched robots. Definatly worth 1.50.",5.0
"I bought 8 of these for my 3 year old daughter's robot themed birthday party as favors for the little ones and it was a great hit! I didn't realize that the stickers were robot parts that the kids assemble themselves to create their own robots! That was a lot of fun and for the price, it was well worth it!",5.0
Perfect for that long airplane ride for my almost 6 year old son. Small enough to fit into my handbag. The stickers can be re-used over and over again to make new robots. A must for any busy mom!,5.0

fun stuff for the kid.. kind of messy but.. still lots of fun for them.. my kid is good at crafts so she made three dogs right away..,5.0
"My daughter is a huge fan of Klutz books and couldn't wait to get her hands on Pom-Pom Puppies. She made a Chihuahua, a Dalmation and a few mutts and they're getting cuter and cuter. The directions are really good (it can be challenging for an 8 year old to cut the yarn). I highly recommend this as a present to any kid who loves dogs, the results are really cute.",5.0
"My daughter just turned 6 and spotted this at a Scholastic book fair. I bought it for a birthday present, and so far we've made one puppy. It is definitely a collaborative effort at this age, though she can do a lot of the work -- trimming the pom poms, gluing, etc. The directions are clear, the photos are adorable and the materials are of good quality. We will definitely have to get more glue -- I think we've used half a tube on one project -- but I think it's just basic white school glue. So far, it's a big hit -- and fun for grown-ups, too!",5.0

"Really cute!!! My 9yr old and I have made lots of pom poms. Best of all, theres no mess to clean up and it could be done in the car, etc too.  Love it!",5.0
"I was skeptical, but my 9 year old has had so much fun with this kit and it was her favorite Christmas present.  She pretty much made the puppies herself with minimal help from me, though I did hot glue some ears rather than use the included glue.  Only downside is the cuttings can be messy, but really wonderful instructions, well-made supplies, and can be used for many years---and maybe even making different animals if you are creative.  Highly recommend for artsy, determined 9 year olds!  I actually want to try to make one myself they are so darn cute.",5.0
Very cute and very well designed. Makes adorable puppies.,5.0
Good stocking stuffer.,5.0
My 10 year old niece loved this!,5.0
"I purchased this for my niece's 6th birthday, after her mom told me she'd seen it in a store and been interested. This is definitely a craft that needs adult assistance. Even for a bit older kids (9-10) who might be able to handle all the instructions on their own, there are parts where it's just easier to have a second person to help interpret the directions as the other person does the steps. I helped make the first puppy-- we figured out the directions for making the pom-poms without too much difficulty. Getting it the right shape can take a bit of trial-and-error, but it ends up looking fine even if the ""legs"" aren't as distinct, etc. The puppies are not a super sturdy toy, since they are glued together, but are cute for gently play or as decorations. I'd probably give 4.5 stars if that was an option, just due to that and the directions being a little tricky at first.",5.0
Kids totally enjoyed making this. This is perfect for a rainy day stuck in the house.,5.0
kids had fun with it,5.0
"I purchased this so my kids could make gifts for others - and it turned out awesome.  So adorable, the brown puppy turned out the best for us.  It took a bit to get the hang of it, but went fast after they knew what they were doing.",5.0
"Easy enough to make, very adorable, but fragile, not good for little kids. I had to hot glue the head and body together, because they kept coming apart with the glue they give you. You can mix & match colors to make a dog however you'd like. My border collie is tri color so instead of black & white, I used all the colors they sent.",5.0

"A Christmas gift for my 8 y/o niece & totally by surprise her 11 y/o sister got the same exact one & she told me she had picked it out for herself.  On Christmas day she sat on the couch & began making a white fluffy poodle  I could tell she was really into it & enjoyed showing us what she did before we sat down for dinner. It was purely a coincidence that both of my grandnieces now have them.  They make really cute & cuddly dogs, they are soft & not difficult to construct. I would purchase it again & highly recommend it to anyone who has a young girl who enjoys doing crafts.",5.0
"My daughter got this for Christmas and it was the first thing she wanted to play with. She's nine and fairly adept at crafts, but she did need my help to work her way through the first puppy.  She was amazed when she compared the starting materials (a big shank of yarn), with her end result (a reasonably cute, puffy, chihuahua.) The quality of the yarn is better than I expected, and there is enough to make 4 good size puppies, plus tips on making others if you go buy supplies at the store on your own. It was a good purchase, it kept her attention for a long time and the parts were better quality than I thought we'd get.",5.0
"A really fun and creative craft!  This book is full of so many ideas - I especially like the different breeds and suggestions on how to use scrap yarn for spots, etc.  I wouldn't count on this being a craft that your child could do solo, unless they're a tween or older.  My six year-old and I just finished our first pup and it is now adorned in all of the included accessories - tiara, ribbons, and collar.",5.0
Fast shipment and great product.  So cute!,5.0
"If you're patient, they come out really cute!!! Not something a young child can do, so you definitely have to help if your child is under 8 or so.",5.0
"My 5 and 7 year old daughters received the Pom Pom Puppies book as a Christmas gift.  They were both able to wrap the yarn themselves and add their own touches to the puppies.  They are adorable.  The book is a big hit for my crafty, puppy-loving girls!",5.0
"Very cute,  fun project.  Wish there was more yarn and dog accessories",5.0
Something to put a smile on the face of my niece.,5.0
"My daughter is 8 and she loves this kit. We have made 3 puppies so far and they are pretty adorable. We made the Pomeranian, the Pug, and The Scottie. We had some trouble with the heads falling off - saw in another comment they used a hot glue gun, we'll try that next. It is surprising how distinctive each breed looks! She says, ""They're awesome! And they're adorable! And they take a long time to make!""",5.0

great service...fun book to create with my ten year old granddaughter.  Thanks!,5.0
"Just as described,",5.0
"Agree with most of the reviewers.  Lovely craft for adults or for children with the help of the adults:) Most children will not be able to make the puppies without the help.  Love Klutz crafts.  Always a lot of fun! the Yorkie was made by me and the white dog was made by my DD with my help.  The head of both can turn :) Very Cute!  (Sew the head and the eyes!)
Update: Made another puppy- poodle.  Used all of my own materials except the eyes.  The thread was much thinner-resulting in a smaller puppy.  Verdict-you can use thinner thread but I believe the results are not as nice-will try to find thicker thread next time. Used hot glue-easy and strong.",5.0

"As an adult crafter who likes simple projects to relieve stress, I enjoyed this product very much, even though there are a few minor flaws. I'll list some pros, cons, and suggestions below.

Pros:
The book provides detailed directions for seven different dog breeds in addition to abbreviated suggestions for how to create an unlimited number of breeds on your own.
Book directions are clear and detailed with large, accurate pictures.
The pompom maker is sturdy and easy to use. I had no problem creating pompoms easily my first try.
The kit comes with enough basic supplies to make four adorable puppies, provided you take yarn measurements into account
I was very satisfied with how cute my puppies turned out!

Cons:
The basic school glue provided was not strong enough to hold the heads to the bodies or the felt ears to the heads.
The punch-out dog carriers were too small for all of my pups.
The kit is probably a bit too challenging for most eight-year-olds. I'd recommend it for ages ten and up.
While there is enough yarn provided to make four dogs, there is not enough to make any four you want. Some dogs require too much yarn if you want to create four dogs total.
The measuring tape on the back of the book measures in inches and centimeters, while the book directions are in yards.

Suggestions:
Use a hot glue gun to hold the dog together. I used superglue, but my puppies are a little fragile.
Take yarn measurements into account when choosing pups or just buy more yarn at a craft store.
If you wrap the yarn around the height of the book, you'll have half a yard of yarn. Use this cheat mentioned in the book instead of the confusing ruler.
When the book says to cut the yarn short, be sure to cut it quite short or your pup might look a little messy and shaggy.

Overall I really liked this kit and would definitely recommend it.",5.0
My kid LOVES this! Kept her busy for days as she loves anything she can craft.,5.0
Huge hit with my crafty 8 year old for Christmas!,5.0
My 8 year old daughter received this for Christmas.  She made four beautiful puppies from the kit and and continue to make more by just buying more yarn.  Instructions are easy to follow and with a little help she was able to make them herself.,5.0

Cute. Great craft for my little girl,5.0
My daughter put this in the closet and forgot about it for a year.  After finally convincing her that she would like this we pulled it out and she loved it.  At 9.5 she did not feel comfortable making on her own so I was very involved.  You need very sharp scissors- ours were not and it makes is much more difficult.  The dogs we made came out really adorable and it took a good long time to make them.  She was very excited about them and wants to buy more yarn.  I think this would be perfect for a 10 or 11 year old because of the time and skill involved.,5.0

"Got it on time, it's good gift.kids like it.
I will recommend to my friends too.
I'll buy more too.",5.0
I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and we BOTH had so much fun doing it. There's so much more you can make beyond the book!,5.0
"Got this for my five-year-old who was looking for a craft book and chose it because she thinks the puppies are cute. It is maybe a touch old for her: she needed someone to model it for her the first couple of times and still requires a little help here and there, but she caught on pretty quickly, and if her own pom-poms aren't as tight and neatly trimmed as the pictures (or Mom's), so what? She is having a great time with it, and so are Mom and big sister.

The instructions and photos are pretty easy to follow and the kit comes with enough yarn to make 3 or 4 pups. After that, you need to go get some more, but I didn't expect it to come with its own Michaels attached.

Adult crafters will likely find this unchallenging, and younger kids, like my 5 year-old will, likely need some help, at least initially, but for anybody in between - if this looks like fun for you, it very probably will be.",5.0
My almost 9 Year Old loves this pom-pom puppy kit!  She can do it independently and create adorable puppies.  We did have to use hot glue to get the body pieces to stay together.,5.0
"A friend of my daughters was making these pups and selling at a kids craft fair. My daughter was intrigued and wanted it for Christmas. We have already made three dogs. The instructions are clear, the photos are great.  I did think ahead and by more yarn which was a good thing because it does only come with a small starter collection of yarn. ( which I expect  with this type of book...I figure I am paying for the guide and any materials it comes with is a bonus!)
My daughter is 10 years old and very crafty. I would suspect a younger child may need assistance. Oh and it does provide fun math practice when measuring the yarn!!! Enjoy!",5.0
"This kit is AWESOME! My 5-year old daughter and I made the chihuahua dog first, and it came out looking exactly like the picture. Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!

The book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.

My daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.

One thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!

We made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.

Pros:
Great, easy directions
Nice supplies in the kit
Variety - you can make so many types of dogs!
Fun project to do with your kids
The finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals
Kids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives
Lots of room for creativity
You can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store
Price - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store
Amazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great
This kit would make an awesome present for any young girl!

Cons:
The glue: this kit is a lot more fun if you invest in a hot glue gun
More money :) if you love this kit as much as we do, you'll end up spending a lot more in the craft store to keep going with it!

I hope you have as much fun with this project as we have!",5.0
"I'm a mental health therapist that works with kids, many of whom have anger control issues. All kids love playing Uno and this is essentially Uno with anger control tips to learn along the way. Although I felt that 20.00 was a little expensive for a card game, it's gotten more than its fair share of use. It's great to start conversation with kids who just want to play a game and aren't super interested in talking. I even had one of my clients ask his mom to buy the game so they could play at home. My one complaint is that the cards are very big! It's hard for a lot of my kids to actually hold the cards since they're like supersized playing cards.",5.0
"These are great for clients who struggle with how to control their anger.  It is actually very similar to another card game, UNO.  However, it has definite therapeutic value, as half of the cards have questions, suggestions, and activities to cope with anger.",5.0
"In the mental health field,.this is a great item to use to teach anger management and kids of all ages loves it",5.0
Really good for working with children with anger issues and a fun game that children will enjoy playing with an adult.,5.0
"This is a great game for talking about anger and having fun at the same time. My son, who is 5, gets angry very easily and usually does not want to talk about it. When playing this game, he was more than willing to talk about his anger and ways to help control it. He loves playing this game! There was actually improvement in his self control after the first day that we played it. I was pleasantly surprised. Much recommended!",5.0
"This game is really simple yet surprisingly effective in helping kids learn basic anger control strategies. I use it with 8- and 9-year-olds, and they do seem to retain and use the anger control techniques it teaches. It's an inexpensive way to help kids manage their impulses and get at least some control over their emotions.",5.0
"This game is basically UNO, but with fun ""how to control emotions"" suggestions on about half of the cards. It's a great way to have fun and relax with your kiddo and occasionally bring up anger-management ideas in a non-stressful way.",5.0
Im a behavioral health counselor at an intermediate school and play this game with my students. The kids love this game because it is played like Uno. There are plenty of opportunities to answer simple yet meaningful questions that help kids with anger.,5.0

"This is a great resource for kids to help with their anger.  I'm a therapist and use it with my adolescent clients.  The kids love that it's a game, similar to Uno, and I love it because it's teaching them skills.",5.0
"different, kids had red faces, not sure they like",5.0
Clients enjoy it!  The card questions have brought up good discussions and insight.,5.0
Wonderful tool for use when working with children with anger management symptoms/diagnoses.,5.0
"Used in sessions. Just like playing UNO (which most children know how to play already), so the child jumps right into the game. The fact that not every card has a prompt on it makes it feel like a card game with questions; as oppose to a psychoeducation lesson with cards. I use about 3/4 of the deck (there are a lot of cards) which means that you will not go through all the prompts in one session. Highly recommended.",5.0
"So I work as a mental health clinician in a locked facility with adolescents who have some anger issues due to experiencing ALOT of trauma. They also have to deal with really really stupid rules, which triggers both them and myself. I'd say they are at ages 6-12, when it comes to controlling anger. With that said, this game was a lot of fun during session and in anger reduction group. It's just like UNO with some anger control techniques and talking points thrown in! I love it and am extremely happy I bought this. It is so much fun and helps my adolescents talk about their anger and reframe that anger in a positive way!",5.0
Great game to play for children and any other people that has anger issues.,5.0
The game was received really well by my kids. The adult facilitation helped a lot.,5.0
I have played this game with quite a few clients already and so far it is going well. The cards are made well too which is important for someone who will need to get a lot of use out of them.,5.0
"I use this game with children and families. It is very helpful for helping people to open up about feelings, especially anger. So far have used this with ages 5 and up, with great results.",5.0
I used this game a lot when I was doing in home therapy w/ kids. It's a great nonthreatening way to introduce topics and touch on some skills.,5.0

I love this game for my therapy sessions. Clients love it too. It's a great way to teach anger management skills in a fun way.,5.0
This is one of my top go to games during my social work sessions with kids.,5.0
It's really helping my ADD'R learn to discuss his anger constructively,5.0
"I am a social worker on an inpatient psychiatric unit for children and adolescents. This game is easy for all ages to play, and while some of the scenarios/questions are a little simplistic, it gives the kiddos a safe way to express different ways to handle anger. When playing with mixed ages or ability levels, I have found that the younger kids often push the older kids to think harder about their answers and give options to them for responses. I love using it in my groups, and almost everyone can use a little help with anger management!",5.0
this is a fantastic game great questions. Kids do need to be able to read to make it go smoother,5.0
great,5.0
"I use this with my elementary students in counseling.  It is enough like Uno that the kids catch on quickly, but also get the benefit of therapeutic interventions.",5.0
"I really like this game, it helps kids recognize anger and talk about difficult emotions.",5.0
"The game is basically Uno with discussion cues on some of the cards. It can take a long time for someone to win the game too...

Our daughter has been having anxiety and getting angry easily lately. We noticed she's been going to the red zone of anger so quickly that there isn't time to calm down and talk through what's been upsetting her. Even after she calmed down she didn't want to talk about it. The day Mad Dragon arrived, we all sat down and played it before bed. She started opening up about all the things that have been bothering her and we get to tell her about similar instances when we were growing up. We love that it also reminds her about ways to keep calm and why it's better than getting angry. Once in a while she'll tell us how she didn't get mad at school like the Mad Dragon! She asks to play it every night- so she clearly enjoys the game.",5.0
Good game--like Uno but with meaningful (therapy) content.,5.0
I like how this game helps build emotional management/conflict resolution skills while adding a play aspect. My students seem to enjoy it.,5.0
love it,5.0
Great resource for BHIS care coordinators!! Works well with kids and teens on what it says it does!!,5.0
kids LOVE this !,5.0
"If you know how to play Uno, then you basically know how to play this game. On some of the cards, there are questions that help children recognize body sensations when they are angry, problem solve what they can do if something starts to upset them and gives them tools to use. 100 cards in the deck. My six year old wants to play this every single night and this game is helping him with emotional regulation. My 8 year old likes the game too, but doesn't always want to answer the questions (depending on how his day has gone). If you are looking for a fun way to help teach the children in your life tools for emotional regulation, I highly recommend this game!",5.0
Using in one-on-one or family therapy sessions. The kids love it. Just like Uno.,5.0
"Great, fun game as an ice-breaker or group activity!

Great family game addition for child that struggles with self-control/anger.,5.0
"Satisfied, thanks",5.0
Love it,5.0
I'm a mental health clinician who works in schools. This game is played just like uno and my children love the game. I usually have then read the question and we both answer the questions. I usually go first to give the kids an idea of how to answer just in case they are stumped. This game prepares the child to know how to defeat anger and to lets them know that they are essentially in control of their anger.,5.0
"This game is great- the students ask to play it over and over.  It gets them talking much more than if I would just ask them the questions and if they are hesitant, I will answer the question honestly and model that it is ok to be honest.",5.0
good therapy tool,5.0
Easy-to-use great for anger management groups,5.0
"I love this game!! I bought this for my seven year old son who has anger issues and trouble identifying/explaining  other emotions in others or himself.  He started out being really excited to play a new game, but then it kept on talking about anger (the point of the game) he became frustrated -imagine that!  After a couple games and seeing that it is like Uno and sharing feelings isn't so bad he started to warm up.
I would highly recommend this game!!",5.0
"This game plays like UNO, but is more interactive and opens the way for players to share their thoughts and feelings about experiences.  I work with children and families in a variety of therapy settings and this game has helped open up dialogue in a way that is fun.  I have seen shy children that had a difficult time talking about their inner selves begin to open up and talk freely.  Great game and one of my favorites!",5.0
Excellent for children/adolescents with anger issues.  The game assists with developing problem-solving techniques and rationalizing.  I found that client's of all ages really enjoy playing it!,5.0
"My clients love it, arrived quickly",5.0
"This game is more fun and easier to understand than I had anticipated. (Rules are basically the same as Uno) I thought I would have to 'sell it to my students in 1st/2nd grade Resource, but they really enjoyed it and everyone had an answer for the questions posed along the way. It also encouraged my better readers to help others and share examples when they needed help 'getting it'.

I would recommend to any resource/ SpEd teacher working with social skills or behavior modifications.",5.0
Used this with several families already. The families have said they found it helpful and the questions to be easy to understand and answer.,5.0
I play these all the time with my young teenage clients.  They love it!,5.0
"This is a must have resource for any children's therapist. The game plays like UNO, so the children pick it up easily, and the questions prompt discussions regarding effective anger management skills. I use this game with kids of all ages- even the teenagers don't shy away because they enjoy the competitive nature of the game itself.",5.0
Very good game! My kids love it! The game is very similar to uno except with questions corresponding to anger and coping skills for anger. Much more pricey than some games but well worth the money.,5.0
Excellent product to use with my clients with anger issues.,5.0
My clients love this game !,5.0
Really better than expected!  Thank you so much for your speedy professional service,5.0
Great game for therapy sessions,5.0
"This is a fun game for kids. It's basically the game of Uno, but each card has thoughtful, age-appropriate questions about what happens when we get angey, managing anger in ourselves, what happens when others get angry, and the experience of anger in our bodies!  It's especially good for the younger kids that haven't ever thought about these things and don't necessarily understand their own feelings of anger!",5.0
Great game!!! Wonderful for talking about emotions and attitudes. Using experiences was very helpful. My 9 year old loved it,5.0
"I am a licensed clinical social worker and use this game a lot in therapy with kids who have difficulty managing their anger. The game is straightforward and assists in starting the conversation of how to handle anger, or to strengthen skills. I recommend this game for any child struggling to manage emotions appropriately. It uses language so that therapists, teachers or parents can all utilize it with children. Love this game!",5.0
"Very fun game to use with kids working on handling anger.  You play like Uno, but have to answer questions about anger.",5.0
I like this game for reinforcing previously learned anger management techniques. It will not stand only as the only thing that will teach children anger management skills but kids seem to have fun with it. And since it's played like Uno most are familiar with the rules already. I have used this for lower functioning adults as well.,5.0
"Game is fun, but can be very long",5.0
This is working great and it arrived on time.,5.0
"Great to use with kids who need support with self-regulation and social skills. It can be adapted and played in many different ways, depending on the age group.",5.0
"This is a good game to use even up into middle school.  The kids hardly know they are even doing more than playing the game.  The game can be slow or fast depending on how often you read the cards and do what they say.  It offers the opportunity to do a lot of processing about anger and think about potential situations where you may be dealing with anger and what you should do.  In a group, it leads to a lot of discussions.",5.0
I am a school social worker and use this game with 4th-8th graders.,5.0
Great Seller!!! Happy with my purchase!!! 5 starrrr,5.0
This is a great anger management game for kiddos and adults alike!,5.0
"My husband is a therapist and I came across these cards and suggested he give them a try in some of his sessions. I can't answer first hand since I'm not actually the one that uses them, but he said they really grasp the kids attention and makes his therapy sessions easier. He has group sessions with high school kids, and he said the kids that normally won't talk during his sessions really opened up with these cards. He is amazed at how well they work.",5.0
"I work with a broad range of kids K-6, many of whom have autism or learning disabilities in addition to emotional challenges and mental health problems. They LOVE Mad Dragon and will ask for it by name when I offer a non-therapeutic game like Uno. This is FANTASTIC for my kids with learning disabilities because they help each other read and process the cards and feel empowered and successful when they play. One started playing this with his younger brother and was so excited to work through the questions with him WITHOUT MY HELP. I don't know how I've survived at work for this long without Mad Dragon. I'll never go without it again!",5.0
My kids love love love this game. Wonderful anger tools & self awareness of their anger as well. It's played like bingo with questions in the cards. I find it's great for my clients ages 6-12.,5.0
"Helpful in my practice.  The questions are a little long for some of the younger, or less focused ones.",5.0

We are able to have so much fun with it, but at the same time really are able to focus in on issues of anger; which many of my kiddos struggle with. As a school based therapist, I definitely recommend this !!",5.0

Great therapeutic game.,5.0

"This is a fun card game for helping youth talk about anger and coping... played similar to UNO, some of the cards have questions which the players answer when they play the card.",5.0
"I purchased this game to use with children in a mental health setting.  Many have been abused and most have had some exposure with foster care or child protective services.  I LOVE this game.  Previous reviewers commented on the size being a bit large and I agree. I even have trouble holding them.  The cards are repetitive and when the client comments about this, we have a discussion about how we sometimes get angry about the same thing so the cards are giving us the chance to come up with many ways to handle the same situation. I also use the cards with the parents and children.  This has been very valuable when the children see their parents admit their behavior is not always appropriate and they are working on their own anger.  I have combined this game with deep breathing.  They are getting rid of the ""Dragon's Breath"" as they exhale.  The kids love it and the parents can prompt them to practice the skill by j saying Dragon's Breath.",5.0
"I use this game on a daily basis with kids of all ages. The game plays just like UNO and the skills are easy for kids and teens to learn and use at home, in school, or out in public. I would recommend this game for anyone working with kids or teens with anger management issues.",5.0
I like that is plays out like uno which my eight year old son loves the only thing is when we are playing I have to have him put down his cards when we have a reading card cause he eager to keep playing and won't pay attention or rush the discussion card,5.0
I have used this in my groups (with 1st through 5th graders) and they love it. It is especially useful in one of my 3rd grades groups because they learn the anger strategies AND they have to practice playing cooperatively with others. It is also simple enough for the students to learn.,5.0
It is like UNO but focused on anger and coping skills. It has been a wonderful tool that i have used with the k-5 kids I work with. You can always play a simple UNO game and not use the questions. It is great to have!,5.0
"I do in-home therapy with children with serious emotional disturbances. This quickly became a favorite of most of my clients and families, even over standard Uno. I've also learned a lot about various clients and siblings by looking at which cards they refuse to play. I would love to see more of these, dealing with different emotions and behaviors.",5.0
"Great game that kids love to play, it's like Uno so most kids know how to play it already. Recommend.",5.0
This is a nice fast paced game that I've used with kids from ages 8 to 14.  The younger kids seem to really get a lot out of playing.,5.0
"I'm a child therapist, and I work with lots of children and adolescents with anger. This card game has become a favorite in therapy sessions. It's full of really good questions, and I've even had several children request that we play this game. This anger control game has become a reward for some clients because it is such a hit.",5.0
This game is great!  It has lots of ideas to help kids control their anger and understand the potential consequences of their anger.  It plays like Uno but requires the kids to answer questions.  I use it in my counseling practice.  I wish there were more great games like this for kids.  They get to play a fun game and learn some valuable skills.,5.0
THIS IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH KIDS OF DIFFERENT AGES. IT REALLY HELPS THEM TO OPEN UP WHILE THEY ARE HAVING FUN,5.0
My 5yr old twin boys are having difficulty controlling their emotions.  This game has really helped open up the discussion in a fun way.  The game is simple like 'Uno'....and the pictures make it fun for them to play.  During the game the questions on the cards help us to teach important lessons about controlling temper.,5.0
"This card game is easy to play, fun, and an engaging way to teach children about anger. The durable and vibrant cards and box will last a long time. Definitely recommended!",5.0
My son is 8 and he loves this game - it plays just like Uno! It is a great way to teach appropriate ways to handle his anger and empower him.  I would definitely recommend it!,5.0
"As a therapist-in-training I was looking for games to use with clients that were reasonably priced. I really like this game because it plays just like Uno and I can teach anger management skills to kids and teens while we're having fun. Even though it's geared towards kids I find that if I'm honest about the cards being a little silly for their age the teens will play the game because most people don't mind playing Uno no matter what their age. Its also a good way to help the parents talk to their kids about their expectations around appropriate ways to express anger, and the parents can learn new skills as well.",5.0
I am a therapist for children and this game is so valuable to bring out insight and solutions to deal with and identify feelings of anger. I use it frequently.,5.0

"What a fabulous idea!  I tripped across this product just the other day and had to have it for our family!!!  I'm always trying to incorporate God and His message into our daily lives, and with Easter coming up, what a great way to learn the Easter story and share the Easter story.  Our daughter is almost 7 years old, and I know she'll love these nesting eggs.  It's a perfect visual to go along with the story.

As mentioned by the creator, the nesting eggs are hard to get apart at first, but when instructions are followed, getting them apart is easy.  No twisting, but gentle rocking back and forth helped me get them apart.  Then I practiced a few times.  The more you use them (take apart, put back together), the easier it becomes.

I cannot wait to start this new tradition in a few weeks!  Pretty sure we'll be getting the nativity scene and Christmas story from this creator, too!",5.0
Precious and perfect way to read through the story of Jesus' death and resurrection with the kiddos. Hands on which they loved!,5.0
"Quality of the eggs excellent.  Did have to let them release some of the moisture before I could open, however, they all opened without damage.  Book is well illustrated.",5.0
"We purchased the Star From Afar few years ago, and were excited to see the Easter Story Egg come out this year.  The hardcover book is beautifully written in rhyme and verse with seven short stories of Holy Week from Palm Sunday through Easter.  The seven wooden nesting eggs correspond to each story with beautiful illustrations.  As the Star From Afar is a great family tradition to ""follow the Star"" for the Advent Season, the Easter Story Egg is a great addition for your family to remind us of the true meaning of Easter.",5.0
"I am so excited to have found the Easter Story Egg! I was looking for a Christ centered tradition to help my boys understand the true meaning of the Easter holiday when I came across the Easter Story Egg. We are all looking forward to reading each of the seven stories, opening the corresponding eggs and explaining the significance this Easter. The hardbound book and wooden eggs are high quality, and I look forward to many years of this meaningful tradition with my boys.",5.0
"We were SOOO excited to see the EASTER Story Egg come out this year!  We were given the Star from Afar a few years ago from my in-laws and have LOVED adding that tradition to our family Christmas celebration! We have bought it as gifts for others, as it has really helped us teach our kids the true meaning of Christmas and focus on Jesus during the busy holiday season.
The Easter Story Egg does not disappoint!  There is no doubt it will be a fun way to help us keep Jesus at the heart of our Easter celebrations, as well.  We just got our nesting eggs and book a few days ago and our kids (ages 5, 3, and even the 1 year old) couldn't have been more excited!  It was so fun for them to pull apart the eggs (a little difficult for them to open and close at first, but as promised, much easier to for them to do after a few days of playing with them!) They seem to be holding up well to their semi-rough handling, as they are solid wood, though I have tried to the limit the play so they're still new and exciting to use at Easter!
As with the Star from Afar, the art is simple, but beautiful, and clearly illustrates the message for my pre-readers.  The 7 mini-stories, matching each of the nesting eggs and intended to be read one a day from Palm Sunday through Easter, are told through original poetry in a quality hard cover book.  I appreciate that there is a Bible verse with each days story, as I can use that verse as a place to start in our daily Bible reading or choose one as a memory verse for my kids during the Easter week.  Needless to say, were super excited to start our new tradition this Easter with our Easter Story Egg! I would recommend this product to anyone with kids of any age!",5.0
"We love The Easter Story Egg! The hardcover book has beautiful, colorful illustrations and seven short stories. The wooden nesting eggs also have lovely illustrations that correspond with each story. We sat down right away and read through each of the stories and my kids took turns opening each egg. Initially some the eggs were hard to open but now they open and close easily. My kids continue to ask me to read the book to them and to play with the eggs. I purchased The Star From Afar a few years ago and it has become a Christmas tradition in our house to follow the star. I know The Easter Story Egg is going to be another great tradition!

There are not many products like this. It is such a fun and meaningful activity. I love that it helps my children understand the true meaning of Easter.",5.0
"My children have enjoyed The Star From Afar so much at Christmas, that we were wildly anticipating the arrival of our Easter Story Egg.  And of course, it did not disappoint!  The moment it arrived, my kids were thrilled to open the box and look at each egg's beautiful artwork.  As my children were admiring and playing with the eggs, I began reading the book to them.  They loved each story....and loved that each egg matched up to a story in the book.  The Easter Story Egg is beautifully written.  It is a series of 7 short short stories in one hardbound book.  The stories are written in beautiful rhyme and verse, and do a great job explaining the events leading up to Easter.  My kids really enjoyed the visual of the last egg, which is the stone, that is rolled away....and when its opened it is empty!!! What a great visual for my young children to understand the meaning of Easter.  I am very much looking forward to using this product as Easter approaches....and I know that it will be a new tradition in our home.  We have given so many new families The Star From Afar for baptisms, birthdays and Christmas and I will be adding this my favorite gifts to give to young ones too.  Another amazing product by Natalie Ard, hoping there is more to come!!!!",5.0
"We have now used this product for two consecutive Easters and it is one of our favorite new traditions!  This activity keeps the attention of both of my children, who are 7 years apart in age.  The first year, we had a problem with a couple of the eggs (one wouldn't open and one wouldn't close) but the company was fabulous and immediately sent us a replacement set.  Some of the points made in the poem don't align perfectly with our family's theological beliefs, so I did change a few of the words to more closely reflect what we want to teach our children.  The eggs are beautiful and we look forward to enjoying this tradition for years to come!",5.0
A beautiful and sentimental gift. I plan to order 2 more sets for gifts.,5.0
Wonderful product,5.0
"A beautiful story, wonderfully written.  A classic tradition for Easter.",5.0
"LOVE this! It is so hard to find Easter items that aren't just bunnies and candy and actually pertain to the real reason for Easter. This explains Easter really well for kids. It rhymes plus has a quote from scripture for each day from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday. It's like an advent calendar for Holy Week. I know this will be a GREAT tradition at our house each year. The eggs are a little hard to open, but the website from the company that makes it and the box it's packaged in both say it's normal and gets easier over time. The box is also very nice for storing it the rest of the year. And it's the best children's Easter book I've found that actually explains Easter really well for kids. My twin 4 year olds get really excited to open each egg every day but it's great for my 8 year old too! And I like that it sits out as a reminder for what Easter is really about.",5.0
"A very unique way to share the Easter Story - the nesting eggs are a really nice addition that makes the story more ""tangible"".",5.0
"This is such a nice Easter gift. Although they are a little pricey, I sent one to all 4 of my Godchildren, since I loved how it told the Easter Story, which can be a little tricky.

Unfortunately, my 3 year old lost the top of one of the eggs, but besides that, it's perfect!",5.0
"Wow! This product is incredible! I was hesitant to purchase due to the price, but the teachable moments with my little boy are PRICELESS! The eggs are perfect quality and the story is illustrated simply and beautifully to teach the TRUE meaning of Easter! This easily held the attention of my 3 year old and made his mommy emotional. This beautiful memorial to the Easter holiday will certainly be treasured as a new tradition in our home. Thank you to the artist and author!",5.0
I love this!!! My kids truly enjoy the experience and has really brought Easter back to what is was meant to be. Highly recommend. And I have 2 boys - 13 & 9. Both love it.,5.0
I really like the wood nesting egg to tell the resurrection story to children. It doesnt give too much information making it perfect. The book that goes with it is hard cover and is written in simple language. The pictures on the eggs are simple and nice. Im very happy with my purchase. It is so much nicer than the plastic resurrection eggs that I also purchased.,5.0

"I love this so much! It is such a fun and special way to celebrate Easter.
The first Easter story egg I received was damaged a little bit, but I sent it back and received a perfect one!
I am so excited to use this so soon!",5.0
"The 7-year-old loved the nesting eggs. I liked the story. However, the length of the ""story"" for the individual eggs was too much for her attention span. That the last egg (the stone blocking the tomb) opened up to be empty was shocking and exhilarating at the same time. Ha. One of our eggs developed a hairline crack after the first reading, and the eggs was graciously and willingly replaced by seller. I loved the careful attention to wordsmithing on the author's part; word choice was excellent. However, the book needed a good editing. All in all, this product is wonderful for the Easter season.",5.0

"I just used the Easter Story Egg with my Sunday school grade 1-3 class and it went very well. It kept the attention of the children including 2 special needs students. I didn't use the book that comes with it. The book is illustrated and has a well written rhyming story line. I felt each section was too long to read. Also sometimes with rhyming stories the sentence construction is awkward for kids to understand since it is worded to allow for phrases to rhyme.  I could see that in a family setting one could read it and stop to talk about it. I'm very experienced as a story teller so I used each part of the egg to tell the story myself with children supplying facts from their own knowledge. I also made a strip of paper for each child with 8 eggs each smaller than the first and labeled with the days of the week and one word for each day. Sunday- Praise God and children put a palm leaf sticker on the egg, Monday- Respect God, children used a glue stick to add a small picture of the temple I had printed form clip art, Tuesday Love like Jesus did, a heart sticker, Wednesday- offer your best, rubbed a spice scent lip balm on it, Thursday- Remember Jesus added a small clip art picture of the last supper, Friday- Forgiven a cross sticker and for Saturday and Sunday the phrase Jesus rose from the dead. The Saturday egg children colored gray and Sunday left blank. At first the eggs were very hard to take apart. I left them apart for a few days , put them together and apart two more times and they were easy to use after that. Be sure to pull not twist.",5.0
This is a great way to show your kids what Easter is really about! My kids loved seeing what was inside each day after we read the story. The hand carved wood smells so good inside.,5.0
We used this for the week proceeding Easter and our kids looked forward to seeing what was in the next egg every night. It is a lovely tradition that instills the true meaning of Easter.,5.0
"Beautiful set!  I originally ordered this with my almost 4-yr-old granddaughter in mind, however, I will tuck it away and save for a couple of years.  Although the eggs could be played with now and I could explain each one at her level, the story is beyond her comprehension.

Also, as described on the box and in an email from the company, the wooden eggs were new, and needed a few days to dry out and become accustomed to the lower humidity level in our home. I carefully opened each egg, per instructions, and set them out.  At the time, I wondered if I should put the eggs back together to dry, or leave them apart.  When I tried to put the eggs back together a few days later, one egg just wouldn't fit together.  I emailed the company right away, and two days later, received a replacement.  I notice the updated instructions now say to ""Please take the eggs out of the nesting position and re-close them separately to dry.""",5.0
Love this book and the beautiful eggs.  This book will definitely be a tradition in our house every year.,5.0
"Have never seen anything like this story-the eggs are absolutely gorgeous--detailed paintings on each are well done. I am a Christian preschool teacher and I have read it to 3's, 4's and 5's--all have loved the eggs! Also a mom of two elementary aged children and they love it, too! Thank you--highly recommend this book to add to your Easter collection!",5.0
So gorgeous and love the rhyming in the book.  Perfect way to teach my kids why Easter is so special!,5.0
"Very nice set of nesting eggs and the story that goes with them, or the story that has the eggs to go with it.  Either way, this is a great item.  I wish I had ordered more, as they are now out of stock, and others are requesting them.  If they become available again, I will be purchasing more!",5.0
"Larger than I expected and absolutely beautiful!  I will be using it this week with my students at school.  I know they will love it, and then I plan to enjoy it at home.  Thank you!  Beautifully made, and I appreciate the instructions about how to gently open it the first time.",5.0
"We had received the Star from Afar set a few years ago and love being able to share the true meaning of important holidays with our girls, on a level they can relate to.

When we saw The Easter Story Egg come out we knew we wanted to purchase, so we could explain the true meaning of Easter as well.

The eggs are well made, the wood is smooth, and good quality without splinters. The painted images on each one were nice and vibrant. The eggs themselves are a good size as well, easy for an adult to hold, and my 4yr old had no issues.  The book we received is good quality as well, no binding issues like another reviewer mentioned.

The packaging for this product is great as well, it all stores nicely in the box when not in use throughout the year.

Our girls were very excited to receive it in the mail recently and we can't wait to use it.

Very pleased with this product!",5.0
"The eggs and the book are lovely, and the eggs appear to be very durable. Am looking forward to using them with our little ones!",5.0
"Excited to start this new tradition. The pictures in the book perfectly match the eggs, so it's easy for kids to follow along.",5.0
Beautiful! We look forward to The Easter Story Egg being a regular Easter tradition! Great quality that will last through the years.,5.0
"LOVE the Easter Story Egg! Such a great way to celebrate and remember Easter and what Jesus did for us! The book and eggs are beautiful and are a great way to teach children about the days leading up to Jesus' death and resurrection. Also, the customer service fro Star From Afar Kids is EXCELLENT! We had an issue and contacted them by email. They were quick to respond and wonderful in helping us! Will recommend The Easter Story Egg to everyone I know!",5.0
"I bought this for my 3 year old (and some of the pieces would be too small for any child under that age), and she loves it...but entertainingly, so did I and quite a few people at work (all of us 30+), as we had no self control and had to open it up and play with it for a little bit before I gave it to her (uh, to ""test"" it out).  It is a lot of fun to play with either on your own or with someone else - trying to architect the house together.  This one and the cupcake/bakery set are really both adorable - and my daughter has sustained an interest in both for a long time.  We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.  (I just bought this house one recently, but I assume it will be a similar fascination).  One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.  I really do recommend this - especially to bring to restaurants or on a plane (or maybe for an older kid, the car - but I know we would lose the pieces if I gave it to my 3 year old while driving!).  This would be fun for both girls and boys.",5.0
"This set is in a convenient box and has many many little detailed pieces. My 4 year old loves designing different types of houses! There are even great little pets that hang out in the windows and on the porches! My kiddo loves letting the pets roam around the yard and check out all the features she places, which leads me to think she'd really love more living creatures to inhabit these places. This would be a great travel toy because you can't play with it unless it's in the box. Everything sticks in there. The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with, but there are only 2 cards front and back, and they all fit inside the box, so you can only really look at one at a time, 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge. Not a big deal, but just a little crowded when trying to play.",5.0
"We have several different sets of these magnetic toys.  They are self contained--no small parts all over the floor, very portabke and giid for many",5.0
"This is a very cute puzzle and I love the zipper bag for storage.  Our puzzles in boxes always seem to get destroyed and pieces get lost, but these bags make cleaning up and storage easier.",5.0
"If your little one loves puzzles and this is in her age level, these pouch puzzles are the best thing I have found to take along. Flat, fairly small, light and uses a good amount of time to put together.",5.0
"Such great quality, easy to put together because of the thick, well made pieces. My 2.5-3 year old LOVES them and can do these 12 piece puzzles by herself.",5.0
"Again, a great price for a puzzle.  The best part is the carrying case.  You can take it with you without worrying about losing pieces.",5.0
My son is 2.5 years old and was getting bored with the shape in a hole puzzles. So I got some starter jigsaw puzzles (12 pieces or so.) While he also likes the Melissa and Doug puzzles he loves the Mudpuppy puzzles so much more. For one they have bigger pieces so they are much easier to manipulate. Also the other poster is right that each piece has a referential on it so that it's easy for him to figure out how it goes together completely on his own.,5.0
My son is 2 years and 4 months.  He is a little advanced for his age on puzzles because he really enjoys doing them and practices.  He can actually do this puzzle on his own which is great for a 12 piece jigsaw puzzle.  The pieces are so well made and it has a picture he can refer to while he is building.  Love this puzzle and the dinosaur one as well.  I plan to buy some more of these if they have them!,5.0
"A great puzzle for my 3.5 year old. I have bought a few of the puzzles in this series, and they are a great jigsaw starter puzzle. The pieces are easy to manipulate, and there aren't too many. It is easy for them to finish (with a bit of help). The pictures are vibrant (and non-commercial, which is a plus). The zippered pouches work well too.",5.0
"Love the Mudpuppy pouch puzzles! My children keep up with the puzzle since there is a pouch. It's very easy to take along in a bag or backpack. Very good quality, will buy more.",5.0

My little one is happy to learn with this beautiful Alphabet letters,5.0
"The ""sweet"" pattern is absolutely adorable!  I plan on purchasing a set of matching lower case letters and numbers. The magnets are very well made, and I don't foresee any of the coated paper peeling off.  The manufacturer indicates this product is for years three and up. We are using them for decoration out of our toddler's reach until then. However, she grabs them every time she sees them. She loves the print and colors, too!",5.0

We were able to write a message from Santa on the board for a super cute presentation! The box was pretty banged up, but Amazon made it right. Though these are a little pricey, I think they were worth the splurge!",5.0
My daughter loves these. They stick to my fridge very well. They are light enough for her tiny 1 year old hands to pull on and off yet song enough to stay on when the door is opened a hundred times a day.,5.0
My 9 month old daughter loves these. I put them on my dishwasher and she stands there and plays with them.  They are a very pretty soft pastel pattern which I love because they don't stand out as an eye sore.,5.0
great for my 5 yr old,5.0
"I was hesitant to purchase these because some reviews said they were basically paper and fell apart easily. This was not the case with the magnets I received. They are really hard embossed wood/cardboard type material. My toddler has used these for a month, chewing on them, scattering them around the house, and they are still going strong. I'm really happy with these magnets and i will probably purchase the matching number too. Oh, and the colors are super cute!",5.0

Awesomeness,5.0
Spread everywhere in my house!,5.0
"I bough these when my daughter was 2.  She really liked the beautiful colors and prints on the letters.  I did quite some research to check which product would be safe and without harmful chemicals since toddlers tend to put everything in their mouth.  Saw a lot of cheaper products with unsafe printing materials and dyes and therefore chose to spend a little extra on something that my daughter would be touching often.  I am happy with my purchase.  These are not only beautiful to look at, they are a good size and are built well.  its been many months since I bought them and they haven't worn out.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to buy safe products for their kids.",5.0

"My two year old loves these.  Great pattern and quality, she plays with these all the time!! Fast shipping.  Great Christmas gift!!",5.0
I was looking for letters to accompany my daughter's wooden easel. I am not a fan of plastic toys and wanted to find magnetic letters that were more attractive than the cheap plastic ones I've seen everywhere. These were perfect. I ended up getting a set of uppercase and a set of lowercase. We've had them for over a year and they've stood up fine to my toddler's use.,5.0
These are great quality and super cute! They are a little smaller than I expected but perfect for the 16 month old  purchased them for.,5.0
My little girl loves these! They are super cute and also stick well to the refrigerator since they entire back of each letter is a magnet rather than just one small magnet.,5.0

"perfect tool for learning how to tell time one on one with your child. straight forward, wipes easy, love that dry erase marker is included.",5.0
This is what i was looking for. Bought this to help my grand child learn to tell time. Small enough to keep at home and to travel with.,5.0
Love this. I am able to work one on one with a child that is struggling with mastering how to tell time.,5.0
"It's small enough to fit in my three year old's purse so she can take anywhere. Great product. She did leave the marker open and it dried out, but she had other markers that size so no biggie. We've had this product for over four months and it's held up very very well. It's difficult to bend, won't tear unless you use mega-force. A wipe will clean off the dry erase perfectly.",5.0
Has really helped with learning to tell time,5.0
Great product! I can't believe that I'm just writing this review of this Judy Clock! It was very useful in teaching my grandchildren to tell the time. I highly recommend it to other parents!,5.0

"My niece really enjoyed this. We played for long periods, and it really helped her understand minutes versus hours. She caught on very quickly and I can happily say she tells time very well now!",5.0
"The other reviews are correct, there are other versions of this great game that will hold up better and are better looking. However, I would want to make sure that anyone who doesn't already own this great game is aware that the game itself is a lot of fun and there are many variations/rules variants that can also keep it fresh for long time players. If you haven't tried partnership Acquire, give it a try, it's a whole different game.

For those not familiar with the game, there are tiles that are placed on the game board. When two or more are joined, they form a hotel chain. Only 6 hotel chains can exist on the board at a time, so certain tiles can become unplayable for a period of time. When a tile is played that connects two hotels, they are merged with the longer chain taking over the smaller. If they are the same size, the person playing the merging tile determines which chain takes over.

The subtleties of the game make it one of the true gems of boardgames. Sid Sackson developed the original version about 50 years ago and hundreds, if not thousands, of games have been developed since that in same ways have employed some of the mechanics and strategic elements of this game. Each player has unique information about the future growth of the hotels and the upcoming mergers. They can each take advantage of this but of course, other players can observe what they do and infer what information they have...

If you haven't played this game, you should definitely try it out. You may later find yourself searching on ebay for one of the earlier versions, but this will certainly be a great addition to your games closet if you don't already have it!",5.0

great!!,5.0
I bought this for my son.  He loves this game.,5.0
"Love this board game!  I'm an avid board gamer and I regularly play Agricola, Puerto Rico, Dominion, and others.  The level of difficulty for this board game is pretty low - learning the gameplay is much closer to Dominion or Ticket to Ride vs. Agricola or Puerto Rico.  It's a great game everyone in the family can get into.  We also play it to take a break in between Agricola games :)

We've played it a few dozen times and it has great replay value.  It's a more entertaining version of Monopoly.  It's a turn based game, where each player places a tile on their turn that triggers a certain action in the game - adding to an existing empire, merging two companies together, or reinforcing a company's position.  Lots of fun - highly recommended if you're looking for another game!",5.0
A fun strategic game,5.0
great game,5.0
great game,5.0
"The classic Acquire doesn't get old, and it packs quite a punch for its price tag. It's a shame that Monopoly and Life have become synonymous with mainstream boardgames when this title was still around.

The newest version isn't the most preferred since some older prints had a different set of components that could lock in place, but ultimately it's the same game.",5.0
Well thought up game.  Challenging and satisfying.,5.0
"It's actually a really fun game. The game play is long and moves are based on strategy. You want to have the most amount of stock as well as the most amount of money by the end of the game. There are a lot of rules, so keep the Rule Book near by. I played it once with a couple of friends and now it's the only board game they want to play.",5.0

My favorite game!,5.0
"One of my favorite board games.  It's different every time and luck has very little to do with the outcome.

In this game, you're buying and selling hotel chains.  It's played on a board with tiles.  Each player puts down the tiles to make the hotels grow and can buy stock in the different chains.  The larger the hotel grows, the more it's worth.  When two hotels merge, those with the most stock get paid.  Players must try to remember which players have bought which stock in order to try to have the most stock in a particular chain.

Overall it's a great game.  It doesn't take long to learn and is a lot of fun every time.",5.0
Great strategy game that simulates the real world of buying and selling shares in a company!,5.0

i love this game one of my favorite by fare,5.0
"I don't know if Ive ever taken more delight realizing how the tiles available to me assured my victory.  I couldn't contain my maniacal laughter.  You see, I was the majority shareholder of the corporation that was poised to gobble up all the little people- all the corporations that the other players had invested their hopes of success and they were about to be heart-broken.  Notice though, the key to victory was that tiles were available to me.  I recently played again against a very capable friend and others- who were probably also capable- but the randomly drawn tiles he needed went to someone else who may have hoarded them in spite (I know I did some of that) and his power plays that would have propelled his ambitions were always pre-empted and spoiled.

While usually opposed to games that involve heavy elements of luck, I am apparently making an exception for this game perhaps for so shallow a reason as Ive been so often on the better side of luck.  That said, this game does involve a lot of card counting and positioning, even baiting other players, so frustration can be keen when your carefully laid plans flop.  It leads to a terribly tense game that will keep you from getting to sleep as your mind keeps spinning around what actions brought fruit and which did not.  This is how it works:

Game Play
Youve got a board with plain-Jane grid of numbers and letters, and a stack of tiles for each square.  You randomly draw tiles and can place one each turn and buy up to 3 shares.  If- when you place a tile- you connect previously unconnected tiles you get to start a new corporation- and you get a share- for free!  You still get to buy three more.  Sometimes when you place a tile, you will connect two separate corporations, this triggers a merger where the smaller of the two- or if its a tie, the person to placed the merging tile gets to choose which corporation is bought out.  Now the person who holds the most shares gets a payout, and the person who holds the second largest gets a smaller payout.  Now you can do one of three things:
  Trade your shares two for one into the new parent corporation
  Sell your shares
  Keep your shares in hopes that the corporation will be resurrected on the board later
Shares get more expensive as corporations get larger and corporations can get large enough that they become safe and cannot be merged.

I hate to tell you what to do but
While you can buy shares from any and all open corporations on the board, you would profit from focusing your effort on only three or four.  Because it is difficult to keep track- at least for me- of how many of each your opponents have purchased.  Its especially relieving when the other players are spending their money on shares of corporations you don't care about.

While some hotel chains are higher-rent than others, don't think that you can put all your eggs in one basket.  Even if you are at one time the majority stock holder in the ritziest corporation, you will quickly be bankrupt and others will be able to outspend and pass you.

Ignore participating in small corporations at your peril.  Players who get payouts get money.  Bankrupt is not a place you want to be in for very long in this game.

Theme
Im especially pleased- as someone who cant afford to become even a minority share holder in a real corporation- to get sucked into the world where individual jobs don't exist to me (they are conveniently outside the scope of this game) when I consider merging companies because I need that gross severance for selling out so that I can uh create more jobs with a new corporation, yeah thats it.  Its not about me getting the most money at the end at all.  This teaches nothing about the harsh realities of capitalism, and gives me no insight whatsoever into the minds of corporate giants.  But I have to admit that I love it all the same.

Balance
There are no catch up mechanisms in place in this game, so someone can run away with it, but its a game where you can always claw for second place.  That is, you're personal economy will never be destroyed beyond repair leaving you sitting watching everyone else at the table rejoice in spoils.  I find a lot of satisfaction being able to claw for second place myself.  This is because I, like you have the ability to synthesis happiness.

Interaction
Interaction is high in this game.  Nothing inspires audible grumbling like someone overtaking your position as majority share holder.  And the table is abuzz when mergers happen.

Learning Curve
Very low, The manual is very small.  The vast majority of the rules were explained above and they have a handy little lookup sheet which tells the share prices and payouts for each corporation and for what size.

Downtime
While you do have to wait your turn while others take theirs, and you can annoy people by not paying attention to what others do and when its your turn suddenly the board has changed- youll likely lose because you spent too much money buying shares when no one was competing with you and youll have no one to blame but yourself.  This never happened to me mind you, but I have a friend that  Any downtime you take during this game will be at your expense.

Whats not to Like?
The new edition that I bought is made a little cheaply.  The trays that hold the drawn tiles are cardboard that you put together- well I put mine together, not you.  Its not beautiful to look at, but whats gorgeous about corporate greed?  Dare I say the plainness is part of the theme?  That said, the share cards are easy on the eyes.

Collateral Endorsements
It gets requested by my gaming groups and my wife, who hates Monopoly, loves the game.  I can get my 5 year old to play with me with some simplified rules- we don't deal with money.  Just grow and gobble corporations.",5.0
"Hall of Fame board game. The game is easy to learn and fantastic for 3, 4 or 5 players. Games go very quickly.

This edition is a little cheap, but then that is the case for all games. If you like board games like Cataan, Axis and Allies, Risk, Monopoly or Scrabble, you'll probably really like this.",5.0
It's a fun game. A lot of strategy and every game is different so it has great replay value. It's a classic.,5.0
"Not quite as fun as playing with the original, but a close second.  My kids got a kick out of playing a game from Mom's childhood.  My son even wanted to get an additional set for his college dorm.",5.0
Great game. It is lots of fun to play. If you like to play games that require strategy and money it does both quite well. Also it is quite easy to learn and teach to other people.,5.0
Game of knowing what to buy and sell.  It involves more thinking than some.  Seems to be liked by our game-playing friends:),5.0
"Played this as a kid - still as fun as I remembered.  Great game, balances strategy and luck.  Overall fun to play!",5.0
"This is one of our favorite games, we had played the vintage one at a friends and was looking everywhere for this.  The board is not as good as the original (used to have raised slots so the pieces don't move), but everything is of thick coated cardboard that should last a while.  We only wish the box was designed a bit better to hold all the components in a more organized way.

The game itself is great though, good for strategy players.",5.0
"An Open Letter to GaleForce9*:

Your unpainted miniatures are very not bad. Your spell cards are great. Your board games are ""meh"". Your DM screens, however, are freaking terrible. I'm still waiting for a single screen that isn't polluted with pointless artwork where useful, reference-able tables should be. Once again, you've created a single use screen that is only useful when running the ""Storm King's Thunder"" adventure. Even despite the fact that it's geared to that adventure path, it's usefulness negligible, at best. I massive swath of the inner panel is wasted on artwork and a bloated overland map, which could have been easily reduced to a single panel in size. And the few table you have are nigh-useless themselves.

In short, stop making crap DM screens.",1.0

"I don't know how well they work, if they're a miracle, they're too expensive for the quantity.  When I opened it, I thought they'd forgotten to send the tatoos.
10 for 3.50 makes this the ultimate ""skimpy product"".",1.0
"These are cute tatoos for those who love pirates, however, the retail price is $1.50 and Amazon's price is MORE THAN DOUBLE.  I have never paid OVER the retail price for an item at Amazon.  I was shocked.  There are only a handful of tatoos, and for 1.50 I wouldn't mind, but to charge 3.50 for an item that sells anywhere else for 1.50 is criminal.  Find it at a local drugstore and save your $.",1.0
"total waste of money. the stickers do not stick down even once
it is just a tiny amount of stickers which do not work, and that is basically it. I thought the backgrounds would make this special but it just is tiny and does not work.
much better to simply buy packs of stickers and use paper
the activity books in this series are better",1.0
"My grandson loved this book, he is all about robots and how they work, fun ideas for him to share with a friend.",1.0
Contains enough stickers to create a tiny robot. Not really worth buying.,1.0
"This is advertised as stickers to build your own robot, what I received was the cover of the book with one sheet of stickers folded inside (not even stapled just stuck inside) and they were not even robots, they were firetrucks.",1.0
"Sticker Activity Book my arse. This ""book"" is 2 pages of stickers, folded in half and stapled inside a cover jacket. It's not a book, and there are no activities to speak of, except for peeling off the stickers (robot parts) and affixing them to the back page.

Oh, and did I mention this is TINY?  The whole book is about the size of a passport (but with less pages) and there is about 4 robots total on the little pages (parts are parts, but I counted 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 feet, and a body on each of the 4 pages).

So that works out to $1.00 per assembled robot - total ripoff.",1.0
This is a poorly put together piece of junk. We try to purchase toys that are simple and built with materials that will last. We loved this toy as kids.

"Book is nice but Pom poms never come out right. Either book gives wrong measurements of string length or the Pom Pom make it come with doesn't do proper job.

"I am completely shocked by all of the positive reviews. This kit is truly ridiculous. I recently purchased the 4M Fairyland Dollies kit which was awesome and the fairies came out adorable. I thought this would be similar but it was a joke. I had no problem making the pom-poms but once you get into having to cut the pom-poms to shape them into dogs it becomes pretty much impossible and the mess is out of control. If you can get anywhere close to having your pom-poms look like dogs you then have to glue all of the features on with the tiny little glue tube they give you and it just a useless sticky mess. To make matters worse the little accessories are made out of thin cheap paper - how this could be marketed as something a child could either make or play with is beyond me. So, to make a long story short, if you love getting pissed off, making a mess and having your kid cry, order this kit!",1.0
This was a huge disappointment! There was only enough material to make 4 dogs. The Pom Pom maker was a joke. We loved the Pom Pom critters kit way better and that one supplied you with a lot of accessories.,1.0
Only buy this for an adult who is super patient and likes to be covered in fuzz.  It was a frustrating project to do with an 8 year old. There will be crying when the glue doesn't hold and the puppies head falls off.  It makes a terrible mess and there is not even that much yarn included.  I would never be able to make the puppies look anywhere close to the ones in the book.  Ours turned out crazy looking.  Book went straight to Goodwill.,1.0
This is horrible! The directions are very hard for a child to read and comprehend themselves. The yarn made a mess. My daughter was so excited to get this and cried when she couldn't understand how to make them. I would not recommend this to anyone!,1.0
This game is extremely boring and takes far too long.,1.0
It's too small and too pricey!,1.0
If I could give this egg zero stars I would. It is poorly made and rudiculously hard to open. What should be a tender moment spent with your children is a huge headache. I had to use a knife to open it and the knife literally broke off. That is how difficult it is. Horrible product. Dont buy.,1.0

"This is not an actual Judy clock, which should have ""visible functioning gears maintain correct hour-hand and minute-hand relationships.""

"When I heard that Acquire was coming back I was over-joyed.  My buddy has a copy of the 1999 version and it is one of the funnest games I have ever played.  I have even been watching ebay for quite some time to find a 1999 version but if you can find one it will frequently go for over $100 it is that good.

However, this new version is total crap.  They changed the look and feel of the game.  I guess Avalon Hill doesn't listen to their customers or understand the value of the game they once produced.",1.0
CHEAP GAME. Flimsy. Get an old version and spend more money.,1.0
"Do not waste your money on this. There are no plastic parts whatsoever. Its all cardboard and paper. the tiles slide around because they don't lock into place like the ""real"" versions of this game. If it wasn't a gift I would return it immediately.",1.0
"This is a horrible edition of an awesome game.  You will have more fun buying one of the original bookshelf versions, as the design of this game is an injustice to it's storied history.  Why Hasbro doesn't actually produce a quality version with a separated game board, I will never understand.  The original, and the 1999 versions are extremely durable and playable.  The only redeeming quality of this version is the stock certificates, which are finally made of durable laminated paper.  Hasbro could easily sell a quality version for a premium price.  If you cannot find another version - this is still one of the best board games ever.  But spend your money on an original - readily available on auction sites.

P.S. I have almost every version available - including 2 German versions.  Great game - horrible waste of cardboard.",1.0
"A crappy cardboard ghost of the original.  Hard to believe they did this, but they did.  Shame on Hasbro.  Disgusting.",1.0
"I guess I did not look closely to the information on this game. I had the impression that it was similar to the Acquire that I used to play in the 80's.
The quality in this one is not at all what it use to be. Now it looks cheap. I would have paid more to get a better quality.",1.0
"We have this same game but it was made in 1967, we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better!! This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard!! We just gave this game a way and kept our old one!!",1.0
"Hated this product.

Predictable.  Not fun.  It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.  Often times I thought ""this seems like d&d battle....  Just kidding"".  We never played it again after one play through.

Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.

"I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.

Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.

The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.

I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.",1.0
"The product description specifies that this product ""contains 50 miniatures"" BUT THIS IS FALSE.--The package actually only contains FIVE miniatures. VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially considering a COMPLETE STARTER GAME SET-UP costs less than $25 including postage on Amazon (and this 5-piece booster cost me $13 including postage).",1.0
"There are way too many similar looking tiles!  It is difficult for ME to be able to match the pairs, as so many of them look the same.  For example, the front shovel and track loader look so similar.  Both have blue backgrounds, and if you're like me (a woman who doesn't know the technical name for each piece of big diggers,) it is impossible to get these to match up!  My son who's almost 5 and is very advance has no interest in this game either.  The cards are too similar and ""boring"" to look at.  Everything is orange, yellow, and black, and a few have blue backgrounds, but there is nothing visually stimulating about this game.  Spend your money on something else!",1.0
This says it is 5 SHEETS when in fact it is 5 strips of paper.  Definately NOT worth the money.  The stickers were hard for the child to remove from the backing as the backing came off of the sheet with the sticker.,1.0

"Reading all the positive reviews, I'm wondering if we all played the same game.  In a nutshell, this game is far too easy, far too short, and not very interesting.  The winner is more determined by who goes first than anything else, and frankly, the letter distribution is such that it is near impossible not to make a word immediately.  My wife and I played this game two or three times before we were utterly bored.  This is contrast to ""Word Thief"", also a Scrabble like word card game.  That game, however, is far more challenging, much more involved, and will last more than 5 minutes, and can be played with as little as two players. Buy ""Word Thief"", and forget ""Quiddler"".",1.0

"What a great aid to a fun game!  Our family has played Quiddler for many years.  The discovery of this dictionary was accidental, but I decided to order it as I thought  it would save time looking up words on the iPad.  The only problem was that after using the dictionary for a couple of months my husband discovered that our copy was missing pages 281 to 296!!!  I e-mailed the company to no avail & then decided to telephone Arizona & speak directly to a real person.  She was very surprised & extremely apologetic for the problem.  She assured me that a new, complete copy would be sent to my home.  As that conversation only took place less than 72 hours ago, I have not yet received the dictionary, but I have every confidence that is will be sent as promised.  So beware! check your copy carefully when it arrives.  I am sure that my faulty copy is not the only one out there.  The dictionary itself, by the way, is excellent.  There are lots of words which were unknown to me - an English major in university!  The entries are divided alphabetically, of course, but also by word length - from 1 to 5 letters.  In all a great concept.",1.0

"This game is simply not fun as it promotes too much solitary thought and not a lot of interaction.
We played two rounds, one with 4 people and one with 2 people and never did we draw more than twice per round.
Here's how our 2 player rounds went:
3 card - lay down (i.e. called ""out"" on the initial deal with no need to draw or discard (although I drew and discarded a card to keep up with the rules).
4 card round - lay down
5 card round - lay down
6 card round - 1 draw
7 card round - 1 draw
8 card round - lay down
9 card round - lay down
10 card round - lay down

Here's how our 4 player round went:
3 card - lay down
4 card - lay down
5 card - lay down
6 card - 1 draw
7 card - lay down
8 card - 1 draw
9 card - lay down
10 card - lay down
Now, this is simply not fun.

Without the interaction and excitement of drawing/discarding and building your hand, plus the excitement that one of your opponents may call out before you, this came is no better than giving players random letters and telling them to make words.  Seriously, deal out a bunch of scrabble tiles and you have the same thing.

A typical round is shuffle, deal, first player stares at his/her cards for 10 minutes, making words and usually makes an instant lay down.  Player 2 draws a card, makes words, and lays hand down.  Shuffle and repeat.  The lack of interaction in this game is what gives it 1 star (would give it 0 if I could and would return it, except its already open).

I don't think this is a fun game and I don't see how it can have so many 5 star reviews.  This game just isn't that fun.  It's more fun to play rumy or hearts or spades or Euchre, or a number of other games that are essentially free and don't involve, long, boring, non-interactive turns.",1.0

"I decided to play for a bit thinking I can still have some fun but A.D. I'm playing I realized there is no blue yellow or white cards not only am I missing that but there is no black pieces so I can't have 5 players and the game isn't so fun without the special missions especially since were all fighting to build over the Orange, green, pink, and red since there is no other colors!!!!!",1.0
"Don't waste you money.  Buy Ticket to Ride Europe instead. I wish I had. Many of locations on the route cards are incorrect. They list two locations on a card and then show dots on the map on that card that are incorrect.  Very confusing when you are playing. It is surprising to see this poor quality from this game maker.  They did not include the listed number of trains in two of the bags.  Luckily,  they include a bag of extras.  The cards in the Europe version are a perfect size where the USA version they are tiny and much harder to read.",1.0

The Amazon shopping box was untouched and included a book I also purchased and it was fine, so I am assuming Ticket to Ride was stored inproperly and packaged damaged. I've attached pictures!",1.0

I am giving this a 1 star for poor company decision making.... it's like going to your favorite restaurant and they've removed your favorite dish.",1.0
This game is awful. These reviews have to be fake. I bought the game to play on a family summer vacation and nobody in the large group enjoyed it. In fact they all joked the following year about how terrible the game was.

"I seriously hate this game. Everyone in my group hates it. It's the most overrated game in the history of all games. If you are an avid board gamer, the most you will get out of this is using it to convince someone who hates board games to play with you. Why you would want to convince someone who hates board games to play with you is beyond me, but whatever. That's why it's a ""gateway game"" that is ""fun for all ages""--there are barely rules, so lazy folks can get in on the non-existent action.

Cons:
You get to do one thing a turn.
It's pretty much entirely luck based.
People act like it's a big deal when you block them off from completing their routes, but it's almost always just the only thing you can do because this game is boring and its objectives are boring and only getting to do one thing a turn means you don't have time to sit around and troll people.
The map is ugly and boring, the train pieces are generic pieces of plastic like Fisher Price toys out of the 90s.
Zzzzzzzzzz.

Pros:
I guess you can get people who hate games to play with you.

If you're still convinced that this is the ultimate game for you, at least don't buy it new.",1.0
"It needs changes in four of its rules, and reminds me of Risk, where I could potentially lose friends.  The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!",1.0

"I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's the same exact thing (just clarifying why I'm not a ""Verified Purchase"" reviewer for this specific product).

In terms of quality, I have no issues. It's well made, the quality of the book is really good. The illustrations seem like they could use a little more color and a little more skill, but they're fine overall. This book and the box it comes in along with the Elf are made to last few years.

With all that being said, I have a really big concern about the whole idea behind this ""tradition."" We did it at our house last year, and unfortunately, we're doing it again this year, although I'm trying to figure out now how to get out of it without crashing my daughter's feelings and destroying the trust that she currently has in us.

So you might want to know what my issue with this Elf is.... Well, I have a regular kid at home (to me, she is perfect, but to the outside world she is most likely just a regular kid). She misbehaves sometimes, she doesn't always follow my directions or requests (don't we all hate asking our little people in the house to brush their teeth multiple times just to discover that it was never done?!). She sometimes throws tamper tantrums, but overall, I love her just the way she is. Which is why I keep asking myself, why on earth did I ever lie to her about an Elf who tells on her everyday to Santa?! I read somewhere that it's just lazy parenting, and it really is. It feels like it. I don't like threatening my child. I like teaching her about consequences of her behavior, which is absolutely necessary, but threatening her with a toy who creepily comes alive at night and tells Santa that she was ""bad?"" That feels just cruel, and stressful to her, which brings me to my second point.

Even though my kid absolutely adores this Elf (she couldn't wait for her to come!), she is also very stressed out about it. I don't ever even say anything to her about the Elf watching or the Elf reporting bad behavior to Santa. I try to give it as little significance as I can, but she still is stressed (she is 6). Ever since the Elf came, she has trouble sleeping through the night. She tries her best to behave well for most of the day, but it's followed by a temper tantrum in the evening, because it's probably emotionally just too difficult to handle to have to be ""perfect"" all day long. Whether it's because of excitement or stress, or maybe it's just too much stimulation for her imagination (believing that objects come to life at night is a little creepy and unsettling when you think about it). She is not herself, and her sleep (and mine) is interrupted because of that. The home should be a relaxing, safe place; not a place where she is constantly watched and judged by her beloved little Elf.

And then, I already feel bad about lying about Santa. Now I'm lying about the Elf. Will this kid ever trust me when she finds out? Will she think that we lied about other things as well?

For us, adults, the elf is simply a fun toy, but to the kids, he is REAL. And that can be very unsettling for them. Just don't do it to your kid. It's not worth it, it's mean, and as a parent who has done it I can tell you that it doesn't feel good to me to have to lie to my child on daily basis and make her be so excited about something that I know is one big lie.",1.0

Unfortunately, ours had a mishap this year (got too close to a lightbulb), and I needed to quickly replace him. I was impressed with Amazon at the speed with which he arrived. However, the new one looked NOTHING like the old one!! The quality of the painting was sub-par and messy, and the face shape, paint colors, eye shape, and hair were not as colorful or cute as our original one. The felt used for the body and hat on the new one is cheaper and rougher, more of a thick, scratchy felt than the soft one we had. He just seemed so dull and cheap, comparatively. Sadly, it seems they have let the quality go in favor of mass production. Luckily, only the body of ours had been damaged, so I was able to do a full head transplant, and my kids were none the wiser. When my kids noticed these new ones in the stores this year, they actually commented on how different they looked from theirs at home! Additionally, I looked for just the elf without the book, but found that I had to repurchase the entire set, so now I have an extra book and box.

"First, just a niggling semantic note; the ""Elf on the Shelf"" is not a 'tradition' - it is  a marketing campaign for a product and that is all it is.

One fascinating proof of this is the ongoing battle the Elf on the Shelf Wikipedia page. When anyone edits to point out that you can't create a ""tradition"" in four years of TV marketing the proprietors of the toy swoop in and edit it back out. It goes on and on and is amusing if you are interested in Wiki wars. [...]

It is not a coincidence that one of this marketing juggernaut's creators (Christa Pitts) worked at QVC before becoming a full-time Elf-On-the-Shelf entrepreneur.

The product in question  is a cheesy, cheaply made `elf' doll (which is not actually a doll - see below) and a book of instructions (for $30!).

One of the instructions is that your child must never EVER touch this toy.

Do you not as a parent have the slightest pause when you read that?

My own conclusion is that this has more to do with what a cheap piece of junk it is and how it could never withstand rigorous actual `playing' than any manufactured rules of engagement for a spurious fake `tradition'. In fact I am certain that it does not even meet any child saftey manufacture standards, but that's not why I am revolted by it.

My reaction to this particular marketing gambit can be summed up as 'ewww, what a creepy concept'. Kids will be over supervised and monitored adults soon enough without Santa sending 'spies' into their bedrooms in childhood. George Orwell would shudder along with me I am sure.

Now the idea of toys animating themselves is not in and of itself creepy but is actually fun and pretty much an integral part of all children's fantasy life. The `Toy Story"" films obviously mine this theme but there are many other instances; the most `traditional' if you will being the story of Pinocchio.

I adore those charming parents who work deep into the night to stage vignettes with their kids' plastic dinosaurs:[...] and I don't think it would take much effort for an intuitive parent to do something like that with any toy that they chose and hold the spying part of the narrative all together ::sheesh:: Plus there would be absolutely no need to do this during the already overstimulating Christmas season but maybe save it for summer when nights are long and the imaginations might benefit from a creative nudge.

To the `Elf on the Shelf' and his marketing slaves (the parents who do this) I say `Bah, Humbug!""",1.0

If we need manipulative trickery to bend our kids in behaving a certain way, we failed as parents.
Since then my son loves this elf. He is his buddy and we don't have to deal with the freaky spying thing around the house.",1.0

"I don't want to be insulting but this story isum...not smart. Wait, it's actually worse than that. Instead of a sweet Christmas magic kind of vibe (like you get from the book ""Dear Santa""), the elf in this story takes on a nasty, ""I'm going to tell on you"" annoying snitch-like persona. If the child touches him, he takes his ball and goes home? I say good riddance.",1.0

Here's a creepy little elf and a book.  If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity. Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00. This is awful quality too.  I would not recommend thistle anyone.  Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar!,1.0
"My mother in law gave us this god-forsaken thing. Unfortunately we opened it in front of the kids, so we were stuck.
Gimmicky, and just another thing for mommy/daddy to have to remember every freaking night after kids finally in bed, dishes washed and you have a few minutes to yourself before passing out. ""Did you hide the elf?"" ""No, oh god, I can't even get up, can you do it?"" , back and forth etc... Or more often as we get up in the morning ""S***! Honey did you hide the stupid elf?"", cuz we usually forget.
 Isn't the advent calendar enough for counting down to Christmas? I HATE this little annoying skinny red guy. I love when we hide him really well and my kids can't find it for a few days to give me a break. My husband and I go all out for Christmas, decorating, taking kids to special shows, ice skating, donating to charities, participating in Christmas church events... this is just cheesy and over the top and too much work. We plan to have him ""disappear"" between the packing up of Christmas decs this year and next holiday season.",1.0

The elf is made of cardboard and covered with cheap red felt. No skirt is included for the girl, so she might as well be a boy. Also, the book is very thin and the authors make it sound like they came up with this Elf on a Shelf thing all on their own.

Very disappointed. Shouldn't cost more than $10 for this cheap piece of crap.",1.0

"My mom bought this for the ""magic"" that it brings around Christmastime for my two younger siblings. I was sitting on the couch, thoroughly enjoying Archer via Netflix, and she comes in excitedly, and beckons my little brother and sister in the room. I'm not thrilled, because I have to pause the funniest show on television, but my mom does pay for Netflix, even though I still live here, so I sigh heavily and open another cylinder of Pringles.

They're a lot younger than I am; Kevin is six, and Kayla is nine, so I can see why they would be excited about an elf figurine. I believed in Santa once too, right before my parents shattered my dreams and aspirations of one day being a sleigh mechanic for Santa by telling me of his nonexistence. This is always a bitter and magic-less time of year for me, and I haven't really had a good Christmas since my 28th. I love my mom, she seems really excited about this Elf toy, but the back story she gives about ""Hubert"" explaining his existence as a pawn and rat to the big man up North is total BS. She's got this massive Cheshire cat grin on her face as she tells them how this smug little Brownie relays every action in the house to Saint Nick as 'good' or 'bad.' He can't talk, but you can talk to him. Reminds me of Uncle Owen right before they took him off life support. Kevin and Kayla are awestruck, these massive Rockwellian smiles pasted where their mouths should be, fully believing that every good thing they do will result in more Christmas loot...

 I'm a little ticked. My mom comes in, interrupts Archer, and is now lying her face off to these innocent little children, who fully believe the fabricated story she has just pitched to them. She reminds me so much of a used car salesman right now that I start having flashbacks. So she places this Product of China on the mantlepiece, sitting right above my stocking. I would move it, but I'm already halfway through this can of chips, and I don't want to wash my hands until after I've finished them.

He's been sitting there for ffifteen minutes, and I'm already sick of him. What a little snitch, tattling to Santa whether they've been good or bad. I don't know who invented this little trinket, but their interpretation of Christmas Cheer is obviously warped, rendering the morning of the 25th completely dependent on behavioral absolutes. What a tool. The two K's have gone to play Wii or something, but promised my mother they'd come back and tell 'Hubert' goodnight. She's in the back room, reading Fifty Shades of Grey for the 4th time.

So I get a bright idea to cure Hubert of his cheery smile. I don't like it, it's way too big for his face, and extremely unnatural. Really, who has cheek muscles that big? Maybe Schwarzenegger, in the middle of that phase where he would chew Double Bubble and shoot up simultaneously. So I go the the kitchen drawer, open it up, and behold, a Super Sharpie in plain sight. Popping the lid off, I make a beeline straight for Hubert and that stupid little face of his, and I draw a Stalin 'stache and some excessively sharp teeth. I'm cracking myself up as I transform this cheery little face into a bad trip of a Toy Story character. Finishing, I return the marker and go play WOW in my room.

About half an hour later and I hear my name screeched through the hallway two octaves higher than notes should go, and I sheepishly trudge into the living room. My mother is standing there, hands on hips, actual tears on her face, completely overreacting and exaggerating how I've ruined Christmas for the kids, and that she would have expected that sort of behavior out of me in my mid 20's. I sigh as I walk to the kitchen, retrieve a magic eraser, and annoyingly direct myself to the mantle, where the nightmare face of Hubert glares at me.

 I hold him in one hand, the other furiously scrubbing to remove the blatant Communism above his lip. I pause for a moment to check my progress, and his face is gone. Just gone. No smug little grin, no caricatural eyelashes, nothing. Nothing there but flesh colored plastic. Apparently these magic erasers are a little more potent than I expected. Mom's really lost it now. I get lectured, grounded, and sent to my room, where I am currently writing this review. Oh, and my mom says I have to buy a new one.",1.0
"This was really a Pinterest impulse buy... Looking at all the funny pictures of the elf on the shelf doll on Pinterest was what made purchase it. (some of them are hilarious.

A complete waste waste of good  $30. After reading the book that it comes with, I was extremely disappointed. I'm not only getting rid of it but I will not pass this on the anyone.

"I have no problem with creating a little ""Christmas Magic"" for children. However, this is a far-cry from anything magical; potentially causing more ""harm"" than good. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas for all the right reasons, but this is simply not one of them.

To some, ""Elf on the Shelf"" may appear to be a harmless, charming, and ""all-watching"" doll for the fantasy and adoration of children. Remove the ""fantasy and charm"" from the equation, and you've got nothing short of a creepy ""spy"" of sorts. For me, and many others, it is an intimidating symbol for the behavior modification of children; an unwritten ""threat,"" if you will.

I must fully concede that in my childhood, I was scared of anything that I believed was ""watching me."" Having read books where animals ""come to life"" is not always a positive one. Sometimes the intent (construed by the child) may be to ""cause harm."" I know that I am not alone in this suggestion, as I've seen similar posts from others. The suggestion to move this figure around the home (or wherever) so that it can ""watch"" the children may be a very scary proposal, and one you might want to discuss before buying.  If my parents had had one of these things when I was in my childhood...I would have absolutely freaked out! No, not in a good way either.

From the vast numbers of comments (good and bad) that I've read, it appears that so many proponents of this overly commercialized franchise are using it as a psychological ""tool"" of sorts. Hey, nothing like having a ""spy-cam"" converted into an Elf, right? Whether or not you agree, that is essentially what this thing is doing. And yes, for those of you who wonder if I've even ""read the book?"" I have; cute book -- scary doll.

My suggestion to parents boils down to this - talk to your children FIRST! Don't think that this is guaranteed to be received as a ""good surprise"" for the Holiday Season. Some will, and definitely, some won't. The suggestion that this ""Elf"" will make your children ""behave well,"" is just about as misguided as the parents who buy Baby Einstein videos/books; believing their child will be the next child prodigy or Nobel Prize winner - despite the fact there's simply no evidence that they work, much less, ever been tested (which they haven't).

If you're that worried about the behavior of your children and what they're up to, invest in a wireless security camera(s). There are also ""Nanny"" programs for the computer, and the list goes on, ad infinitum.

As for me, this thing simply puts the ""Creepy"" in ""Christmas.""",1.0
"Great idea. Put a narc on the mantle and tell your kids they are under surveillance. Our elf started out following the rules, but by week 2 he was visiting my children in their dreams and asking for protection money in exchange for good reports. We didn't catch on until Santa contacted us directly and said that despite the kids amazing behavior he was going to have trouble fitting that pony into the sleigh.

When confronted, Elfish wouldn't cop to the crime, but instead offered the same deal to me. I DO want a new motorcycle, but don't want to set a bad example for the kids. Upon further consideration, we decided to take the elf out to the pine barrens and leave him there. Here's hoping he's not like Chuckie and doesn't come back to haunt us.",1.0
"The whole concept is so creepy and negative. What a great way to turn something beautiful like Christmas into something ugly and frightening. Yuck! If your parenting stinks so bad that you need this elf, may I suggest some parenting classes instead? If you have truly taught your children values and how to be a good human being, they will carry over into the times when nobody is watching. I can't believe how many good reviews this creepy, manipulative, control freak device is getting. Sad commentary on society.",1.0

"I guess I'm in the minority who thinks this ""toy"" is downright creepy.  A creepy little spy to report what you do in the privacy of your own home?  A way for parents to enforce good behavior while they themselves lie to their children?  Horrible.

"With Christmas closely approaching I found myself seeking out any and all classic holiday traditions to introduce to my three-year-old son. For years I have heard the miracle stories about the Elf on the Shelf saving Christmas by turning the most ill-behaved child into an angel, halo and all. I excitedly spent $30 on the set thrilled to read this Christmas story Thanksgiving night before bed and begin a tradition I was sure we would carry on for years- and then I read the book... I was disinterested immediately but hoped it would get better. My son was not buying into this ""story"" either. Truth is, the book is not a story and they should not call it a story book. It is merely a slightly enhanced instruction manual with some narrative. My son is very into the magic of Christmas and frequently declares that he loves Santa and wants to visit the North Pole. This story however fails to bring the Elf to life even with the ""magic"" he claims to have. I decided to put the Elf perched on a plant for my son to find the next day in hopes he might get excited upon seeing him- epic fail. He did not notice him but managed to notice a picture frame out of place. Final verdict: the Elf on Shelf really is just a lifeless stuffed toy void of any magical super powers. Pretty sure this only works on children easily manipulated and extremely gullible. Save your $30 on real Christmas books that will truly bring the spirit and magic of Christmas alive by delivering something children can think about and discuss with you.",1.0
"Here's a test of how empty and meaningless your life really is.

You can either lead a productive life during the holidays, wrapping up things at work, helping the poor, and a host of other things that actually are in the spirit of the season.

Or you can buy an elf and, while the kids are sleeping, have it make messes around the house. Messes that you will have to clean up.

Seriously? Who dreams up this nonsense? More importantly, what idiot would actually look at this on Amazon or the toy store and say, ""Oh, this sounds like a good idea because I don't have enough to do as it is!""

I mean, isn't the glittering mound of presents beneath the tree enough? I mean if you really want to build anticipation for Christmas morning, why not buy a freaking Advent calendar instead?

So if you are having a hard time filling up your day as it is with manicures, tennis lessons, and your book club's in-depth discussions of Fifty Shades Of Gray, then knock yourself out. But rather than this incredible make-work book, why not use your bottomless reserves of energy to hie thyself down to a soup kitchen or start a toy drive for underprivileged children? I think that would be a far better use of your time than this ridiculous thing.",1.0

I have no problem telling my kids that St. Nick visits every kid's house in just one night using slower-than-light even-toed ungulate technology, but the idea of Claus Inc. outsourcing the Naughty or Nice list to some magic elf outfit is just wrong. Not only that, but parents are forced to become part of the child monitoring labor force because the onshore elves are lazy oafs who'll just sit in one spot without our intervention. Santa - please!

"I had purchased this little toy after a friend at work had recommended it to me. It sounded like a cute little game that would build up the kitty's anticipation for Christmas. A simple game where the parent hides the elf around the house and the kid looks for it in the morning. The legend is that the elf spies on the kid, and then reports back to Santa every night. Not only did it sound fun, but it was one more way to black mail the little turds into being good around the holidays. Well worth the price of 24 bucks...or so I thought.

Well, things started out as you could expect. I would come home in the evening and tell the kids to grab me a beer while I would sit down to watch TV. They would ignore me, an act that usually resulted with me yelling, and throwing my shoes at them, but with the magic of Christmas in the air, and Pedro on the shelf (the name given to our elf by the kids) my frosty malted beverage would find its way to my hand within a minute. Just when I was really starting to like the novelty (although I was still a little piffed as to why our version turned out to be a Puerto Rican elf), things took a turn for the worse.

It started when my daughter asked me one night why the elf liked to spy on her. I told her that it was because he would let Santa know whenever she was naughty. She asked what that meant, and I proceeded to explain to her that it meant that he would basically rat her out whenever she did something bad, like wet the bed. Well as luck would have it, that very night she had a little ""accident"", and because she was afraid that the elf would tell on her, she decided to hide the soiled sheet under her bed. Well about a week later the whole room wreaked of urine and tears. That was strike one for the elf.

The second strike came one morning when the kiddos were looking for the sneaky little guy. I had hid it
The night before, but by this time I had a little game of my own going on. See, I would get all crazy on wine and pain killers whenever I would hide it, that way it was a game for me to find it in the morning myself! A little way to bring some holiday magic for myself as well. Anyway, after about an hour and a half the elf was still MIA, and I had lost interest in ever finding the little SOB again. As many will agree, children are much more persistent than adults when it comes to these things, so they were still going strong trying to find the little man. It finally got to the point where I couldn't take it any longer and I howled out that Christmas was make believe, Santa was fake, the elf was a hoax, and there was no Jesus. Well they all start crying, and only stopped when they found the elf five minutes later. I had placed it in a provocative position with one of the dogs squeaky toys. I had to answer a lot of questions about the birds and the bees for the next several hours. About the least desirable thing to do when your nursing one heck of a hangover, I'll tell you that much. They were finally satisfied that old Pedro probably had a little too much tequila the night before, and had decided to find himself an unclean lady of the night. Strike two.

The third and final strike occurred when they decided to play elf on the shelf one day after school. My eldest was going to play the part of the elf, while the youngest of my brood was going to play herself (not creative in the least but what do you expect from a kid that hides her urine soaked sheets under the bed). Well, while the old one was looking for a good hiding spot, he ended up coming across my stash of Asian fetish porn. Apparently he found something he liked because I find him in the closet all the time looking at the magazines. Sick little pervert. Needless to say that we won't be carrying on this tradition because letting this elf into our home has done nothing but corrupt and taint my kids. Unless you want to ruin Christmas for the foreseeable future, stay away from this one.",1.0
"OK, I think kids have enough pressure from the world without having a fake elf sitting around watching them. I totally disagree with this concept. If you want children to enjoy life, stop with the judging threats and just teach them to be happy and to expect to make mistakes from time to time.

"The worst thing, as the buyer, of this product is how ridiculously cheap this product is made.
For the price ($30-$40), this has one of the poorest made stuffed animals I have ever seen.  I expect more from a McDonalds happy meal.

The kids like the story, I get sick of moving it every night (or forgetting to move it each night), but bottom line, they are taking advantage of consumers with a hugely overpriced piece of china junk.

Don't waste your time and money.",1.0
"My wife had me running around looking for one of these after getting a rave review from a friend of hers.  I was sorely disappointed.  The premise is kind of cute, but the story is fairly mediocre, the elf looks cheesy and doesn't sit up by itself (my wife always has to lean it on something). If it had cost $10 I might not feel so ripped off, but unfortunately I bought it for the ridiculous price of $30.

But I think I'm most uncomfortable about the premise of lying to my child.  It's not that I expect it will cause any trauma or anything, I'd just prefer not to do it.  If this is not an issue for you, I'd recommend buying a much cooler/sweeter/prettier Christmas-themed character or stuffed animal for $5 somewhere, and spinning your own (probably better) story.  The storybook is completely unnecessary and just lays out the premise without providing much in the way of reading entertainment.",1.0
"I was unsure of this concept from the get-go and didn't think much of the looks of the actual elf but, because it appears to be so popular, I thought perhaps my misgivings were generational.  However, when I presented it to the party for whom it was a gift, they found the ""elf"" tself to be rather freakish, the book to be thoroughly boring, its graphics unappealing and the whole concept not something they wanted to introduce into their positive family dynamic.  We actually decided we could come up with a far better concept on our own but do not like the idea of a ""spy"" nor of affirming the necessity of a ruse in order to have your children behave.  All in all, we got a good laugh at the expense of this goofy-looking elf but found the whole premise not to our liking.  Ebay has a new item up for sale!",1.0
"This book is the creepiest thing I have ever seen, oh and the elf is super creepy as well!  I can't believe kids run around at christmas time thinking that this elf is going to head back to the north pole and tell santa if they are naughty or nice.  Given the political climate about wiretaps, TSA, big brother it may actually be good that kids believe they are spied on day in and day out at christmas.  Instead of a little elf we should all get the adult version-- Dick Cheney as a tiny doll who will report to the government if you have been bad or good.

Or that this family will go to church more so that they will better understand the scriptural account of Santa and elves?  What do children make of all the ""traditions"" that marketing executives have created to enhance the meaning of our holydays?

I read the book with my daughter and find it creepy and very negative. I immediately told her she could hold the elf and he was just fun and we would play hide and seek with him in the mornings.
I don't like the idea of scaring her into behaving because this creepy little elf is going to run off and tell Santa what she did all day. I wish I had read the reviews before opening this or even read the book myself first as I would have put it away immediately. Luckily she is only 2.5 and was too busy playing with the elf to pay close attention when I was reading the book.
I found something called the Magic Elf Shoe on another review and it seems much more positive and fun.

As someone who received this as a gift I would agree to speak with parents first as this is not for everyone.",1.0
"At the recommendation of other parents and the positive reviews on amazon, I bought the Elf on the Shelf box set. I was genuinely excited to play this game with my 4-year-old son, who is totally into the Santa concept this year.

Before showing it to him (thank goodness) I read the book and then promptly returned the box set. Besides the fact that the toy itself was kind of cheap looking, I was deeply troubled by the strong threatening consumerism/materialistic messaging ""be good or you won't get what you want for Christmas"" and that Santa won't come unless you get good reports from the elf, as presented in the book. The messaging is strongly judgmental and focused on good and bad, concepts that are important to discuss, but I don't believe in this hazy context of threats and ultimatums, as the book presents. As one commenter noted, it's creepily Orwellian.

I know there are other ways to discipline and control behavior than to threaten doom and gloom on the most exciting day of the year for many little kids. Why not focus on the positive aspects of Christmas, rather than instilling anxiety? I mean really, if your kid is bad, are you not going to give him/her the present he/she wanted anyway, that you already bought? Just some food for thought.

I realize a lot of people enjoy EOTS; to each his/her own. Like some other reviews here, I recommend asking the parents before giving this as a gift, since it does involve parenting philosophies. There are other options to Elf on the Shelf.

I went to the Hallmark store and was delighted to find Everett the Elf, a much more positive and open ended elf-centric holiday toy/game. This elf lost his shoe while scouting chimney sizes for Santa. In the accompanying story, there is no mention of good or bad behavior. Every day I put a little surprise in the magic shoe for my son. One day it was a couple of magic chocolate coins, the next day, Everett brought news that we were going to the grandparents' house to decorate their Christmas tree. Much more fun for all than repeating the threats of ""the elf is watching and reporting to Santa!""",1.0
"I was very disappointed with this product.  The premise was very cute, however, the story was an issue for me.  I am not a fan of ever telling a child that he or she is bad which this book does.  I teach my children that attitudes, behaviors, words, actions etc can be bad but people are not bad.  I also was not crazy about promoting the commercialism of Christmas which this story does.  Between labeling children as ""good or bad"" and telling children that if they are ""good"" Santa will bring them whatever they want doesn't support my values.  If I had read the story before giving it to my child, I never would have given it to him.  Lucky for me he had zero interest in the story or searching for the elf each morning, so I promptly resold the entire kit.  Perhaps a rewrite of this book to reflect current day values and terminology is in order!  I plan to focus on the true meaning of Christmas.",1.0
"I have updated my review to perhaps provide information to those of you who may be on the fence.

My five year old daughter received this as a gift.  When she first heard the story she asked questions such as ""Does the elf have batteries?"" and ""It's not real, is it?"" and commented that it doesn't look friendly.  We visited the website and she liked the animation; we had fun playing a few of the games together.  Ultimately, though, she was not interested in participating in the tradition, and after learning about it myself I am glad she didn't find it appealing.

I have seen posts where some people purchase the elf but decide not to use the elf to report to Santa every day, but rather to simply be a reminder to make good choices. For those of you that this idea appeals to, I was reading about another product, Elf Magic...you might check into that...people say it looks friendlier.

There are many blogs and reviews out there...many more that are positive than negative. Many folks say that the elf works to help improve your child's behavior during this month, that as parents we need all the help we can get, and/or that kids enjoy looking for the elf each morning. I have also read many reviews where childrens' first instinct is to be scared and afraid of the elf, and that if you are providing good direction as parents, the elf is not needed and many other Christmas traditions are preferred.

For those of you on the fence, I recommend that you read the story yourself before deciding if it's right for your home. I would also recommend that if you give this as a gift, ask the parents if it's ok first so that the parents have the chance to learn more before sharing it with their children.",1.0
Just to let everyone know I much prefer Christopher PopinKins.  He is cute and the story is well thought out.,1.0
"So, I bought this adorable elf, whom my three precious children named ""Buttface"" last year at Christmas time.  Before Buttface arrived in our home I was at my wits end.  My children would write on the walls with markers, crayons and even oil based paints.  They would swing from the light fixture above our dining room table until it finally was pulled out of the ceiling.  We had been dining by candlelight even since until Joey decided to light little Jimmy's hair on fire one night as they fought over who got the red fork at dinner.  We couldn't even have a Christmas tree because Jack would try and climb it, or we would catch Jimmy swinging at it's trunk with his Boy Scouts ax.  I didn't blame the dear child of course, he was merely using his vivid imagination to play a game of ""Lumberjack"".  Instead we would have the Christmas Shoe Box for Santa to put the presents in.  I don't care what anyone says, it was just as festive as any old tree.  Eventually though I realized that my children were not behaving in a socially acceptable way when the FBI showed up at my door because the boys had called in a bomb threat to get out of a spelling test at school.  Terribly upset, I consulted my pediatrician and we both agreed that my children's behavioral issues were no fault of my own and that the ONLY solution to my discipline problems was ""The Elf on The Shelf"".

I brought Buttface out of his box the day after Thanksgiving.  For the entire month of December Jimmy, Joey and Jack were perfect angels.  Cowering in abject fear over this tiny stuffed doll they behaved as well as the baby Jesus himself.  It did make for a few night time bed wetting accidents as they were afraid to get out of bed at night for fear Buttface would be lurking in the hallway.  Not once did they bite the dog, cut my hair while I slept or try to hotwire the car.  It was a new record in our home.  We actually got to have a tree that year and I thought my parenting troubles were over!!  Bless you Buttface!

However, on December 26th, giddy with all the loot Santa had bought, which was a lot since they had been so extra good with the help of Buttface, my children knew they were off the hook for the next 11 months!  They were back at it again, tipping over our refrigerator, trying to bathe the cat in the dishwasher and scamming old ladies out of their retirement by claiming to be princes from Nigeria in some email scam they had running.

So, in despair, I am asking that there be an elf of this nature to spy on my children and keep them on the straight and narrow year round!  I know it would make my life a whole lot easier to know that I had an inanimate object in my house that was keeping my children on the straight and narrow and could take over the parenting duties on a daily basis, not just at Christmas time.  Parenting is very hard work and we need all the help we can get.  If I don't have a toy such as this to teach my children right from wrong under the guise of spying on them and denying them presents if they behave badly, how will they ever learn??  Please, please, won't somebody think of the children!",1.0
What I ordered is not what I received. There was no book and the elf was a cheaply made stuffed toy that I would expect to sell for $6. Returning to seller.,1.0
"Yes my children loved this, but I thought it was creepy.  This sounds like a wonderful idea until you get sick of moving the stupid elf everynight.  One night you'll lie awake in bed and remember, damn it, I forgot to move the elf.  Then wait until the kids tell their other friends about ""their elf"" and their friends don't have an elf, and then they call your kid a liar.  Year after year until you can't take it anymore and you can't move the thing another 30 days another year and you finally tell them that you are the elf on the shelf and then your kids cry.  I'm not making this up.",1.0
"My mother bought this for my sons age 6 and 3, after I requested another book about Elves.  I was looking for a story about ""real"" magical elves that live in the forest and create a sense of wonder for children.  This book was written by a teacher whose job is to obviously find any way to make kids behave.  The ""songs"" and story are about behaving properly or else.....the elf will report to Santa and if you're ""bad"" no presents for you on Christmas morning!  There are examples of kids behaving badly throughout the book, no positive messages.  If you believe children are inherently bad and need to bribe them to behave you may enjoy this farce of a tradition.  I had my mother return this book.  I would never expose my kids to this teacher's school like behavior modification especially as we prepare for Christmas.  ""A Christmas Tradition?""  What a joke!

If you truly want your kids to behave, treat them with respect, or read Alfie Kohn's book ""Punished by Rewards"" to learn how this type of discipline really affects kids in the long run.",1.0
"We bought this for a new family tradition to start this year with our 5 yr old DD.And read the book to her and then let the elf appear the following morning. She didn't see the box or anything associated with it being a 'toy'.We thought this would be a lot of fun and a way to get her to make sure she was making the right choices at home.
We placed him on the fireplace on her stocking holder and it took her 2 nights to find him. Once she did we played like we didn't know what she was talking about. She kept telling us that she wanted to play with the toy elf on her stocking holder. We told her we didn't know what toy she was talking about. So we read the story again and I pointed out that he needed a name and maybe then we could see him too. She went through names and then didn't want to name the toy because that was silly. She wanted to take him down to sleep with him. I read the rules from the book over again to her and she still wasn't taking it seriously. She kept telling us that he was just a little toy elf and that she knew he wasn't real.
So much for having fun with this tradition. I hope tomorrow we can convince her that he is going back to report to Santa but I think that I wasted 30.00 on this dust collector.",1.0
"I work in a store that sells 'Elf on the Shelf'.
There is an accompanying video, which has a song:

""Elf on the Shelf is watching you,
what you say and what you do.
Elf on the Shelf is judging you,
each and every Christmas.""

Talk about accustoming a child to a moralistic police state! The video is filled with testimonials by children and adults, all of which sound just as canned and paid-off as the majority of those on Amazon.

Who would do this to their child? Only someone with severe control issues, who wishes their children to remain in a state of constant, paranoid pliancy. Big brother for the kiddos.
Do the little ones a favor, and treat them like full human beings with the capacity to learn a balanced approach to right and wrong through trial and error. Not like pets that need to disciplined through fear. They'll grow up to be better people.

(Not to mention, if you have to do this to someone-- I'm assuming you're a sadistic jerk-- then at least spring for a nicer looking elf, and not a cheap piece of plastic like this one).",1.0

I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the ""rules"" no one was really engaged in the ""play"" aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an ""icebreaker""/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly, not that much fun.

"$50 is outright robbery for this.

Anyone considering buying the Character Trove, would have already invested plenty in previous sets, and to launch what is essential for anyone trying to tote around the whole set, $50 is greed at its worst. Lower the price and I'll redact my review, until then, shame on Slugfest Games for gouging its fans for years of patronage, I hope their own greed fosters their own undoing.",1.0

"Don't be fooled by the fancy name: this is nothing more than a list of questions.  There is nothing about this game that helps 'teach' conversation.  I purchased this game as a Speech Therapist to use with my students.  I would not purchase it again, as I have many other lists of (better) questions.  Here are some examples of the questions:  1. Have you ever looked after a sick animal or bird. (Yes/No question. Does not encourage further conversation.)  2, What do you do if it is hard to go to sleep?  3. What do you find difficult to speak to adults about? 4. Do you have a nickname? Do you like it? (again, Yes/No questions) 5. What is the most important difference between boys and girls? (REALLY?! Ask this to a kid?!)  6. Which smell do you like?  7. Do you have chores and do you do them without being reminded? (Yes/No.)  8. Your favorite song? (poor question grammar!) 9. The first song you learned to sing? (Poor question grammar!)  10. Work and Play. What do you think is the difference?
11. Which do you get more of, praise or criticism?  For this game: Criticism.  It disobeys the first rule of getting kids to talk: ask OPEN-ENDED questions, not questions that can be answered with yes or no.  It does not teach proper question grammar, appropriate question topics (some topics are  a bit strange!), or how to ask follow-up questions.

"There are many wargames out there.  This is not a good one.  It is the ""monopoly of wargames""... meaning that it's slow, bores people halfway through, and doesn't have enough variety to hold the incredibly long play.  There are always six teams, (if you play with only two people, you still need to have six teams, one person just plays multiple teams) so it takes a while to have your turn come around, with most of the game being waiting for tiny effects.  It is also very poorly balanced for a game, with some people having twice as many cards as other people, and once you run out of cards... you can't do anything anymore.  It also has an annoying ""quiddich"" game playing style... you can collect as many victory points as you want, and some players have this as their sole function, but it won't matter because the team that wins will be the team that captures the golden snitch - something that one team can do vastly easier than the other due to the poor balancing issues. (if you capture two enemy capitols you win the game, and geography dictates that the allies can do this easily, with two enemy capitals right next to each other, while the axis has to cross continents in order to capture a second capitol.  The allies can also just wait out the axis, since two of their three armies have twice as many cards as all their enemies).  They tried for historical accuracy with this game... and I suppose they got it, but they sacrificed gameplay along the way.

Please put this product back on alibaba.com with other fake goods.",1.0
"This produce is so cheaply made.  Flimsy, hard to hold onto letters, half of which aren't even printed in a way you can tell what they are. A ""T"" for instance looks like a 'j'.  Not user friendly, therefor we would not to get it out to play and have fun with.  Ugh.",1.0
"Well my board came with a misprint. On the bottom where it should be triple letter score it has it written as a triple word score. So now my board has an extra triple word score.. Bummer. Also, the game board is cheap and it is not tile lock at all. There are just little pegs that somewhat keep the tiles in place, but most certainly do not lock. The face of the board is just a sticker put on top of plastic. I like the fact that the board is smaller than a normal scrabble board but some may not. Regretting purchase, but at least I can play Scrabble (kind of).
Cons:
Cheaply Made
Misprinted Board
Not locking tile

Pro:
Smaller board",1.0

"Worse than the cheap, featherweight tiny plastic tiles is this edition's board layout error. In the 10th column, 14th row position, the manufacturer has errantly placed a dark red triple word score rather than a dark blue triple letter score. They proudly post their defective board on the photo that is on the box's exterior.",1.0

Pieces don't lock on board and easily disturbed. Small  not as expected......... Poor quality.....,1.0
I really don't like this board. The pieces are difficult to fit in the squares and even more difficult to lift to see if there are bonus tiles beneath a letter. I will be returning it and order something better,1.0
"very small board, stands, and letters",1.0
"I already own the deluxe board that spins and a travel board that folds up.  I asked for this for a gift because I thought ""Tile Lock"" meant the tiles stayed in place when you moved it around.  That is not the case!  The tiles stay much nicer in the traditional boards with wells for each letter.  If you are looking for a smaller board, I recommend the basic travel size that folds up, it's much more convenient.",1.0
"I am very disappointed.  Doesn't ""tile lock"" sound like the tiles will stay in place even if the board is vertical?  Well they won't.  Since I wanted this to be able to play with my bedridden 93 year old mother, that was the one thing I needed it to do.  So sorry I didn't read the reviews first.",1.0
"This game is too cheaply made to be recommended to anyone, kids or adults. But again, ""you get what you pay for"".",1.0

"I was expecting wooden tiles, but the tiles in Tile Lock Scrabble game I received are cheap plastic with open backs, so there is not even the feel of a smooth, solid piece.  I was disappointed that the manufacturer made a decision to save a few cents by delivering a poor substitute.",1.0
The board is a bit too small and the tiles don't stay on as well as expected.  Shifting the board still upsets them.,1.0
Board is too small and tiles are too small to maneuver even with small hands.  It is not worth it.,1.0
"Very poorly made.  The tiles do not stay on the board as advertised.  Cheap flimsy board also.  Love Scrabble, however, the original board and tiles are much better that this ""lock"" model.  I returned it for credit to my account.",1.0
The board is TINY! it's almost like it was made as a travel set. I returned it because I would never play it with that small of a board.,1.0
"I purchased this product for the stand. I had only had it for 2 hours when I my iPad 2 fell from the stand onto my tiled floor. Now the screen is cracked, and I cut my fingers each time I play Angry Birds. Not impressed, I strongly discourage others from buying this product.",1.0

"I'm a Backer from the Kickstarter currently working through trying get this ripoff refunded.

Pro:  It's Robotech

Con: It's Palladium Books

It's made as el cheapo as possible with all possible quality shaved to save pennies.

The minis are not ""mouth watering"" nor ""high quality"", they are ABS (normally cut in 1-3 pieces for minis this size) plastic hacked into 12+ pieces on the best design and 20+ on the Valks...on figures 1.5-2"" tall!

The sculpt cuts are extremely badly done (from using the wrong...but cheap...manufacturing process) and require lots of extra time on the part of the builder to repair the highly visible seams set in the worst places.

The flight stands, instead of being standard acrylic, are opaque ABS plastic that all attach at the same place on the minis, so that any ""flying"" minis look like they have lost bowel control.

Neutral/Haven't Covered:  The rules appear to have issues, but I haven't even bothered to read them yet.  Why?

 I've got stacks of miniatures armies on my shelves made by different people at different times for different games.  Even the worst designed of any of the minis in those armies would be easier to assemble & paint with more posability and options that this dreck from Palladium.  This game went from most anticipated to least likely to ever play in the local stores.",1.0
"Mediocre game rules, lousy miniatures.  You'd be far better off with BattleTech, CAV or a half-dozen other mecha miniatures games.  Building the miniatures is not for the faint of heart with tiny, unnecessary parts, gaps and lack of interesting poses.  Company support has been dismal to non-existent; you won't be able to play the campaign listed in the core book because we are still waiting on pieces to be released (2 years later) for the game.",1.0
"As a member of the Kickstarter, I was appalled by the poor quality and corner-cutting short-cuts this game took.  The book is poorly organized with vital information seemingly not present (the required information is on a set of cards that comes with the game, not included in the rule book).  It is overly complex for a war-game, much like the miniatures.  The rules waffle between too complex and too simple as if the original rules were simply thrown out and re-written by someone who has never played a war-game, only out-dated RPGs.

I strongly recommend you look elsewhere for an entertaining game.

For those BattleTech players looking for unseen 'Mechs, don't bother.  The Veritechs are simply too large to be Stingers and Wasps.  If the parts for a Super or Armored Valkyrie were in the game, they would make good Phoenix Hawks and Crusaders, but, those parts are ""included"" in the endlessly-delayed farce that is Wave 2.

Don't bother giving Palladium Books your money for this pile of garbage.

Edit:  This company, Palladium Books, currently holds an ""F"" rating from the BBB (http://www.bbb.org/detroit/business-reviews/books-new/palladium-books-inc-in-westland-mi-13022151).  Make of that, what you will.",1.0
"The game says ""fast and easy game play"" but that's after you spend 3 months putting together microscopic miniatures that are impossible to properly assemble.
These are single pose models that lack the quality of any modern company. I supported the efforts to make this game, but the origonal picth was for pre-painted single piece minis like DnD mins. sadly we are given a 1/285 scale that is only good for the first era, and will make the rest of the series unplayable. the Logan will be less than an centimeter tall.
***EDIT***
Now it seams the Ambassador Staff for Palladium Books is commenting on the game, These are Volunteer Staff Members that Palladium coordinates to run demos and defend Palladium's honor online.",1.0
"had no idea the extent you have to go through to put this together.  Hundreds, and I mean hundreds of pieces - that DON'T snap together.  It will take my teen age son and I months to put this stupid thing together.  Horrible plan, horrible.",1.0
"After a decade of pre-painted precise miniatures available for D&D, X Wing, Wings of Glory, etc. we are treated to poor quality model sprues. A game based on a TV show that you need to be 40+ to remember watching, and they offer over priced tiny models. I no long have the time to make this many miniatures to play the game. The ones we tried to build ... some pieces are too small to pick up without tweezers, round pieces for square holes, seam lines running through almost every major piece, no identification of parts on the sprues, decals the size of a felt tip pen made period ... the Zentradi pods packs of three that come with four of one type of leg and two of the other ... terrible positioning of the Veritech battleoid legs ...

I am saving you from reading the small print on the box. If you are a modeler and love putting together Warhammer miniatures, you will love it. If you are too busy working to spend hundreds of hours fighting poor model designs or might have older eyes and hands than when you last saw the show ... avoid this. Go buy X Wing, Wings of Glory or some other table top war game, where the miniatures are finished and ready to play out of the box. The only thing you get when opening the box is frustration and hours of building badly designed models.",1.0
"Tactical miniature games have some simple requirements.

* decent rule set
* easy to assemble miniatures
* if not easy, customizable minis
* quality materials.

This game fails on every mark. The rule set has units roll a single D6 and a 1 always misses and a 6 always hits. So 1/3 times, it is pure luck for what happens. The units use true line of sight which means modeling your units closer to the ground gives them better cover.  Not that that will be easy as I explain below.

The models themselves are about 10 pieces more than needed with the seams in flat armor spots, leaving horrible lines.  Of you are lucky you will not snap the super thin antennas and cannons on some of the models.  Good luck transporting them to a game, though. They'll be broken fairly quickly from that.

On top of that, they don't even allow a range of poses, you can't easily change their poses. If you are great with knife, putty, and tweezers, you may be able to do some modeling. Maybe.

They were kind enough to include a color guide using hexidecimal codes for the colors. Of course since no paint manufacturer fire mini paints uses this, you can safely ignore that.

Overall, this thing is a complete failure as a miniature game and I feel bad for having opened it to check since I can't send it back now.",1.0

"Another reviewer(Zambia)already explained that it was very poorly delineated how one is actually supposed to play; I would second, third, fourth and fifth that, as there were four of us trying valiantly to make it through the inconceivably poor instructions and we never did to our satisfaction. I am getting rid of the game after only one attempt (a whole year ago) as it has never been one we wanted to play again- it certainly doesn't measure up to the hopes of one who thoroughly loves the movie.",1.0

"This game is about as mindless as it gets. With few exceptions, turns tend to churn out without player input and without fun. I tried it with a group of three, but the other two players had a hard time understanding how each turn was meant to play out. After just a few rounds, I realized that I could just play for the others rather than trying to explain the game since no real decisions were necessary!

I imagine that future versions of the game will simply include a button that, when pressed, will play a user's turn. For now, I have to manually perform this action.",1.0
"This game was ridiculously hard to learn, and I still don't understand how to play it.  My sister got this from a yard sale, and we're wondering if we're missing a part of the rules (we have a small booklet with a summary and a more in-depth book).  The rules are obscure, and don't give explanations for what some of the cards are for (for example, we still don't know what to do with the ""book"" card).  White and grey cards are supposed to allow different actions, but we couldn't find the description for that either.  We gave up once we got to Moria.  I personally don't understand how anyone can figure out these rules.",1.0
"Found this game at a Value Village for $2, seems like a good deal right?

Wrong, this game is not really a game, so much as it is interactively telling the story of Lord of the Rings.  No decisions feel important and the game forces you down the path to tell the story the way it was in the books.  If you fail at something you have to keep trying until the story works its way out, otherwise you lose.

Dumb game, ripped it apart and used the pieces for other stuff.",1.0

"Well I thought since this idem didn't have any reviews I would make on for it.

I got this game when I was somewhere around 8 1/2 Years old. I have played and beaten this game about 10 times. It's help kids learn about different types of plants which ones are safe to eat and which ones are deadly. You can geather, fish and hunt.

Graphics: The graphics are amazing very fine and sharp which doesn't happen with most games.

Sound: The sound if wonderful although it sometimes is a little slow, but other then that it's really good.

Pros: Help ppl learn about different plants, fish and wild game.
Is really fun to play and it never gets old.
Has really cool short movies that you can watch over and over again.

Cons: For some reason the rattle snakes always try to kill me.
Can sometimes be a little tricky but if you bye the right stuff you will be fine.

"I got this to show my kids what I used to play in school.  The graphics are significantly better than I remember.  It's still the same decision making, problem solving, luck of the draw game it always was.  It's a fun way to share 'history' with the kids.  I use it to encourage empathy as they can see relatively quickly how their decisions directly impact others for good or bad.",5.0

"Great Game.  Although at first I could not get past the log in screen in the game.  I found a way by looking online, it was very hard to find though. So add this line to your systems host file - static3.cdn.ubi.com 87.248.207.150 - and it should connect.  Also be aware of uplay, they updated it once and the game wouldn't work.  There is a way around updates though just disconnect from the internet and start the game then when the log in screen comes up connect to the internet again and you should be good.  Hopefully, ubisoft doesn't read this and change the format cause I really love this game.",5.0

"I picked this rating because, although this game is redundant in build, the scenarios do change. It is challenging in both multiplayer and single player. You get a world even every so often and only a limited time to do the event. You get mad experience points for it as well.

So if you like builder games that come with some serious challenges, unlike its predecessors, this game will keep you busy for hours and hours and hours. Once you start you keep pushing to get to that new level, that new tech, that new fleet of ships. Ubisoft did good by this one. Pick up a copy and if you want to play together? Just coment and we certainly can arrange that.",5.0
"I bought this game thinking it would be pretty cool and that i might play it for a  week or two and be done.  Boy was I wrong! From the moment I finally got the gamed Fired up (the other commentors on this are right, it takes forever and u are forced to create an account) I watched as it booted up I could tell right off the bat that ALOT of thought went into making this game. If you have ever played Sim city, then this game is a must try as you will easily navigate thru it and its multi layers. I have been playing htis now for a month straight, and I am STILL discovering layers of complexity in the game. There are a few things in the game that could used tweaked, but all in all this is a 5 star game.",5.0
I have played the old anno 1701 AND 1503.  this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game. I found a lot of things lacking such as the sources of power and an inability to store energy with batteries or regenertive fuel cells as buildings in the game need power. Trade is about the same. My main beef with this it requires an internet connection. Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics. It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals. I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this. I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish. I wrote my 2 cents worth on suggestions on anno 2070 wiki and you can read 3 pages on that for game ideas I had.,5.0
This is a very fun game single player is difficult but the multiplayer makes you feel like you lived a sheltered life.  It reminds me of first generation Sim City with awesome graphics.,5.0
"This game is not for everyone.  If you only enjoy constant fast paced FPS games, this is probably not for you.  But, if you've dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot.

There is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series.  Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO.  With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military.  Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available.  You can even go nuclear.  It's pretty sweet.

There are three ""races"" of people.  It's a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs.  The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted.  The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin' oil drillin' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost.  Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research.  The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance.  I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities.

I love this game.  I've always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in.  I've put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing.  The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game.  Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction.  It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year.  I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way.  There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents.

A quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection.  There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I've never even tried it.  Single player is what I enjoy, and there's no reason to be online for that.  Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.",5.0
"This is a great real-time supply chain management game.  However, the play is novel and there is a steep learning curve.  Some reviewers have criticized the campaign for being too restrictive.  That is not a fair criticism.  The first 3/4 of the campaign is basically a tutorial.  The campaign holds your hand from objective to objective so that you can get a feel for how to succeed.

This game really eats up time.  1 hour is about the minimum amount you would want to spend per session.

If you like tinkering and optimizing and losing yourself in a complicated game, then you might really enjoy Anno 2070.

I think this game should really appeal to people with an inclination to programming who like developing and optimizing algorithms.",5.0
I cant stop playing my wife is going to through it out soon. It was worth the money to buy it.,5.0
Great game. Very complex and can get hard to handle with larger cities but i like the challenge. Interesting missions,5.0
Definitely one of the best products UbiSoft has released.  The game is very similar in its interface to its predecessor: Anno 1404 but its story line and the scope of the game is far more developed.  The player is able to vote in world council initiatives that directly affect in-game play as well as participate in random missions that earn the player career points enhancing the player's game play.,5.0
"Loved playing Dirt 2 and I thought the graphics were good.  Purchased Dirt 3 as an addition to the other...and the graphics are absolutely ""Gorgeous""  If you liked Dirt or Dirt 2...you are going to love Dirt 3.  The game was easier to configure with my Logitech wireless rumblepad...and with my EVGA GTX 580, and all detail set to full on graphics at 1920 x 1080 I get over 100 fps.  The game looks good, plays well and is a blast!",5.0
"I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer.  And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.

At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.

Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.  It's the best DiRT so far.",5.0
lot of people don't like RALLY because they already tried gran turismo game. to tell you the truth gran turismo RALLY physic is just boring boring boring. gran turismo only good for racing simulation but RALLY part is suck!!!!  dirt 2 amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt 3 with 3 time more race tracks than dirt 2.  MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!,5.0
"This is a must have for any gamer. Codemasters really hit a home run on this one. I would like to see F1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money. This game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford. I am using a nvidia 460 overclocked, and I have on order a 590. I want to run this game with everything on highest level. I swear to you that even with the 460 + , the graphics are very realistic and I really enjoy racing at ground level. This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!!

December 6, 2011  I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3. Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID 2 in the summer.",5.0

"Yeah, well, the interface on D2 is way more immersive, but D3 gives you many more and way cooler cars. The problem is you gotta pay for some of them. Now that ain't right. Anyway, this is a furiouse game with lots of eye candy and exciting race action (wow, I sound like a commercial.) You don't want to skip buying the xtra cars cuz they're way fine, but jeez man, that's more moola. So the camera work is still weak. Like why can't the playback just playback a good TV view. You miss a lot of action cuz you're getting a close up of a wheel spinning -- big deal (same with the playback on D2.) I'd buy it if I were you, but then there's no one like you... Right?",5.0
"Perfect for me. I used to do a lot of sim racing but it has been a while. This thing lets me gradually shed assisted driving. Easy to tune for good challenges, new skills and constant fun. I might even put another DVD drive into my computer so DiRt3 is always ready to go.",5.0

But to get the full experience get yourself a good steering wheel. Im not talking about those cheap $50 wheels that only turn half way. I got myself the Logitech GT wheel for PS3 and for PC's and it's amazing!",5.0
"I play this game with friends via LAN. It works well, and is a lot of fun to race. I like the fact it's not super serious, and the tracks are varied. It is fun to race in the snow, or on gravel, during rain, sunshine, snow, or night.

I've played some of the single player campaign, but just prefer to play it via LAN with friends. It is more fun to me, to race against people I know than computer controlled cars. Especially as the computer controlled cars don't always seem to realize that you're right beside them, and will hit you, causing you to spin out, wreck, or generally have problems.

One of the more annoying things about this game is that you have to sign up for Microsoft Live, or something like that. You get a predetermined name, which is generally nonsense. And every time you want to play this game, you have to sign into Live. The other complaint I have is that if you want more cars, you don't earn them by being good at the game. You buy them. It seems like every company is going for purchasable downloadable content route.",5.0

I could have ordered the PC DVD from a couple of places for $49.99, but the seller at Amazon had it at a great price. I really like racing games and this is a different format for me, because I usually choose road racing games. The in game trailers for this game, and the option to play Gymkhana in a Rally game is great.",5.0
"I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.
I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...
Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.

As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.

Pros:
- Amazing graphics
- Amazing physics
- Challenging but entertaining races

Cons:
- Gymkhana
- Interface

What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.
I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!
Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.

Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.

Conclusion:
As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.
If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!
In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.",5.0
"This game is by far the best driving game I've playing great graphics, incredible handling and relistic damage. The online play was also pretty good for me. Only issues I had were really minor, I prefer dirt 2 user interface, and dirt had a better soundtrack, but those are just personal preferences and not really relevant to the review. The replay and upload feature is very cool as well. I'm Jason and I drive Manual. Definitely worth the buy.

"Seriously, the game is amazing fun. It has a learning curve, and I recommend you have a really good system to make the framerate playable (I have a Pentium D 3.0, 3.5GB RAM, Radeon 4650 and I have to have it almost set to ""Ultra Low""), but I have already convinced others to buy this.

"Installed the game. Then clicked to launch/start the game. An error message appeared saying game cannot start because ""xlive.dll file is missing"". They should have displayed a message advising the user to install ""Games for Windows Live"" program first (a free download from Microsoft), but instead they just give you an error message and leave you to figure it out on your own. Small print on the game box mentions Games for Windows Live being needed to activate your online profile and multiplayer gameplay but does NOT make clear you may need this just to get the game started!
So, installed Games for Windows Live and launched Dirt 3 for the second time. This time it says game update needed to proceed otherwise it will sign you out. Clicked OK/Proceed to get the game update. This took almost 30 to 40 minutes on my 12Mbps high-speed internet connection just to download the game update. Then you go through a fairly quick install of the game update.

"This collection includes six hardcover guided guidebooks, these are reproductions of the same individual guides Prima released over the past. The only problems are some people report that the ones they received were in poor quality such as upside-down covers, damaged covers and pages, sloppy gluing, but I think if you buy directly through Amazon or Amazon fulfilled sellers then you're less likely to get a bad set.

One drawback is none of the goodies that came with these guides are in this collection, kind of a bummer really. Another drawback is the Twilight Princess guide isn't the 2008 re-release but instead the original 2007 release. A third drawback is that yes they are Prima guides and we all know how much they can leave out information. On the plus side the bookmark looks nice, the box is made of sturdy cardboard, and the Skyward Sword guide is a re-release with additional information added.

So for the Zelda fans this collection is worth owning, I love mine and will use it well.",5.0

"I love the legend of Zelda franchise and my favorite have is twilight princess. Since getting the game again I wanted a strategy guide and find this on sale and bought it. When it came in I was so stoaked about it then opening it was like magic the golden steel plated plaque was a bit scratched but I don't mind it.

The ""chest"" is just awesome and the gold bookmark and gilded edges of the books are so shiny that I can see my reflection in them and I know that I couldn't do that when I bought some of the others when they came out with the games. Oh, and the best part? These books are bigger than the copies I bought when the games came out!!

"Let me start by saying this is the best product I've ever purchased. Only $107.89 for 6 amazing great quality guides in a well built chest and a golden bookmark. These are top notch guides, well written, and well put together!
HEADS UP: There's only 50,000 copies being released, and my number according to the certificate is around 49,400. That's how many they've sold in just over a year. If you want this, don't hesitate.
Also, these guides are going for so much seperately! I've seen used copies go for more than this set alone! Imagine in 5 years.... These will be well worth more than you pay right now.",5.0
Great,5.0
"what a great product!!! tremendous quality in the hardcover guides and comes with a really cool gold plated book mark for keeping your place in the guides and a certificate of authenticity.  have just recently got into collecting and this product really blew me away, awesome quality and quantity for the price and i am not easily impressed, worth every penny.  i only wish it had guides for the NES and SNES zelda games instead of spirit tracks and phantom hourglass",5.0

"There are collectors who have everything. Then there are poor collectors who window-shop online and cry over how much they would love to have these really pricy additions. I gal into the second category. Fortunately< I have been blessed with a wonderful boyfriend who purchased this set for me for this Christmas, and I kid you not, viewer, I cried. I am 18 years old, pursuing a degree in college and I cried over how beautiful this present is. I love these guides. I used to own a wind waker guide back when it was just a gamecube game and I remember that if I couldn't play the actual game, I would sit and read the guide. These are so much better. They clearly i indicate what you are pursuing in each side quest and quite honestly, I think they're worth every penny. My only complaint is that Majora's Mask, as revered as it is, is not a part of this box set. However, maybe with the release of Majora's Mask 3D, they'll release a second box set, including Majora's Mask, Legend of Zelda (Original), Adventures of Link, Link to the Past, Oracles, Link's Awakening, etc. :)",5.0

"This is an awesome set of deluxe The Legend of Zelda video game guides. The box it came in is just great and I'm so happy they took the time to add to some of the books. While I did have some of these books already, the new and thicker Skyward Sword guide is really top notch.

My only complaint is that the box comes full. I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I can't cram inside it with the others, but that's ok. They need to sell the chest on it's own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have.

If you're a big Zelda fan and love the hardcover deluxe guides that they release with each game, this is a great box set and totally worth it!",5.0
Great collectors addition.,5.0

"I've always tried to collect game guides for all my favorite games. Have a bit of a collection of them honestly. Definitely a huge Zelda fan too! I saw this set online and just knew i had to have this! Not only do i have a game guide collection, but i have a separate collection just for Zelda! So this was literally the best of both worlds for me! The bookmark is very cool and the ""chest"" box is a nice storing unit for the books. The books are beautiful! The gold lining on the pages, and the cover of each book is different and gorgeous.  The letter of authenticity is just so exciting! LOVE LOVE LOVE this!

They need to make these for all the Zelda games!",5.0
I just got mine last night and I'm IN LOVE with them!! Absolutely gorgeous and such high quality. I haven't actually used them yet but I will very soon. Something else I love is that each book has designs specific to the game that they represent (like the OoT book has little gold Ocarinas and Shiek's harp in the corners on the front cover). I didn't pay full price for them since I got them during a sale but I certainly would pay  full price for them.,5.0
I love this set. It's the perfect gift for any Zelda fan!,5.0
Gorgeous box set full of the hardcover game books. It contains the most recent copies to go with all the newest Zelda games.,5.0
"This is a must have for a Zelda collector. Even if it just goes on a shelf to never be opened, it looks great! Some of the guides in it I never saw released (Twilight Princess) and I wonder how I missed them. Great buy for the just over $100 I paid. A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.",5.0
"I'm not one to write a review, but I felt compelled to write one for this to help give people an idea of what to expect. I am an avid Zelda fan and a collector to a lesser extent. I have bought the hard cover collector's edition Prima Guide for Zelda as far back as Twilight Princess and gotten nearly every one since.

I had 4 of these books already, and 2 paperback books of the other 2 guides. So in a way I was buying a set of books I already had. Still has a collector and a fan, I could not pass it up and for me, I could not be happier I got this.

In reading some other reviews about this item, I hope to clarify a few things about this set.

1. First off, I will say that my original set did come with a damaged chest. I got a replacement from Amazon, so no biggie and I'm not going to ding a star off for that. It was just bad packaging.

2. The metal book mark is fantastic, and better than I expected. The chest is nice and having the ribbon inside to help pull out the first book is a nice touch. Note it's meant to just pull out ONE book at the back, which if you keep them in order should be Wind Waker HD.

3. As noted, this set does not come with the extra items such as cloth maps that the original individual books came with. Not a big deal to me, but it is what it is. What it does come with, and just that this set is a limited edition makes up for it to me.

4. I want to give a breakdown of these books and how they compare to the original individual ones I have, where applicable.

- The Phantom Hourglass Guide is identical to the original lone book.

- The Twilight Princess Guide IS The revised guide that apparently came out in 2007. I got my original when Twilight Princess came out and didn't even know till I read the other reviews on here that there even was a revised edition. The 16 or so new pages are mostly a greatly expanded and more detailed ""legendary checklist"" at the back of the book.

- Spirit Tracks: This one through me for a bit because the book in the set is about 1/4 an inch thicker than my original, but the contents and number of pages are identical so they must be using thicker paper. The only difference that I noticed is that the table of contents is the very last page of the book. I am honestly not sure if that is an error or intentional.

- Ocarina of Time 3D. One of the books exclusive to this set and never available as a hard cover on it's own. This is a very nice book and one of the reasons I wanted this book. In comparing in to my paper back version, the contents are the same but the page layouts are different here and there.

- Skyward Sword. I did not get this one originally in hard cover, which was available on it's own. But I have read and discovered it's a greatly changed book from the original. It say it's revised and expanded by over 100 pages, but in reading on Prima's website the making of this set, they go into detail about how this book was basically rewritten by a new author and has all new screen shots. It's much more than just expanded by 100 pages. This was my biggest surprise in this set, as I thought the Ocarina of Time book would be the only really unique book in this set, but it's really that one and this one.

- The Wind Waker HD. This book came out individually very recently so naturally the one in this set is identical to the stand alone.

And that is about it. Like a said, a very great set and I am thrilled to own it.",5.0
"This box is a must-have for any Zelda fan. Not only does it include 6 limited edition strategy guides with bonus content not available anywhere else, but it also comes with a beautiful golden etched bookmark and a certificate of authenticity with the limited number and message from the producer of the game. Each book ends up being about 20 dollars so the fact that it's all a limited release, the price is definitely worth it!

As a Zelda fan, I would definitely recommend fans to go out and spend the money because you'll be sorry if you don't! If you're not a Zelda fan, well now's the time to become one!",5.0
"The Legend of Zelda Box Set looks spectacular, awesome, masterpiece & magnificent . It's truly miracle, fantastic & unbelievable & incredible. The guide books inside are very handy & useful. I'm completely satisfied & accepted with the method & way David Hodgson authorized the Legend Of Zelda Full Box Set",5.0
"I'm a huge Zelda collector so this set was a must-buy. It's a bit of a bummer that none of the guides came with their cloth maps like in their original release, but that's a small complaint. The revised edition of Skyward Sword is a big improvement over the original, and the gold metal bookmark is a nice bonus. I'd definitely recommend this if you're a Zelda fan.",5.0
"First off, I want to say that everything about this set is gorgeous!  It all starts with the idea of now your own personal treasure chest to decorate your shelf with.  Once open, there are six hard bound strategy guides that span the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise.

1. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D (First time ever released)
2. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks
3. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass
4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD
5. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
6. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Expanded by 100 pages from the original guide)

All of the books have gilded edges to give a gold sheen along each page.  Most of these guides are out of print and hard to find.  The guides are all the official Prima Games guides versions, which is a company dedicated to making video game strategy guide.  As a result, the content is undoubtedly top notch in every guide to help you find every secret and defeat every boss.

If you are a fan of the franchise, this is an absolutely awesome set to pick upl",5.0

"All the guides are the RECENT Zelda games to be Released or Re-Released
Maybe they will have anther set for the older games if they are re-made!
But for now these are just PERFECT!
Fully Colored, each one has it's own design and color through out the books!
it would have been nice if the book cover colors matched the games better.
Such as Ocarina Of Time's is purple....Why is it Purple? but it does have the original AND mirrored play though so that's good.
It's in the shadow Temple, Spirit Temple Order.
Twilight is a Nice Brown color, I can see why spirit tracks is Green.
I and my husband think Ocarina Of Time book and the Hour Glass book should have switched cover colors.

"This box set is a wonderful addition to any Legend of Zelda collection! This set includes 6 Prima Guides, a metal bookmark, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic-closure treasure chest. The Prima guides included are for the games: Ocarina of Time 3D, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, Wind Waker HD, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The guides speak for themselves, they walk you through all aspects of these games, giving you tips and help to complete the games. All of the books are high-quality hard cover, with gold-edged pages.

"Came on time and was a great purchase. Perfect for any Legend of Zelda fan out there.

"This is a very quality collection of these hardcover strategy guides. I already owned all of them except the Ocarina of Time 3d guide, so I don't mind not getting the other things that came with the originals. Also, I'm not sure why other reviews have complained about this, collector's editions are collector's editions for a reason. If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely. The only thing I could want more in this is if it made the sound from the games of obtaining an important item from a chest when you opened it. That would make this complete. Great product!",5.0
"I was a bit disappointed that Prima didn't redo all their Guides and include them in this set. Just because the games are old doesn't mean they are not loved and well played to this day. It frustrates me that I now have other Prima guides sitting outside this box not in the cool collector's covers that don't fit this theme at all.

I didn't take off for that though because I purchased this product knowing the older guides were not included so that wouldn't be fair. As far as what is included it is perfect!
The chest is sturdy and will last forever if you take care of it and is just an awesome touch.
The book covers are just so perfectly Zelda it is amazing.
The Gold leafed pages are just showing off a bit but Gold is a main part of the Zelda theme so it fits even if it is a bit gaudy.
The bookmark is epic and if it wasn't so big I would use it as an actual bookmark for everything I read I love it so much.
The signed certificate is a very nice feature for collectors as well even if it was signed using a machine (no way that poor guy signed 50,000 of these things).
The actual content of the guides is first rate. The are very complete, have wonderful pictures, and if you want to know how to get a specific item or sidequest or something it is in there.

Wonderful product even if it is incomplete.",5.0

"The box looks really awesome, and with my A Link Between Worlds guide, and the Hyrule Historia, it really makes the collection look great. The strategy guides helped, too. Totally worth it for the collectibility.",5.0
"This is a very beautiful box set! The way the books slide out with a pull ribbon is a nice added touch, the gold book mark, the gilded pages of each book is stunning

The down side is that it's so beautiful it's hard to want to use the books for strategy guides!
It's very intimidating!

I've heard this is the only way to get HD Windwaker guide and 3DS Ocarina of Time?
So if that is true then that will be a selling point for players

The treasure box is very adorable and the magnetic clasping is very nice

I wouldn't recommend using the Zelda bookmark...as it might tarnish easily or get handling marks on it

Even though a lot of the Prima guides don't flow well in some of the strategy : IE they leave parts out or forget to cover some events or omit some map layouts,
I still recommend this for the visual appeal",5.0
"Bought it thinking it was overpriced, well it wasn't. Totally worth my 100 bucks, the books are all amazing, the box has a better quality than i thought, the metal is amazing, super high quality, recommend to ANY zelda fan, even if you already have one of the books, the rest makes up for it!",5.0

"These books are much higher quality than the standard release strategy guides.  Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.  Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.",5.0
"I got this collection cause I needed the Phantom Hour Glass guide in hardback as well as Ocarina of Time for the 3ds cause its the only way to get it. this collection is a really great price through Amazon, I saved about 50 bucks through them.",5.0
"The collectors editions are beautiful books in their own right.  I wish they would do majoras mask as well so it would be all of them since the late 90s but such is life.

My only possible complaint is the treasure chest box should make the treasure finding sound (you all know exactly the sound I'm referring too).  And maybe have the box oversized so it could fit in the Link between worlds collectors edition strategy guide (same size and design as these so is part of the collection.)",5.0
This was a gift to my son and he was very happy with all the different zelda features these books had to offer I will purchase more items as time goes on...thank you,5.0

I was thoroughly impressed by the items in the set. All books are crisp and beautifully bound. The marker adds a touch that seems just right. The certificate is what you expect. The box itself is the only let down being a covered cardboard or some such material.,5.0
Got this for my son who is a big fan. He loves it. I recommend this for any Zelda fan.,5.0
This was a gift for my boyfriend because he is on a huge Zelda kick. He loves it! It arrived early and in perfect condition! The books inside look beautiful and the treasure box looks great too! Less expensive on amazon compared to elsewhere too!,5.0
I chose this rating because this set was a Christmas gift and my son was so thrilled to receive it. The quality of the books are exceptional.  I would recommend the purchase of this set to anyone who is a fan of Zelda's games.,5.0
Fantastic quality product. Completely worth what I payed for it. Everything was very high quality not to mention the exclusives that came with it (i.e expanded Skyward Sword Guide/Ocarina of Time 3D collecters edition guide),5.0

"You guys rock, it's perfect. The price was awesome too; the best price on the web. Thank you Amazon you made Christmas fun this year.",5.0
"Purchased for a 14 year old boy who thought it was the coolest thing ever.  The books are hardcover, sturdy, and free of defects.  The metal plated bookmark very cool, and the certificate of authenticity, while not the best selling point given the high #, was super cool by a teen boys standards.  The box that it comes in is thick cardboard.  This set would have been PERFECT if it came in some sort of wooden crate.  I would have been willing to pay extra for a deluxe version.  As it was, this set was a very good price and made for a pretty darned happy kid on Christmas morning.",5.0
Everything in this chest is just awesome. Love the chest and definitely the metal bookmark that comes with everything else.,5.0
"This set is just simply amazing! All the books are printed so amazing, including the golden page edges. This is a must have for all Zelda collectors who are fond of the games! And the never before Ocarina of Time 3D guide is the ""Wham-Bam-Thank you-Ma'am!"" that completes this magnificent box set!",5.0
Top of the line Zelda collectible item!! A must-have for a Legend of Zelda hardcore collector.  Price was fair.  Awesome,5.0
"But i'm not gonna lie, it sorta just sits there, aging like the master sword. I am however perfectly fine with that. The production quality is amazing. Most of the books i've purchased in the past few months have their papers falling out of their binding. definitely a must buy for fans.",5.0
"It came right on time, This is good for all zelda fans, both readers and collectors. This is worth the price for all zelda fans!!!!",5.0

Gorgeous presentation. Prime shipped quickly and in perf condition. Bought this for my boyfriend who loves the Zelda series and he loves it!! Great collectible.,5.0
Excellent product. The collector in me loves it. The guide books are beautiful and the treasure chest looks good as a novelty in any game room.,5.0
"The packaging for this item was great. Came in styrofoam and air packages.
All books are beautiful and in tack. They do NOT come with the original collectors edition extras, however I was aware of that when I purchased it.
This book set is a new collectors edition all on it's own.
I really enjoyed seeing my number of which I ordered.
I pre-ordered this item back in July but shipping was prompt and exact with dates.",5.0
This arrived a little late  none the less i could not get the smile off my face. Nintendo have put a huge effort into create quality walkthroughs of the Zelda franchise so far cant wait for Majoras Mask Remake,5.0
"Quality material, upgraded version of some guides, very beautiful! It is absolutely must-have item for any Zelda fan's collection !",5.0
"For Zelda fans, for collectors, this product is a (almost) must-have. Even if you don't use the books, they come in a neat packaging, with a note from Aonuma-san.
Prima Official Game Guides always bring every detail of the game, and these books follow that line.",5.0
"I was thoroughly pleased with this purchase.  Considering the great quality, I found that the overall price was quite affordable.  The shipping was fast, and the item was packaged very carefully to avoid damage.  The guides themselves are stunning.  The golden designs give them a very classy look.  The walkthroughs are in depth, and perfect for someone who is stuck, wanting to 100% complete the game, or just for a collector's item.  I also love the golden design of the bookmark.  It is glossy and serves its purpose well.  The chest is handy for holding all these guides, and serves as a nice showpiece. I was also very enthusiastic to receive a certificate of authenticity, included in each set.  If you're a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I would definitely reccommend this before it's sold out!",5.0

"Collectors edition box set with 6 guides for some of the greatest Zelda games ever! just makes wanting to play all of the zelda games over again just to use the guides, the gold laser etched bookmark is a nice touch as well.",5.0
As a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me. As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through. If you love LoZ and own these games get this before they're gone.,5.0
An amazing set of guides. All top notch quality.  Only downside is they don't come with a map that you would have gotten if you purchased the guide when it originally released.  Book mark is excellent as well and the gloss on the chest is epic.,5.0
just a great item to have for any zelda enthusiest. even if you don't ever use them for a play thru they just look amazing and the bookmark is awsome.,5.0
Beautiful box set. Definitely worth the money if you're a big Zelda geek like me. Really happy that the box isn't crappy. That was my only concern to be honest.,5.0
Really love this box set. Everything was as pictured and it's really well made. The only thing disappointing was that it didn't come with the extras you would have gotten if you bought the books separately.,5.0
"This is absolutely fantastic. When I picked up the amazon box at the door, I was taken by surprise by its weight...perhaps I should've looked at that in the description! I gently opened it and unsnapped the magnetic seal to reveal a gorgeous gold-plated bookmark with etched logos. The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope. As others have said, it would be nice if they included room for A Link Between Worlds, but it's not that big a deal. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!",5.0
"I  cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards.
Now, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set.
I love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.",5.0
"Great set for any Zelda fan.
Although I am sad that the maps that came with the first prints weren't included it is still fantastic set!",5.0
"This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance.  Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately).  If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you.

PROS:

1)  Quality:  The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it).  It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed.  On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser.  It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark.  The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances).

2)  Additional Goodies:  The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist).  I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides.  Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly.  Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this:  some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything).

3)  Collectible Status:  The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma.  It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on.

4)  Packaging:  I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one.  The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport.  I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move.  You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping.

CONS:

1)  Lack of Previous Additional Materials:  As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide.  This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule.  While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made.  Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard.

2)  Exclusion of ALBW Guide:  It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have.  This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course available for purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds.  Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount).

BOTTOM LINE:  This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality.  If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence).  And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to.  I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them.  The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.",5.0
"Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the ""upside"" based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol",5.0
A must have collection for any hardcore Zelda fan. Nicely put together hardcover books with certificate and metallic bookmark as well.,5.0
"Unlike the packing for the seperate collectors guides(crappy amazon book envelopes that get into bear fights with ups and ends up on your doorstep in ""used"" condition) this set comes protected to the hilt and looks great. Kudos to prima for the set AND for making sure we got it in great packaging!",5.0
"High quality magnetic chest box! This is so gorgeous and would be an excellent gift for any Zelda lover!
Hurry and get your copy before they run out. Only 50k were made!",5.0
"Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything.
I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great.
The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the ""chest"" the items came in.
For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each.
This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.",5.0
"This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.

My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.

I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.",5.0
"this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!",5.0
"JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!",5.0
This is a very good source book for Edge of the Empire.  Gives some new species and ships and loads of info!,5.0
"The group I presently run decided early that they wanted to run a sort of loose paramilitary outfit. This is their first time playing and my first time GMing...well, anything.

1. Quality
The book itself is wonderfully bound and detailed. The art is wonderfully engaging and lightens up what can otherwise be a terribly dreary read chock full of statistics and text-walls (a la D20 system books.) It contains some great images of weapon schematics to give GMs and players a better idea of what it is they will be getting their hands on. It's new rule sets are a little vague on occasion, but that's fairly normal for such an abstract narrative focus game.

2. Content
This is a GREAT. Book for medium-heavy combat oriented groups. Even if a group isn't focused in such a way, the resources provided here are largely helpful to ideas on theme. It also helps detail mercenary groups who may be working against the PCs, so even if a GMs players aren't currently focusing on getting into big trouble, trouble may find them. It also helps lay out the RP elements for prospective Hired Guns and other mercenary types that do not conform to the class. It has a large selection of new near-military grade weapons, explosives (for which new rules have been outlined) and assault ships.

3. Complaints
One or two introduced elements are incredibly overpowered or, at the very least, raise difficult questions about their limitations. One of the mods in particular allows players to fire a weapon without using hands but does not identify whether it counts as a second or even third weapon in the case of attacking.
But really the biggest problem with both class books so far has been the infamous signature abilities. These range from nearly useless to absolutely narrative breaking, inducing instant, unstoppable mass-slaughter or near invincibility in the case of the HG. That however is my only real complaint, and it is entirely optional. I and my players decided to strike the purchase of the abilities on the grounds that they were severely overpowered for the most part.",5.0
"Breezed through a bit of it but it's extremely exciting. Finally added some new weapon and armor attachments such as the Pistol Grip which lets any blaster or carbine that doesn't have an encumbrance rating be used as a 1 handed Ranged (light) weapon with only a setback die! Targeting lasers and other optics add some cool effects and they've added a bunch of new pistols with high HP for modding out. Tons of awesome weapons and possibilities and I have just one word for armor, ""powered""...

Don't worry, plenty of ships and new attachments for those as well!

All I can say is if you've been wanting to buy a supplement book and haven't yet, this is a great one to start with!",5.0

"This is a very fun game if you like the photo hunt type of games !! The easy levels can still be hard and it is very addictive and hard to put down .Tons of replay value and it is an awesome game to just zone out to . Kids will have fun with it too !

I absolutely love this game.  You may think it is easy to find 5 differences in the pictures but it is really a challenge.  This game will entertain you for hours.  I play it every night. I am still playing the Rookie level which offers just the right challenge for me right now.  Ameteur level is a little more difficult.  I love the Frantic pictures in between and the slider puzzles that you have to complete in order to open more levels of pictures. Get this game. You won't regret it.,5.0

You will learn alot for sure.",5.0
"This is the real Fritz 12 Single core interface.

The boards look great and I love the wonderful remarks the program makes about my play.

You can add your own UCI engines and you have a first class chess interface

Highly recommended",5.0
"As a very casual chess player, I decided to give Fritz 12 a try. The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several ""personalities"" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player.

Fritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more.

The free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos.

Even at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.",5.0
I'm using an older laptop with an XP os .That means there is no Microsoft Chess Titans game installed .I was having Chess withdrawal symptoms and needed a Chess game in my laptop. So I purchased Fritz 12. Excellent program with a large amount features. Inexpensive and a lot of bang for the buck. You will not be disappointed.,5.0
"This is the old edition, but it's great and a great price.  I've come from a background of playing Chessmaster and this old version is cheaper than the typical Chessmaster offering and much more of a power-user type of software.",5.0
"I just installed this a few days ago; already I love it. I've found the user interface fairly intuitive: So far I've learned how to set playing levels, find and play the tutorial videos, play tournament-style, view and print score sheets, and more. When I ran into confusion with the user interface or options, the help system provided the info I needed.

I'm running the single-core version on a dual core Thinkpad under Windows 7 Pro. Some people had trouble installing or running it on Win7, so I hope my experience will help:

To install, I ran the installer (setup.exe) in administrator mode and selected the ""allow this application to modify the hard drive"" option.

To register, I entered the product serial number from the label inside the case and the validation code displayed in the licensing dialog box. (NOTE: This step could have clearer instructions I suppose, because it took me two tries to get it. The first try, I just entered the serial number and clicked OK. That resulted in an error message but the program ran anyway. The second time I ran the app I again got the licensing dialog box, and again entered the serial number, but this time realized that the dialog box was displaying a code in large funky letters. Entering this code in the field next to it--after entering the serial number--worked.)

Now I can run the program with no license dialogs popping up, and I don't have to run it in compatibility mode either.",5.0

"The Fritz 12 Graphic User Interface is infinitely easier to use and understand than the Aquarium GUI, and you still get that totally cool 3D board option which Aquarium doesn't have. I totally agree with all the excellent things other reviewers have said, but do consider this: On June 10, 2011, World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand told Chessvibes.com his preferred engine was Houdini over both Rybka and Fritz. Deep Fritz 13 (not 12) now has Houdini 3 installed into it and is the ultimate way to prepare for an OTB tournamemnt by weeding out any inconsistencies in your favorite openings. Deep Fritz 12 is still important however since you can install the free Houdini 1.5 download (ELO 3250) or the Houdini 3 Pro version (current CCRL rating 3347) in the Fritz engine management tab under the:""create a UCI engine"" option. Why is a high ELO rating so important?Because when you go to your next OTB tournament, rest assured at least one of your opponents will have his openings down pat with many new ideas and  all inconsistancies worked out well in advance and approved by the worlds strongest engine which is Houdini. If you prefer to rely on the weak main lines and sloppy analysis found in both the ""Secrets of Opening Surprises"" or ""Dangerous Weapons"" books then you may learn the hard way (as I did)by losing many games after reaching terrible positions during the critical opening stages of the game. So I agree with all the good things said about Deep Fritz 12, but its really the excellent GUI(Graphic User Interface) provided that makes Fritz invaluable in creating a truly powerful opening arsenal that will give your opponents something to think about.",5.0
"Fritz is the best there is, that is the short and the long of it. Chess is a mind sport,and so no software can force you to become a better player without you having the right mindset. Having said that, Fritz offers you all that modern software can for chess improvement. Miles ahead of Chessmaster in my opinion. I've owned chessmaster for a while and it is worth the money, if nothing else, with the Josh Waitzin tutorials. Chessmaster has great graphics, but everywhere else, Fritz wins out. Use a combination of Fritz and chessbase light (freeware downloadable online), and use playchess.com for human vs human play and its a win win situation. Great product!",5.0
I have been a Deep Fritz user for many years.  I have others in the Deep Fritz 8 era but Deep Fritz is my favorite and I am well pleased with 12.  Fast shipping as well.,5.0
"Fritz 12 is an excellent chess program. I'm an intermediate level player (chess club strength) and I find Fritz to be an great companion for analysis, casual play, and finding out about recent activities through the ""Playchess.com"" subscription.
The installation process was very smooth and it worked right off the bat. However, the update didn't work at first (update 12). It wasn't until following updates (version 17, I think) that it was able to finally work as it should have. Sometimes the audio features get messed up (the clock continues ticking even when you are not playing, no sound comes when you move a piece, the funny comments don't work, etc.). However, these minor bugs don't affect the important stuff, i.e., the chess playing and analysis.
Playchess is a great place to go find out about news, playing with other people, and fiddling around with the tactical exercises.
In short, an excellent purchase for the price. I would recommend it 100%!",5.0

It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.",5.0

"This microphone is unbelievably good for what it is. It's not studio-quality, but you simply will not find a mic this good for less than $50. The only problem I had with it at all was trying to get it on a mic stand (since it doesn't have a screw) but even that wasn't hard to overcome.",5.0

"With many brands of microphones to buy and choose from this worked great and for under $10 is a steal. I have a wii and the response time was accurate,as well as the sound quality. I would definitely suggest this brand (or Konami they work well too) if your looking to play singing games. If there is concern about the length of the cord it is long enough for me to sit on my bed and sing which is about 31/2 feet from the tv.",5.0

"Good Mic at a reasonable price. So far, So Good! Will see how long it lasts in the hands of 3 and 8 year olds!",5.0
"I've used this for both Rock Band 2 and Band Hero.  My wife loves karaoke and singing, in general, so she naturally loved the idea of singing in games like this while I played guitar.  However, prior to purchasing this microphone, all I had for her to use was my headset plugged into the controller.  It worked, but it was very clumsy, especially in Rock Band 2 for the parts of the song where you're supposed to tap on the microphone in rythym with the beat.
So I purchased this as a Christmas present for her and she absolutely loves it.  It took us a few minutes to realize that a controller still needed to be plugged in for her so that she can join in, but after that, it's been smooth sailing/singing.  What's really nice is that the cord is long enough for her to stand back a good distance from the tv.",5.0
This product was exactly as described and works great with my daughters Disney Kareoke XBox 360 game. Very happy with the mic sand the price was fabulous!!!,5.0
I purchased this mic to use with my Xbox version of Bandfuse and it works perfectly.  Construction is solid and the mic was well packed and timely shipped.  No complaints!,5.0

I am happy with my choice to purchase the official usb logetech ea microphone for my wii. It is a fun item.,5.0
"Been using this for about a year off and on.  It doesn't get the workout that our guitar and keyboard do, but it's still hanging in there with me, a 7 year old and an 11 year old putting it through its paces.  Still works really well on our Wii.  Surprisingly so, as a matter of fact.  The only thing that is odd is that the microphone had a label on the side that said something or other about a ""Disney"" game.  I forget which one.  It doesn't actually say, ""Rock Band"" on it, but we don't care.  It still works just fine.",5.0
Works great now me n my daughter can sing together it arrived way b4 date was suppose too very happy with purchase,5.0
"No problems to be had with the mic, it's relatively cheap and works perfectly well with Rock Band (all that I have used it for).",5.0
"Great buy, Works Perfectly with both rock band and guitar hero, cord is long enough to sing anywhere in the room with out inconvenience.  I was so glad to have found this after buying a rock band set brand new from the store and the mic did not work.",5.0
"We plugged this microphone into the Wii and it just worked. We find USB easier to deal with on the Wii than using the microphone jack.

With all the noise of the games such as Rock Star, I can't really tell how good the audio quality is, but that also means that it is good enough for Wii.

It seems like it is well made, but we have only used it 10 - 20 times, so I don't know how it will hold up over time. The previous two microphones (different manufacturer) didn't last long before we had to start holding the cable in certain positions to make them work.

This microphone does what it is supposed to. Nothing lacking.",5.0
i have had no problems with this product at all. it works like i wanted it to. its great. i use it all the time. thank you a lot! its also great becuase the usb cord allows me to use it with all my games that need a mic. the wireless one do not. so thank you again for this wonderful mic.,5.0
"Works great!

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have ""harmony"" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.  For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in.  Just don't expect a good score ;-)",5.0
I ordered this to use with my Wii and was nervous because some many reviews said it wouldn't work with my systems. I plugged it in and it it worked!,5.0
"i got this microphone to rap because it usb and really i felt dumb for buying it cause its for a guitar hero game and its 12 dollars but it works like a pro mic i just needed a op filter and a stand and i go those the same day i bought the mic and i got them all at the same time i was impressed im a rapper and i loved this mic so i recommend this mic for podcasting,vocals,rapping,or even the real use rock band",5.0
"This microphone is better than the original that came with the Disney:Sing it game.  The audio quality may be the same, but the build is noticeably better.  Heavier feel and better cord connection into the microphone.  A definite must if you have more than one kid or if your kid's like to have friends over.",5.0

"I was initially worried that this microphone would not be compatible with our Wii Beatles' Rock Band game, but it works great with our system and the kids love it!
Now we can have three vocalists, along with the guitar players and drummer. It makes for much more fun when more people can join in the performance. I recommend this microphone with the highest confidence that your family will love it too!",5.0
My microphone stopped working in the middle of playing Rock Band with friends and I was able to replace the microphone with this version for cheap. Product works great with my wii and was shipped fast.,5.0
I got this microphone after my microphone that came with Rock Band fell apart (the wire became loose at the microphone). I like it better than the original. It is a little more sensitive so you don't have to have it right next to your mouth and easier to handle as it is shorter. I am really surprised that it cost so little and works so well.,5.0
You need a microphone to play Lego Rock Band so we recommend this one!  We also ordered the mic stand so we can play and sing at the same time!,5.0
I bought this mic hoping it was as good (if not better) then the Official Rock Band 2 Mic. I found it to be better! It keeps my voice in tune very well and is very sensitive to sound. The transaction with the seller was smooth and fast! Excellent Buy!,5.0
We use this when we want to vocals on Beatles Rock Band and it's great!!,5.0

Worked perfectly. This is exactly what I needed to get my Wii to connect to my high definition television. Thanks!,5.0
"This is exactly what I needed.  And I got it cheaper than in a store and that is if you can even find it in a store.  Would have had to wait a week for them to order it, but got it in just two days and my boys and I were off battling dragons.  :)",5.0
This works great.  It is exactly what I needed to connect my HDTV to my Wii so we do not need to switch wire between the DVD player and Wii.,5.0
It's not hi def (due to Wii limitations) but the colors are crisper and there is a LOT more detail.  The quality difference is similar to upgrading from VHS to DVD.,5.0
Cheap solution to improve video quality for the Wii on HDTVs. The picture quality is better than what we get from component cables from our DVD player.,5.0
"This was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received. I recommend it, if you need one.",5.0
"Fits the wii perfectly, nice and tight.  The rca jacks are little cheap, but they the grab and hold just fine.",5.0
Great alternative to 1080 Tvs. I upgraded my TV but the old connectors made the connection look fuzzy. With this cable I can get 480p which makes games and netflix look great (dvd quality) on my 50 inch HD Tv.,5.0
If you need an rgb interface this really works good. My new tv didn't have the yellow video hookup. Just use it for Netflix I only play xbox,5.0
I needed this to connect to my LCD LED VIZIO. It works.  Not much more to say than that. I found no fault with it.,5.0
"This cable is something Nintendo should include when buying brand new Wii. Product is made well, easy to connect and works great!",5.0

"the cable is of good quality, and the package came quickly.  no complains here.  it also gave the tv a better picture compared to the standard AV cables.",5.0
great component cable for the Wii.  makes hookup easy and can be used for other components...heavy duty...quality...shipped fast and was a great price...,5.0
"Original:

The cord arrived quickly and just comes in a plastic bag inside the box. I bought this cord to have a spare cord and decided to try component cords instead of composite.  The cord works and does help make the picture a little crisper than the regular Nintendo Wii cord. Between the cheap price and the picture quality I get I'm definitely happy with my purchase.

Update May 7, 2013

After using the cables for a while I occasionally get a green tinted screen when I load my Wii, although I've been able to get it to go away restartig the Wii and replugging in the cords. Also after using my Wii to watch Netflix more I can say that the color hasn't bee great and is not very accurate to when the show is watched on my laptop or through original broadcast. I also can't really say that its the cords or the Wii that is going bad and making the color go bad. At some point I'm going to try to borrow cords for a friend and test it out. Ultimately though the cords were dirt cheap compared to other I looked at and I would not be surprised or even mad if they went bad after being used for a while.",5.0
This cable is well made and designed to last. The cable is better then the product it is used to attach as WII does not support 1080p.,5.0
"The movers packed my Wii cables in a separate box so I couldn't find them. I ordered this as it would be quicker and I wasn't disappointed. It is inexpensive and it works. I did have my Wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and sometimes it is better.",5.0
"This component cable was exactly what I was looking for and was a great price! Instead of having to get an A/V component box for my gaming systems, I was able to find this. It was a great buy :)",5.0
This is a good component cable for Wii. The picture is much improved. Connected to Sony 46inch 1080p LCD. I would recommend this product.,5.0
"I'm glad I purchased this cable, it doesn't necessarily make your games look amazing, but it does allow you to do 480p instead of just 480i, so for how inexpensive they are I think it's a worthwhile investment! I've also read that it makes movies look noticeably better, but I haven't played any to confirm/deny that.",5.0
I purchased this Wii HDTV cable to hook up to my brand new HD TV. Easy installation and I wanted to get the most out of my gaming unit.,5.0
This product is very good and works fine. Buy it if you want it. it lets your we display in HD format of 480p which looks alittle better than normal Av cable it comes with. To the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrence.,5.0

This item would not work on my Windows 8 computer. Waste of money.,1.0
"What a bore! I love this game, but so far only the third edition. The only redeeming feature about this version is that I could play it using Windows 8.

No, I have to first run some updater, OK, I do that, says I need to register on some website, I click cancel because I don't want to do that nonsense nor should I have to, so the game starts over again, says I need to update again, I do, just takes me back to the register online screen.

Really would like to review the game itself but unfortunately I cannot even play it. I know there are other Anno titles out there and was interested in them if this one was fun, but I won't be forced into registering online just to play a game I paid for.",1.0

"I'm an avid gamer, but Anno 2070 is an INSULT to gaming.  It is so buggy and half-finished that the first campaign doesn't even work properly and the DRM is INCREDIBLY frustrating to deal with.

Once you manage to work your way past the massive amounts of bugs and get through the DRM, HOURS later you finally figure out that the game has no real tutorial, so you stuck just clicking around randomly.

"The DRM is atrocious.  No one should buy a game with such a cynical and invasive wrapper.

The game itself seems solid.  The interface is extremely cluttered; their UI/UX designers didn't do nearly as good of a job as they did with previous Annos.  If hell freezes over and Ubisoft decides to buck the AAA trend of putting their games in garish, grotesque cages, I'll be first in line for the DRM-free rerelease.",1.0

Wake up UBI, look at all of your other software title reviews, both here on Amazon and on gaming sites. People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.

"I'm sure I would love the game, if I could play it, I have loved all the Hitman games thus far.  The one star is due to steam.

I do have a high end video card but it doesn't make a difference.  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam.  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business (my favorite option).  I am very good with computers (built mine) so that is not the problem.  As always it's a steam issue.",1.0
"Update June 2013:
Deeply disappointed at the lack of a non-linear open-world environment. But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.

As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.

I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.

==================================================================

Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!

I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!

Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!

You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!

The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.

Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.",1.0

"DiRT 2 was like this.  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.

CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating ""music"" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).

PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.

I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.  Anyway,  just my opinion...",1.0

I insert the cd into my pc and I have being waiting  35 minute and it only install about 25%,1.0
"I wish I had read the forums before purchasing this game.  I bought the DVD version because I didn't want to deal with downloading on slow internet, but I see similar issues reported on steam forums.  I buy games on Amazon or Steam because I don't want to deal with the hassle of pirating.  I thought it wouldn't be worth the time, but this game makes me have second thoughts.  This game was not worth the time, and I've yet to be able to actually play a full race.

It took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed.  I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games.  The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like ""MS games for windows live"") that must be installed separately.  The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don't have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn't start.  I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all.

The game can't be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive.  I find that DVD's scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data.  Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don't see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement.  For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version.  I'll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it's an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can't be played anyway.

Once I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash.  Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn't even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot.

I know some will assume I just don't know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses.  I'm a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience.  All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service).  My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new.  Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn't consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot.  The price for the game isn't high, but don't waste your *time* on the PC version of this game.

If you're a young kid and you've got all of your summer vacation to play around with figuring out installation issues, maybe this will be a good learning experience for you.  If you have a job, and just want something fun to to do once in a while on a PC, look elsewhere.",1.0

"As an avid SCCA rallyx driver, I was hoping to get something that was even a little bit like actually rally driving, but was severely disappointed.  There is absolutely no relationship to driving this ""car"" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward.

In actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt.  To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds.  I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed.

The only workaround I could find was the ""dead zone"", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone.  Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn.  Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that's how the game was apparently designed.

You'd think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car.  Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface.  Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game.

If its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option.  This is worse than even Mario Kart!",1.0
"I bought this game earlier this year and was working ok, but when I filled out the xbox live profile this game runs on. It already had a profile name. I thought it was odd, but didn't think too much into it since the game was shrink wrapped and all and was still playing on my pc. It was my first time using xbox live and existing account name had some racing type ring to it, I figured it was part of the game set up for you to personalize screen name if you wanted to change it. Either way the game stopped working, wouldnt load anymore, and a window telling me that game copy was not origanal. So to me, with the other reviews saying game will not load. Im wondering if people are paying attention to windows saying why it will not load. Im guessing the seller or somebody who works there is taking the games number pass code and making copies. With the low  price of the game whos gonna go through the hassel and demand a refund after 3 or 4 months of having this game. I never bothered to bring this up to the seller, because in the end with the games low price I can see the seller accuse me of the copying. Try and google the seller and its reviews (its been some time since I did this. Dont know if they still have origanal name). I did and they were not good. Who knows this review could have been different if I had contacted them, but with the games low price and what came up after google'n the seller. I doubt it.",1.0

"I have never in my life paid money for a game this buggy

First up, my computer is awesome, it crushes anything I though at it with ease.  I have an AMD II X4 925, 4GB RAM with Raedon 6900, my computer IS NOT the problem

Problems with this game:

#1. The DVD doesn't read properly.  My DVD drive, which has NEVER had an issue with anything before takes about 2 minutes to register the DVD.  Clearly whatever factory they used to burn this disc along with the DRM rubbish did a real fine job.  You must have DVD in drive to play game, so need to wait 2 minutes before can play - assuming it reads disk, which it only does 1/3 of the time ;-/

#2. Windows Games for Live was a friggin nightmare to get going.  By the way I'm a computer programmer by day so I know how to operate technical things.  Ended up disabling anti-virus software, good luck getting a non-technical person to realise they must do this

#3. Game absolutely fries my computer.  I have a friggin Raedon HD 6900!!!  My GPU went to 85 degrees and my CPU to 105!! WTF!?  Ended up turning down graphics level right down to stop my fans going mental

#4. You win a race in career mode and you get spoken to like you're a 12 year skate boarder.  ""That was awesome driving dude, you should totally upload your replay to youtube!!!"".  Um, how about get lost?

#5. Get up a short distance through career mode to a snow track with other cars on it - graphics start stuttering like crazy even though i have graphics on ""low"" on a Raedon 6900!!!! wtf!!?!?  Getting about 10 FPS.

#6. Give up on career mode.  Decide to only play time trial.  Oh game automatically downloads ghost replays of ""world record holders"" - they're all cheats who hack!!  3 minute races won in 26 seconds ummm hello??

#7. Finish a time trial, OK that was fun, now replay it.  Oh graphics start stuttering again!!!  Not as bad as snow race but still annoyingn as hell.  Only way to fix is to exit to main menu and then reload entire race, so can't use replay.

Un friggin believable

"So you just want to buy and play this great rally racing game?  Good luck.  I have a typical Windows XP system with an nVidia video 8600 series card and 4GB ram.  Decent but nothing tricky. I am also quite resourceful and capable of doing things like ""deleting .dll files"" running special installers from third party websites, etc.

YOU MAY VERY WELL NEED TO BE AS WELL.

If your install does not work and the game gives you and error, you may be on your own.  Codemaster's tech support?  Responded twice total. I spent another $30 on a registry and .dll fixer, nothing, then they told me to uninstall a bunch of other stuff I had on my machine and then when I did, wouldn't return my response that their help did not resolve my problem.  Poof, gone.

There is no phone number and their home page is on Facebook.

So I used Google and found their official forum and posted a lengthy message with the details as requested by their forum guide and got NOTHING, no help.

I was able to eventually get it to run through more Google searching for related problems in other games.  Problems that should not exist in today's games.  I had to download and run special installers from a sound card manufacturer and ""drill into"" the Dirt 3 game folder and delete a specific file.

How stupid is this?  And nothing?  No help?  No FAQ?  No fix or patch?  Even more remarkable is that their forum is filled with demands that Codemasters fix the bugs.  Demands for many months now, apparently gone unanswered, literally.

This IS THE FIRST AND LAST CODEMASTERS GAME I will ever buy or help someone with.

I gave it one star for the horrible ""welcome aboard, have fun installing"" for this game and ""one star"" for game play as it has been a week and countless hours spent, with no help from Codemasters, getting it to run, which is not much ""fun."" So One star for fun.

I used this feature a lot to play my other computers with earlier software against each other.  When I emailed Chessbase and inquired why they removed a great feature they replied that it was too much trouble for them to support.
Just lazy German programming.

I thought that software evolved to more features not less?  Isn't that what justifies buying upgrades every year?  Hmmmm...  Well Chessbase ceretainly isn't giving a break on the price.

The Fritz 12 chess engine is only marginally stronger than Fritz 11.  Rybka 4.1 just mops the floor with Fritz 12 in Engine match, it so embarrassingly bad.  One recent engine match had Rybka winning 24 straight games and no draws.  This was with the same book for both engines.

Do to the fact the Chessbase doesn't care to listen to their customers and continue to support features established for over a decade and it's poor showing against Deep Rybka 4.1 I would have to say that Deep Fritz 12 is just not worth buying.

It'd be simpler to spend a few extra dollars to get an official mic than roll the dice with these guys in the hopes that they maybe send the correct model you are looking for.",1.0
"I bought this for Guitar Hero on the Wii. It won't work for Guitar Hero or Rock Band as the system doesn't recognize it. It does however work for ""Disney Sing It"". Strange, since the Microphone has ""Guitar Hero"" labeled right on it. I would've thought the company would at least check for compatibility before making claims or labels.",1.0
"This product was awful, we bought it for Rockband on PS3 and it did not work at all. We plugged it into both USB slots and it did not pick up sound at all from either of them. This microphone is completely non functional for at least the PS3 versions of Rockband, including Rockband, Rockband 2, Rockband: The Beatles, Rockband: Metal Track Pack, Rockband: Track Pack 2, and Rockband: Greenday. I will never buy from this seller again. It was a waste of money.",1.0
"The one that I got (the Disney one) didn't work on with any of my electronics. All of them recognized a device though. When it was plugged in there'd be a device listed either on the PC, Mac or PS3 ""Logitech USB Microphone."" However, none of my devices picked up any sound. After extensive fiddling with settings on all my computers I decided to return it. I think newer OSes as of December 2011, (although my PC has Vista) like Lion and the newer version of the PS3 are incompatible with this microphone... that or it is defective. I also did indeed look for an on/off switch to see if that was the problem but there is no switch.

So... if you are looking for an RB3 / Rock Band 3 alternative microphone for you PlayStation 3, don't buy this microphone. Even though they're hard to find, go to Gamestop to get them (only some of them carry them and the nearest ones to me are in Compton, lol).",1.0
The microphone I received was used and said Disney on it. It was not compatible with any Rock Band game.,1.0
"i had read a review here to make sure it works for rock band 3 + ps3 before going ahead with the purchase.  tried this mic today and it didn't work...  the system simply did not recognize the mic and keeps telling me to connect a mic.

also tried plugging this in all the different usb ports, with or without the guitar wireless extension.  no combination worked.

maybe i got a defective device, maybe not.  disappointed and asked for a refund.",1.0
"I hate being lied to, the pictures for this product are nothing like the actual product i received.  The microphones i received do not work with my xbox 360 either.  Stay away from this product and the retailer Bluemall altogether.

"The battery fits my 3000. It does not hold a charge longer then the factory one. Most times it does not warn you before shutting down the game on low battery, with no chance to save your progress.

I have a 3000 series psp. I bought this because the advertisment says that it is for the 2000/3000 psp. When i recieved it and put it in it wouldnt work. would not even charge in the psp.,1.0
"This battery is a waste of money.  After only 1 week of using it (charged it 4 times) and on the 5th charge- it stopped charging.  The light would go on my psp 3000 and after 5-10 minutes- it would go off and not charge.  Do NOT buy this product.  I should've listened to the other negative reviewers before purchasing this item.

I returned it back with no hassle.  Thank-you Amazon, but please stop selling this item.  Too many people with the same problems will only lose you money.",1.0
"DONT BUY THIS!!!... I thought this would of been an awesome buy and a great deal, but man was I wrong. I was so happy when I got it in the mail and It worked on my PSP 3000 for about a week and 1/2, but then while I was charging my psp with USB cable it shut off on me and the battery did not work... so it basically short circuited. At least it wasn't too much money, but still I basically paid $5 for a paper weight... hope this review helped!",1.0
"The main problem is that the battery is too big to fit and keeps popping out when i try to put it in. i have a psp 2000 and compared to the original battery this one is slightly bigger, and thus, will not fit.",1.0
This battery does not work with PSP 3001. Check your cereal number on the bottom edge of the device itself to see your specific model number. It fits perfectly but does not do anything. Returned with no hassle.,1.0
I bought this battery for use with a brand new psp 3001. It acts like it's going to take a charge for about 3 minutes then the charging light randomly shuts off and the psp cannot be powered on again until the battery pack is removed and replaced with the one from the factory... Thanks for nothing amazon.,1.0
"After hooking this up to my Wii, I encountered buzzing audio and slight video glitches. At first I thought it was simply a connection problem, or else a problem with my television, but after purchasing the far more expensive Nintendo brand component cables, I came to the realization that my bargain brand cable was either defective or simply too sensitive to other devices electro-magnetic interference.

"cable arrived in timely manner. Hooked it up to TV but did not work properly. Wii picture was close to black and white only. Appears that the leads were mislabeled or misaligned as sound only came on when the green video connection was plugged in. Would suggest buying different cable. Not sure if will return, cable very cheap relative to cost of shipping return",1.0

"Ubisoft has made a number of excellent flight simulators/arcade games in the past. I found the original HAWX, while definitely on the arcade side of the spectrum, to be fun and engaging.

After eagerly awaiting the release of Hawx2 (PC version) for a number of months, I received it from Amazon (no local stores had it) to find that it required a permanent Internet connection to play; not just to install, but for actual game play. Since I do not play games on the Internet, and my larger gaming (flight sim) PCs don't even have an Internet connection. I had to return the game, unopened.

While the majority of PC gamers do play on line, there are some of us who don't and have no desire to. I fully understand Ubisoft's concern over piracy, but they are excluding a number of previous and potential customers by attempting to lock down their product in this way. Honestly, it seems like all it will accomplish is to force ""hackers"" to come up with a crack for it sooner rather than later.

After doing a few Internet searches, it seems that A. Ubisoft has done this with several games in the past and B. that there is a fairly loud voice of outrage over it, not only by those, like me, who don't play over the Internet, but those who would like the option of using the game when an Internet connection isn't available. Oddly enough, the same game for Wii or Xbox doesn't have this requirement.

If the game plays like Ubisoft's previous sims, I'm sorry I won't be able to see it. Thanks Ubisoft.",1.0
"THE GAME IS CRAP!
I WONDER WHY THIS GAME IS STILL ON SALE IF YOU CAN'T PLAY IT
I F**KING NEED MY MONEY BACK!
I'M NEVER THIS PISSED OFF AND VULGAR",1.0
"I really enjoyed the previous version of Hawx and other Ubisoft flight ""sims"", however I wasn't thrilled about this game needing permanent Internet connection. Since it's been out for nearly 4 years, I figured ""what the heck"", the bugs would have been patched and it might be worth a try - it wasn't.

The game doesn't work on my PC. Installation was fairly long, but smooth, however as soon as you try to load the actual gameplay, you are rewarded with a ""Failed to restore network connection"" error message. Ubisoft has several solutions for this, including opening the PC's firewall, turning the PC into a DMZ (via the router) or opening several ports on the router. These are fairly easy to do, but despite several attempts and reconfigurations, it still didn't work!

The only other option would be to download a ""crack"" to bypass the Internet requirement, but using unauthorized cracks isn't something I care to do.

I understand that some people have gotten this game to work, and that's great. I tried it on a fairly simple PC which met or exceeded the game's requirements and had a strong Internet connection - still no dice.

Apparently the games current following is pretty limited and the company has lost interest; unfortunately so have I.
Thanks Ubisoft.",1.0
They work great for awhile but now I have had 3 break and stop working completely.,1.0
"I bought this thing, it didn't work, then discovered after much Googling that it is not compatible with Vista.  Great.

On the ""help page"", it says (and I quote verbatim), ""BUT for the N64 joypad, isn't ALL joypad can working steady since the structure of N64 joypad is very complex, so we can't 100% guarantee your N64 joypad can 100% work. You have to think over it before you decide to buy this device.""

Considering that you can only read the help files (on a CD) once you buy the device, that is not very helpful.",1.0

"I purchased this product to allow me to use the N64 controller on my computer, while playing N64 emulators and it NEVER worked.",1.0
"It's a cool piece of hardware in theory, but it needs to be re-worked. I found out the hard way that this didn't work. I was hoping to play SSB64 online but wasn't able (even after hours of research and searching for drivers) to get it to work on my Windows 7 PC. I finally stumbled upon a page that told me it doesn't work past Windows XP.",1.0
I does not work properly. It only gives some functionality to the N64 controller and the PS2 controller it doesn't work at all. The Logitech controller for PC is an adequate replacement for PS2 but the N64 controller is a custom device. With the right driver this adapter could work.,1.0
"This adapter has not worked at all for me with any N64 controller (I tried two), and barely works with a PS2 controller.

"I got this thing several years ago and I must say it is junk. The ps1 controller aspect worked fine but I bought this for the n64 adapter. That was a nightmare, when trying to calibrate it, the button detection and throddle were all over the place. I just today found that the power port to the n64 female was broken, I resoldered it and to my horror it was outputting 4.13 volts! The range should be 3.20-3.40 volts otherwise you risk damaging the controller. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1.0
"This thing is cheap and defective, DOES NOT WORK on N64 side, When calibrating, says random buttons are being pressed, DO NOT BUY",1.0
"Do not buy from this joke. It says it was new, it was not, I plugged it in, it does not work, I asked for a refund, no response, asked to send it back for my money back, no response. this person is a joke and a looser",1.0
"Look, I went into the configuration to set the controller to the game, but all of the button signals were being sent through the device all at once! Basically, it was pushing every button at one time! Good for those who bought it and it worked. Amazon sells another kindof device that had WAY higher ratings and MUCH MUCH better customer satisfaction rate. May Flash N64 Controller Adapter for PC USB.",1.0
"This thing doesn't work.  It comes with no instructions.  It comes with a ""CD"" with all the drivers on it but nothing works even when you install it.  It doesn't have any configuration instructions or even gives a general idea on what to do.  Don't buy it.  Just buy a used N64 instead.  Waste of money.  I am waiting to return mine.  I will update it if they don't refund it and inform if they are scammers and I will file a claim with amazon.

Just in case you didn't understand DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
"Don't waste time buying this adapter if your running windows 7, and as earlier commented in reviews, the english typed in is exactly as quoted.  so how are you supposed to know whether to buy it or not until you've already bought it?  DON'T BUY this adapter.

 I have since bought a Mayflash n64 to pc adapter. It doesn't require a driver just plug in and ready to go.  i use it for project 64 and device shows up under controller plug in devices.  set map key and works great.",1.0

"The shipping on this thing was fast and reliable, but, as others have discovered, it doesnt work. I bought it mainly for the N64, and it will not calibrate under XP. Ive got the same random button press issues everyone is talking about. I can't understand how this thing got any good reviews, but I noticed all the good reviews are from a year or two ago. All the recent ones say it's crap. I'm inclined to agree. The CD is a confusing hodgepodge of Engrish, Chinese, and a few .inf driver files from 2002 here and there. And mine had a piece of broken plastic rattling around inside to top everything else off. I want to send this back for a return, but I doubt they'd give me my money back. I'd avoid this like the plague.",1.0
This adapter requires some stupid software that is for Windows XP 32-bit only and is in CHINESE. There was no indication of this whatsoever. You're a con artist.,1.0
"This is easily the worst thing I have ever ordered! when i first plugged it in Vista recognized it and installed the drivers just fine, and the emulators would recognize the controller, but it would not work. AT ALL!!! Don't buy this!",1.0
"I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64.
Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB.

I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results.

PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers)
Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly.
Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work.

PS2 MadCatz Controller:
Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller.
Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test.

N64:
I had two controllers to test with it.
Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly.
Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly.

Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

"The product arrived, and like others I had problems. I had the random button press issues, and it was definitely on the right toggle setting (on the other toggle setting, it got constant input regardless of state, whereas sometimes I could track which buttons were being pressed on the current toggle). After playing for a little bit, I pulled the four screws out of the plastic and looked at the board. The wire soldering was not well done, and by pressing down on some of the connections I was able to stop some of the noise. Unfortunately, releasing pressure goes right back to random button presses. I'm sure some of these are well put together, but if you order it you're basically going for a crap shoot, at least on the n64 side. I don't have any PS2 controllers to try, so maybe that was done more reliably but I doubt it.",1.0

"I received the game controller converter pretty quickly, considering it's the holiday season.  There was a mini-cd inside the box with drivers and a manual.  I didn't need it though, since I had windows 7 64-bit, which already includes the drivers.  Windows recognized it as a 4-axis 16-button controller.  When I initially tried to use the N64 controller, the calibration test went bonkers, with buttons randomly being pressed and the crosshairs all over the place.  I plugged in a PS2 controller and flipped the switch to the PS2 port.  I had success with this one for about a day, it worked beautifully.  The following day, I couldn't get it to work at all.  Re-installed the driver, reset calibration, even plugged in the N64 controller at the same time, nothing made a difference.  Sumoto had no tech support of any kind that I could find.  I've spent an hour or 2 trying to troubleshoot this thing, and I think I'm done with it.

"I thought that when in the description it said ""Brand New"" that's what it meant. I open up the packaging & the box for the memory card has already been opened & one of the screws are missing from the card. It won't even go into the slot. So, basically I got screwed over.",1.0
I just got everything working and played some games.  After about an hour of playing turns out the thing didn't save anything!!!!! So unless you don't like having anything saved DONT BUY THIS!!!!,1.0
"This product is not actually distributed by Sony. As well, Playstation 2 consoles, to my knowledge, do not have any existing memory cards above the 8MB in size. There's some nasty hack for it that simply doesn't work and this card will never work like they say it does. It's essentially a regular memory card without the 8MB memory limitation, therefore making the PS2 overwrite previous data because the memory card is full, but the PS2 doesn't understand that it's full, thus causing corruptions.

My source of this information? The Internet and the two 16MB memory cards I bought years ago, not off Amazon, though.

Seriously, don't be fooled by this.",1.0
"This memory card Failed at the basic level. My PS2 recognizes that it's a memory card, but it says ""Insufficient room"" Last I checked 128 MB > 90 KB. I could be wrong, but I doubt it.

128 MB = 122880 KB",1.0
It doesn't allow any saves at all. Fiddling with the screws doesn't work at all either. I had to replace it.,1.0
"The product is an actual memory card, so it earned a star there; however, my PS2 (slim) only reads it as an 8MB card (when it does read it). Never will purchase off-brand again.",1.0
"This memory card does not work. I guess I should have expected junk for only $8.00 but I took a chance and was disappointed. Also, the item took forever to receive, even through Prime.",1.0
"Was super excited to see a larger capacity card for the same price as the 8MB Sony one. Well, I guess this time it was too good to be true. It didn't work at all, and we even tried the ""loosening the screws"" trick. Returning this for an 8MB one I guess...",1.0
Memory card had no memory on it. Very dissatisfied with the price I paid for it and what I received.,1.0
Purchased for our slim PS2. Some Guitar Hero games won't see it. Obviously this product is not 100% compatible. Buyer beware!,1.0
"Possibly I just got a defective one, but it didn't work in either port of my new PS2 or my brother's PS2.",1.0
"On the memory card screen it shows it as empty, but as soon as I tried saving my Kingdom Hearts game it says there's not enough room.  WTF???

Amazon, you should make the seller change the manufacturer, the only reason I purchased this was because it said it was a Sony card.  I've learned over the last 25 years or so to buy 1st party only accessories.",1.0
THIS IS A SCAM! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! they take a the case (as seen in picture) and put a 64 mb save card in it expecting you not to find out! these are NOT 128 mb card! they are 64mb cards with a case that tells you its 128!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL END UP WITH A TERRIBLY MADE 64 mb CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS AS MUCH OF A SCAM AS CAN BE!!!!!!!!,1.0
This card never worked...online help sites say to only use Sony brand memory cards.  Don't fall for the large capacity and low price...you will waste your money.,1.0
"Duplicate, cheap product. Won't recommend unless you are looking for a cheap backup to store, play. Retuned these product immediately.",1.0
"I tried using the memory card when I got it and it would not read the card. After a while of researching about how to use a memory card, I found a suggestion to untighten some screws on the back. THAT DOES NOT WORK!! This company is a joke and needs to refund money for this scam!",1.0
"I purchased this product and I give it no stars. It is defe,tive. The information on the card kept corrupting through no fault of my own and now won't even format any information. Am very disappointed in this product and for having wasted my money.",1.0
This memory card did not work can not save any gaming on this card. There is something wrong with the desk,1.0
t he memory card says it has 128mb but won't let me put on 99kb of free space for a game,1.0
"It works only when wanting to, I thought it was initially cause the console was old, so i purchased a new one last week, and it acts the exact same way. sometimes it loads up, sometimes it don't, sometimes it loads up but says its unformated, others, it says it doesn't have enough space for a save, when it has more than 90% of the 128mb still available. and also sometimes it will say no memory card in slot available.  This is so worthless, I think I'll rather use this for a databank sort of holder, and just play off of a normal 8mb one, copy and pasting within the ps2 browser option, cause this is to frustrating to deal with on a regular playing basis.",1.0
Not worth the trouble....this device is very frustrating because everytime you reset the consule you would have to take out memory card again and replace it back in for it to work again...,1.0
The memory card could only save PS2 data on it but the PS2 couldn't read from it. I don't know if it's because Sony's stamp isn't on this or if the PS2 was just dirty. But this product did not work the way it's suppose too.,1.0
"The seller was fine and not misleading but the product is not good.  Easily corruptible data and though the size is good, it's not useful when you can't save anything on it.  Just go get a Sony memory card.",1.0
"When I bought this card, it said Sony 128MB memory card for Playstation 2.....but when arrived, I noticed that it wasn't a Sony card, plus it didn't work!",1.0
didnt work do not buy i shouldve read other comments first wasn't reconized by ps2 couldn't save any game is not a sony brand its a 3rd party piece of junk save yourself and do some research 1st sony never made a 128mb only 8mb their 128 was a 128k,1.0
Not much more to say about this. The product just simply does not work. It really is very unfortunate. Sigh,1.0
Did NOT work (Memory Card was filled with corrupted data that I could not erase). Get what you pay for I suppose. Would be better to buy one sold by Sony.,1.0
"i ordered & paid for 128mb memory card. what i got was a 64mb memory card. thats 1/2 the memory. dispite that, 12 bucks for a 64mb is still a great deal so i'll just keep it and save the hassle of returning it. but i'm still only giving 1 star because i got screwed out of half the memory that i paid for.

so be advised, if you order this product, you might receive a 64mb card instead of the 128mb card. so don't be shocked if you do.",1.0
"I bought this thinking that an 8MB card would be to small. So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.
 The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time.

So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.",1.0
"The amount of data this can store is amazing but I had one huge issue with it that makes me regret buying it. My PS2 only recognizes it for some games. Other games like Genji always say that there is no memory card in the slot. And when it does recognize that there is a card in the slot, it says that it is unable to save the game onto it. Don't get this card if you plan to actually use it as your main memory card.",1.0
"i bought it for the kid's christmas.  they FINALLY tried to use it yesterday.  it was chipped at the connector.  i HATE having to take things back, sending or taking things back to the store (especially inexpensive stuff) wastes gas and/or postage.  (and also it wastes my time).  so i'll just use it as a paperweight.  however, i won't be buying this type again.  i live in a rural area.  it's quite a drive to the post office.  i wish that amazon would come up with some policy that you didn't have to send a broken thing back.  just more trouble than it's worth.",1.0
"This memory card is absolutely horrible... It loses saved games, misreports its storage size and is completely incompatible with various third-party products and software.",1.0
"I would highly recommend anyone looking for a memory card not made by Sony for the Playstation 2 to cease and desist! I purchased one of these for the additional memory so I wouldn't have to purchase additional memory cards in the future other than a backup.  This card has so far has cost my son and I the entire game of Lego Star Wars Original trilogy and half of Lego Batman due to corrupted data on this card. I still have and use memory cards from the mid to late 90s that I have never experienced corrupted data issues that caused me to lose 20 cars and 8 million dollars in Gran Turismo 1 & 2, and too many levels in many other games along the way.  I cannot truly say wether this is a PS2, game software, or a memory card issue for certain in all fairness. But it's certainly the only time this has ever occurred in 15 years of game play by using a non-Sony made card.

Our PS2 is on a UPS, battery side, and has had no power surges or electrical issues to put forth for additional consideration; we unplug everything during thunderstorms and other occasions of bad weather (Florida).

Please consider before purchasing this product; it's a complete bummer to see everything you've earned wiped clean over two games. It does however give you a great excuse to replay the games to leave it on a positive.",1.0
"At first it worked fine, Then all of a sudden it lost all the memory, My ps2 didn't even know it had the card in. Don't buy this I returned the one I got.",1.0
"this is a waste of money!! it wouldn't save my game,the memory card is empty and it said that i didn't have enough memory to save it. don't waste your money on this piece of crap!",1.0
"The review about a PS2 not reading the card is accurate. I tried the ""screw trick"", but it did not work for me. My PS2 does not recognize the card. This may not be typical of ""ALL"" PS2's, but this 128MB card does not work with my PS2. In my opinion, you are better off buying a Sony PS2 Memory Card. If the card is genuine Sony, You know it will work.",1.0
Fake! Doesn't work on ps2 at all! Don't buy this product! Get the original 8MB SONY version!!!,1.0
"Be warned... the information page indicates that this is a Sony item, but not only is it a third-party item, but nowhere on the packaging does it indicate just who made it!  (Stupid me for not carefully reading the reviews beforehand...)

  By putting the package model number (HC2-10080) into a Google search, I found that nobody else seems to know the manufacturer either!

  Plus, there are multiple reports of the memory being slow and unreliable.  I might just have to return this... $20 for a knockoff, and a probable junk one at that?  Hmm...

Amazon, change your manufacturer line... the Sony name doesn't belong there!",1.0
"this item wasn't great. i thought it would be awesome because it was 128MB but it hardly worked. i felt like i was using an old nintendo console where i had to take the memory card out, blow on it, and put it back into the memory slot on my PS2 and repeat this process until my PS2 will recognize the card. not recommended",1.0
This is not liscened by SONY. Do not get this. It will fail on you at one point or another!!!!!!,1.0
This item does not work with my son's PS2.  How do we return it?????,1.0
"A 128MB card sounds great. And it would be, if it actually worked. I read a few 1 star reviews, but bought one anyway. First I tried to move the game saves from my old 8MB card over. Some copied over, but others wouldn't (with no explanation). Then I tried to play GH: Metallica. Wouldn't let me create a save. I tried another game. Same problem. Waste of my money. Don't waste yours.",1.0
"Ok, so I read the reviews and thought to myself I shouldn't buy it..Well I found it for as low as $11.00 as it retails for like $90.00 on some websites so I thought what the heck for that cheap price, I'd try it anyway..I'm so dissapointed, I don't know where to start?? The box says stereo quality music??So I thought it would be like listening to the radio, um no..It was like listening to a video game..Who gets motivated with music like that?? Then the dance pad is cheap and hardly works right..Its bad really bad..I thought I was getting a good deal and would have fun with it, no..Please don't waste any money..Its not worth a penny...Listen to this review as I should have listened..Very unsatisfied..Its not worth the star I gave it but I had to put at least one or the review wouldn't take..",1.0
I bought this as a gift to my nieces and I was very disappointed.  It did not come with any instructions so we had to try to figure out how to use it.  It seemed very cheaply made and not worth it!,1.0
Was advertised and even referred to as a Dance Dance Revolution tv pad and its not a brand name as advertised. If you are going to refer to a specific product and use the name of the product then sell THAT product not a knock off....just before christmas when there is no other option. We were disappointed that we didn't have an authentic brand name product. It is obviously a lesser quality as far a workmanship and the music and graphics leave a lot to be desired. We will be very careful from now on when purchasing something online to make sure the product is what it is being sold as.....,1.0
"I ordered the Dance Dance Revolution TV Pad (No Console) for my child this Christmas. It was defective right out of the box. Only one of the touch pads worked. Just another example of cheap junk shipped from China.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I was happy that I received a refund for this product.",1.0
Total ripoff! This dance mat was not a true DDR mat. The songs are old & they don't play the real music only makes an annoying beep sound. This was a total waste of money. My daughter was extremely disappointed. I think Amazon needs to not sell from this vendor!,1.0
"JUNK
JUNK

This item is a total waste of money! ""Stereo quality"" music...not! The graphics/music are comparable to the first Atari system my parents ever purchased...in 1976! And...no original packaging or instructions came with it. This was a Christmas gift for our son...I'm so glad we hooked it up before that special day...he would have been so disappointed. Do not buy this item...spend a little more and get something worth having.",1.0
I made a huge mistake when I purchased this.  Out of 1 to 5 scale for video and audio display. Video = 0 and Audio = 0.  Get the real game for the playstaion or Xbox.  It is a lot better and worth the money.,1.0

"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this one. We had gotten an equally awful version for Christmas and my daughter discovered the real DDR system in her vision therapy class at school. It is supposed to be great for cooridination issues. We thought we'd get a ""real"" ddr for home this summer. THIS IS NOT IT. It is even worse than the Christmas one. You can step exactly the same on the pad in the exact same time and way and you'll get random results. Once it says you were PERFECT, next MISSED. Horrible for coordination training since it gives innacurate feedback. False advertising since it is a cheap knock off.",1.0
"This is only an imitation of the DDR, there is not even the name of the maker on the box. I own a kiddie version of the DDR-TV (no console) by Kunami, and the quality of sounds and graphics are way above this one. Here, the ""music"" is barely an electronic tempo, and the welcome screen says 2004...  Don't waste your money, and look for something else.",1.0
"This product is so cheap!  Very hard to use and for the price, I thought it would be not so cheapy made.  The graphics were cheesy and so 1980 Atari like.",1.0
"I rarely get taken, but I did this time.  One song played 50 times.  No instructions.  Pad not in tune with TV movements.  This is going to a garage sale or charity.",1.0
"I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated ""beeping"" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take.",1.0
I feel completely misled by the ads for this product.  This is NOT the same dance dance revolution I constantly see on Nintendo ads and in the arcades like I thought it was.  I should have read the reviews first.  I only hope to get my money back easily from the seller.  I was waiting for this for a week after learning what a great workout DDR is.  This particular product has graphics I haven't seen since the early 90s and you can barely tell what the songs are because the audio is like from an Atari game from the 70s.  There's only one speed and the dance pad doesn't do anything!  DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!,1.0
"This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 ""songs"" all sound the same.  They are not ""radio"" or ""stereo"" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!",1.0
"This is a TV dance pad, not the authentic DDR pad as we ordered.  My children were disappointed in the music, graphics, and the lack of challenging levels of difficulty.  They said it was ""cheesy"".",1.0
"i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game. this has nothing to do with the real Dance Dance Revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name, which is not on the actual product. very disappointed!",1.0
"When I ordered this, I was expecting to not have the quality of the play station DDR. I was shocked to discover that it wasn't even worth a dollar. In my opinion it is a horrible system with pathetic songs. I was unable to spend more than a minute looking at it before the disgusting smell of plastic overwhelmed me. Over four months later it still smells just as bad. I highly recommend NOT BUYING THIS!",1.0
"The shipping was prompt, but the product is crap! Nothing like what was advertised, infact this is VERY false representation. The game has an original nintendo look to it, and no well known songs, also the music is such bad quality, seriously like listening to atari. DONT buy this product, you will regret it. I only wish I had read the reviews, before buying it. It would have saved me from the extreme disappointment.",1.0
"This game pad was wretched- it has very limited sensitivity and the graphics were broken. The music was in midi format- (Like listening to atari) and not at all fun.
Also: it only takes batteries. If you buy it in the store, it includes an AV converter to plug it in, but the cheap-o's at this company remove that from the box.
DO NOT BUY THIS!",1.0
"I would love to write a review for this product that I ordered, but I can't. Because, the post office deemed it ""unshippable"" so it was returned and I got a refund. If you order this, be warned, you may be disappointed such as I was.",1.0
"As with the previous reviewers this is not worth the money spent on shipping. I would gladly spend double the cost to send it back. It might as well be labeled DDR for you cellphone, the graphics and music are horrible. At least your cell phone could play decent music. Doom had better music to dance too. As I too bought this not wanting to spend the money on a console it not worth it. You'll be sorely disappointed. mannyman",1.0
"I wish i would have read more customer reviews before i wasted my time waiting for this game.  I was trying to avoid buying a playstation because i don't play video games but this is just sad.  Horrible horrible graphics, songs don't have any kind of beat. do not waste your time.",1.0
If you're looking for an atari quality video game then this is your game. I thought that the graphics as well as the music was absolutely horrible.,1.0
"This is a very cheap version of DDR.  It shouldn't be worth paying anything at all for it.  Most of the time it doesn't register the steps and even though there are 50 songs, they have no distinguishable beat and are really cheaply produced.  I cant think of one good reason to buy this game.",1.0
"I had an understanding when I purchased this item that it would not be as good as the PS2/Xbox versions (esp. concerning the graphics) but I thought that the sound (advertised as ""stereo quality"") would make it worth saving money. I was dead wrong. I don't know how sensitive the pad actually is because the songs were too indiscernable to find a beat. Don't waste your money on this product.",1.0
"I did not get any instructions with this, so we basically had to try to figure it out.

I would not buy this if I had to do again.",1.0
"This item stinks! It is a 2004 version but my mother says it should be 1984 technology! My father says it looks and reminds him of PacMan!!!(But it's not as good as PacMan!) Do not be stupid and not read the reviews cause thats what i did!

This product is horrible so DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
"I wasn't ready to purchase a gaming system, so ordered the DDR TV Pad as a gift for my daughter.  Not only are the graphics and music terrible, but the pad wasn't anywhere near as sensitive as the PS2 and Xbox versions.  My daughter quickly became frustrated as 95% of her steps didn't register.  I would recommend waiting until you can afford a gaming system.",1.0
"Junk is about all that this product is.

I bought this for my two daughters (7 & 8at the time) for last Christmas.  They were not excited about it.  They tried it once and could not keep up.  They felt very frustrated and never played it again.  The music and graphics stink.,1.0
This is one of the cheapest made products I have ever purchased in my life. The music is not real songs just a bunch of electronic noises and the graphics are so 1980's. It reminds me of an Atari game I got when they first came out. I purchased two for gifts but then ended up sending them back. One even looked like it had been used then reboxed as new. The seller has no phone number so you have to email them. They won't pay for return shipping nor will they refund original shipping charges to you. Make sure you pay with the Amazon payment system because you can us their A-Z Gtd to get your money back.,1.0
Some people believe it was a mod that added content to the GTA:SA. but the mod wasn't a mod at all but unlocked content that was already in the game. Without the mod however there was no way to get the hidden scene. On the console version you have to use a gameshark or similar device.,1.0
Video does not work and device is rather flimsy.,1.0
"Didn't work, don't buy this.",1.0
This device came to me all broken up and returning it was a hassle.,1.0
This thing was lighter than air and broke as soon as I tried to plug something in. Don't waste your pennies.,1.0
"This switch is very poor quality, but the thing I really didn't like about it is that from a cable management point of view it just couldn't be worst. The cables come in from four different directions which turns your system into a cable rats nest. I used it for about a week until the Cables to Go 28750 4x2 SVideo/Composite/Stereo Audio Selector Switch arrived from Amazon. This unit has 3 of the input  connectors and the 2 output connectors on the same side of the box with the switches and the other input connector on the other side of the box. This is a much cleaner approach to cable management and works much better from the user standpoint.",1.0
"I find the quality very lacking an am afraid to swithc it from one system to the other as the switch is so flimsy if you don't hv just right the quality of the picture is compromised and unsatisfactory. for the cost it isn't worth sending back, but I definitely wouldn't recomend this purchase to anyone",1.0
"The item did not work at all.  After plugging in all of the cords, nothing happened.  The idea is good, but the product is junk.",1.0
I didn't think for the price this was going to be the best product. It did not work properly for me; I believe only one of the switches actually worked. It was not worth the hassle of trying to get it replaced or a new one. I noticed only later that Amazon carries more expensive but I am guessing better products also.,1.0
This switch is a piece of junk. Both the video and audio output terminals are intermittent. I can see why they lowered the price. It should be zero.,1.0
"Bought three of these pretty cheap.  didn't have high expectations based on proice.  Took 6-8 weeks to get to me.  I forgot that I even ordered them.  They lived up to my expectations, but the the price was right.  I'll have to spend a little more money next time.",1.0
It arrived broken and never worked. Can tell that it is a super cheaply made product. Spend a little more money to get one that will actually work.,1.0
"Did not work. Took forever to get here, did not work. Would have cost more to return it and get a replacement or refund than it was worth. Went to the trash.",1.0
"When I first hooked up the item, things worked very smooth. It did exactly what I needed it to do without any hassle...
But shorty after (a few weeks) the item is having major problems.. It might be the cord it shipped with, or the signal it's sending out, but it's not working like it should any more. I have a new TV with more hookups and don't exactly need this product anymore, so it just sits around, broken.",1.0
"I must have received a faulty product. I'm glad to see it worked for others, however, it didn't work for me. I've tried the suggested configuration on the diagram shown on the product encasing. Didn't work. I've tried different cables (thinking it could be a faulty cable) but no, it still didn't work. All I get is a half-way, static sound connection and no video. I'm assuming one of the sound connections (either the Left or Right) and the Video doesn't work. The product is a great idea but with poor execution and cheap materials (including the flimsy encasing.) I'm quite unhappy with it. Just a warning to those who would like to purchase this. Most unfortunately, it is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".",1.0
"I was able to sometimes get the video and occasionally one of the audio sides to work, but if I switched to a different component and back I would often lose what I had working.  My husband offered to open it up and try to fix it, but I decided to return it and ordered a different one from here.  Though it may have been cheaper to do the former...

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032ANC8M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 is what I got instead and everything is working fine with it.  So spend a few ($6-7) more dollars and get one that actually works!",1.0
Not worth shipping back as a return because it costs less than shipping. The item did not work out if one side which defeated the entire purpose of the item. Waste of effort. Made of cheap materials. Didn't even want to bother writing this but I don't want other people to be as pissed off as I am,1.0
"To say that this barely works is to give it a kindness of which it is unworthy. It literally did nothing when it was fresh out of the box, but at five dollars, what do you expect? Not only did this do nothing, it was also scratched up before I so much as opened it. The whole thing is utterly pointless, the single most efficient way of wasting money short of ordering blu-ray players and sending them to strangers.",1.0
This item did not work.  The video port was OK but neither of the Audio Ports worked at all.  I have junked it.,1.0
"I usually wouldn't tell someone not to buy from a company, if I received a defective product. It's going to happen w/ electronic devices. However, when I received this A/V switch and opened the box, the switch was already falling out of the packaging. It was obvious that it had been opened previously because someone stapled it back together. Further, the a/v cords were just bunched up and shoved back into the package (no twisty tie or anything). However, I still figured I'd plug it in and give it a go, as it looked new. If it worked fine, no worries. However, I plugged my compenents into the switch and only the audio would work... no video. Tried all 3 inputs... audio but no video. So, I could only conlude that the video output jack was bad or not soldered correctly.

"I haven't even made it to the testing stage to see if all 3 inputs work. There are several reviews saying 1 or 2 or even all 3 inputs don't work so we'll see. I'm doubtful. The RCA cables provided with the product are the thinnest and cheapest feeling I've ever seen. I plugged the video cable into the back of the TV without applying much force at all. Didn't move it perpendicular to the jack in the slighest. The end of the pin snapped off in the jack, creating a very frustrating situation with the TV's future at risk. Thankfully they don't call me MacGyver for nothing. I had to heat up the end of a needle while holding it with pliers, push the red hot needle tip into the plastic middle of the stuck pin and wait for it to cool and then pull it out with said pliers.

I find it ridiculous that the cheapness of this product nearly cost us a TV, or the expense of taking it somewhere and having someone else deal with it. A real piece of crap.",1.0
"Easy plug and play, all outputs work, but all of them caused background horizontal lines traveling through my TV.  Tried direct from my cable, and it was fine.  Plugged it back through the switch box, and lines come up, and they're there from all of the outputs.  Also the RCA cables that came with it very very thin and flimsy.  Perhaps they're the cause for the lines.  I think I'll try connecting with better cables before returning the product.",1.0

The design of the AV switcher is nice and what appealed to me. Output ports in the back and the inputs forward facing. Everything else is trash. The AV ports don't hold the cables in.

"Well, one of the cords lasted almost a day, the other is still working, however, I had to secure it myself due to the lack of quality on this product.

The wiring is not shielded, but so far, no interference. The wiring goes into the connection harness, however, it is a push through hole and has no anchoring. The only thing holding the connector to the wiring is the soldering points. I have not even put any pressure on the wire, and it fell apart. The other I taped up so that the wiring would not be constantly pulling on the connection points.

I pulled apart the one that broke and found the connectors to be made of a poor quality that had oxidation and corrosion. The wire guage is so small that a soldering iron will melt right through the wiring. 3 of the connections were broken at the pin/wire soldering point, and the others were broken pins themselves.

BE WARNED...... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3, and bought a physical copy of this game......the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will. Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before, but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then. HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games. I'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better, but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio. Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help, but I haven't tried that either. I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat. To the future gamers!",1.0

"I *hate* this game.  Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.

You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.

You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.

It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.

Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.

The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.

WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.

WWF War Zone also started the popular ""create a wrestler"" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.

I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.

If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.",1.0
"There's several things I want to say about this ""limited edition"" ogre battle. It is ""like"" the super nes versioin the way that you still control the battle from over head and you get the tarot cards etc...but they ""updated"" the graphics and make some changes in the way the battle map is displayed, gave the characters a little battle action movement, meaning: they give the fighters a little more swing in their sword and the spells have a little more action in them. You are also given the option of watching the battle action movement of character (how they swing etc) different formations for your ""stock"" including listing by str, agi, ali, charisma and more. That sounds great right? not so much and here's why...

They (meaning Atlus) changed the size ratio and now the map won't your TV screen, the game lags and sputters (you can watch the battle curser aka sword sputter like a old nissan across the battle map, the reputation bar is so skinny and tall you cant really see where you stand in reputation cuase it looks like you are at neutral at all times. The time it takes to save or load your game is ridiculous! Several times I thought the game had frozen when it was really just saving. There's also the loading time to each map which is also too long and when you are searching for treasure and the game keeps giving you baddies and you need to reset/reload the game you can plan on taking up a second hobby to fill in the time to reload the game AND the area map. They changed the intro music to the game and it now sounds like tactics ogre?? Identity crisis? Hey Atlus maybe you should recall all the people from ""quest"" and then redo the game. THE BEST part instead of the original ogre battle where the troops would take whatever land movement they were best suited for and come for other towns and your troops, NOW The enemies go straight to your base???!!!??? What the hey! Just stand at your base and defend it. No strategy required.

I call this atlus "" Perfecting the already perfect"". If you want to play ogre battle re-buy a SNES and get the real deal.",1.0

"Where to begin with this train wreck of a game.  Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better.

Story and Characters
They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game.

Play Control
Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity.

Stages & Backgrounds
The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring.

Challenge
This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid.

Verdict
Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

"...in order as I did and were old enough to discern the difference in quality between the first two and this game you may despise this game as much as I did/do. My main problem with TM3 is that it has terrible physics for a fast action game. Flipping over every two seconds during high adrenaline moments was not fun for me. It felt too loose, like every car was some giant 70's mobile or something. In my view the best Twisted Metal experience can be had with TM1, TM2, and TM: Black. I also highly recommend Rogue Trip, the game most of the same developers made after making TM2.",1.0

I found none of these things.  There are only 4 new characters, Club Kid, Auger, Flamethrower, and my favorite new driver, Flower Power.  The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun.  The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level.  The graphics are cheesy, and 989 studios tried to make them look too real.  The cars flip over with every tight turn you make, when another car hits you, or you drive onto a hill.  This game is not realistic.  This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title.  I warn you, do not even look at this game.  It is the worst.  The car combat genre is in shame.",1.0

Arguably the best game of all time but seriously what are you thinking selling the cartridge for this much? If it was factory sealed and never opened then the price is still a little high but this is a straight rip off for the cartridge. Ebay has this game for bids starting at $5 and never really goes past $25 even for the gold edition. Also your local game swap carries it for $20 normally.,1.0

"I was so happy when I ordered a new Tomb Raider III video game, and received it on time. When I received my package, and  opened it, I was very disappointed because my product was damaged and looked like it had been stomped on by children. This was my first time ever ordering merchandise online by Amazon for Galactics. I can say on honestly, on a positive note Amazon and Galactics resolved my issue immediately which I appreciate very much. I wish I had the opportunity to play the game I always wanted as a child.",1.0
"Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.

If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the ""running around half-naked female shooter/adventure"" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.

Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)

It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.

By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.

At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.

Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.

BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.",1.0
"It was difficult to get it to work. Once it finally started, it continued to freeze. Does not match the quality listed",1.0
"This game is ok, but mostly mediocre. This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.
Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor.
So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title. Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least. They haven't made anything decent since though",1.0

"I adore the TR games & I have completed them all except for this one.  I have tried to get into it and have started it on 3 separate occasions.  I just do not find it fun.  The most frustrating aspect is the save crystals.  This game is unreasonably hard in some sections yet you are afraid to save and waste a save crystal in case you need it more later on.  I don't feel the crystals add to the challenge of the game.  They just make the game annoying.
Don't waste your time and money.  Just enjoy the rest of the TR series and pretend this one didn't happen.",1.0
"When I first got the game a few months ago, I was really excited and played the heck out of it, but I ended up having to take a break due to life getting busy. When I come back to play the game, it turned out that it had erased my save that I had put 30 hours into. It was really depressing and I am very unhappy that my time was wasted. I wouldn't recommend buying it from this seller, as they obviously don't check their games for these issues.",1.0

When I ran the grand prix as the most pretentious character in this game as a four year old against my dad I never conceived the notion that it would one be worth $60 just because its a Mario Kart game. I'm not sure how to feel about that because it sure as hell isn't a rare game that justifies such a price tag. My advice to anyone who wants this game is to go prod garage sale and get it for a buck. Its not rare or special in any way what so ever and you will find it if you look around enough.,1.0

This game is overated. I got this game I got this for christmas this year and i was disapointed with goldeneye. All you have to do is run past stupid guards. The guns don't have real names. PP7? Its PPK. You even hear that in the movie. The guards all have the same faces. This is more like a russian massacre. I once put a happy face infront of a gaurd and he didn't notice. The solo missions are boring. Bond is not supposed to go to the bunker. The multi player is boring unless there are 3 or 4 players. This game is only good for people who really like bond,1.0
"If anyone knows how to escape from the giant magic tree, please god contact me. Ive been stuck there for 6 years and its causing sleep loss, dperession etc. Anyways, i don't like this game very much, although probably becauase ive lost many friends due to the thousands of hours ive commited to its luminous glow and wind boggling theme tune.

"I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting, although it started to run thin by the ending levels. Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.
Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.
Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities. If you want a weekend of pure hell (both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely) then buy this game.  Otherwise, don't bother.",1.0
